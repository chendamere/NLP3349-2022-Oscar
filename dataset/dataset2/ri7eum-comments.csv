hovllvi,"What a great film on so many levels! Can‚Äôt tell you how much this took me back to being a kid again all those years ago watching Spider-man on the big screen for the very first time. 

Loved how they didn‚Äôt just throw Andrew and Tobey in there as a gimmick or brief cameo, but allowed them to dive further into the progression of their characters and get closure after so many years. Andrew in particular absolutely crushed it, from his vulnerability and relief upon saving MJ to the love and validation he received from the older, wiser Tobey on positive self-talk. You could tell he was hurting the whole time, and yet this was a healing process for him.

On the other hand, I kept thinking about Tom finally having his origin story come full circle (somewhat akin to the running theme from Into the Spider-verse, like we were watching his comic book moment happen in real time). It broke my heart to see him lose Aunt May and connection to his friends, MJ, even the other Avengers. However, it felt like this all needed to happen in a way so he could finally be ready and set off on his own. In that final shot as he‚Äôs swinging through the city with his new duds I could hear Tony‚Äôs voice echoing from that first film: ‚Äúif you‚Äôre nothing without this suit, then you shouldn‚Äôt have it.‚Äù He‚Äôs been through so much, but it‚Äôs shaped him and matured him into the person we‚Äôve always known and loved, ready to kick ass and lend a helping hand as your friendly neighborhood Spider-man.",ri7eum

hoxqm82,"People don't clap in UK theaters, it's a US thing.

Like, throughout my entire life, I'd say 90% of theater showings there would just be no clapping ever, only the occasional laugh or gasp, and for the rest, if someone clapped the audience would immediately shush them. That's the UK.

When Andrew Garfield came out of that portal, the audience gasped, and then I'd say half the audience cheered and started applauding. 

Then for Tobey, then for the end of the film.

I cannot explain enough how weird it is for UK audiences to be applauding. It's not a thing, at all. It's like going up to a stranger and asking them to pull their trousers down.

Andrew appearing got the biggest applause of the film, and I think about how much he loves Spider-Man and how sad he was after his solo films, and I just really like that.

EDIT: Fun fact, if you say 'I've not really experienced something' about the UK and say it's majority US (from evidence of a bunch of screenings online), turns out you'll get everyone coming out the woodwork to prove you wrong even though you never said 100% lol.

Peter practicing his lines to reintroduce himself to his friends only to stop short when he sees the bandage on MJ's face from the fight. ""It doesn't hurt anymore"". And then pocketing the letter, with perhaps the notion that they're better off without being involved with Spider-man. Part of me hopes that Peter, MJ, and Ned find their way back into each other's lives in the new trilogy but I also wouldn't mind Peter moving forward. 

With the knowledge that there's another trilogy in store for us, it makes the ""Home Trilogy"" feel like a prologue to Spider-man proper. With really no backup at all now, Peter bravely goes into the world donning his hand made spidey suit. 

It'll be interesting to see where they take Spidey in the new trilogy and how this ""everyone forgot Peter Parker"" works. One of the shots in the end is a box with a GED test guide in it (USA High School diploma equivalent for individuals who didn't finish or attend HS in the states), so it implies the spell has definitely affected the reality to a point where it's even affected his official records.

* Peter clearly recognizes at the end of the movie while seeing MJ's band-aid that if he were to try to be in her life again that he is only going to cause her and Ned more pain.

* Obviously Garfield was charismatic as hell but Holland's anger and sadness right before he almost killed Green Goblin is peak acting for him next to telling Tony Stark that he doesn't want to die.

* I love that this sets up the next chapter in Spider-Man's life. Him being alone and fighting crime in New York is always how I personally pictured Spider-Man. Maybe he'll meet his Gwen Stacy, Black Cat or Harry Osborne. 

* Obviously Symbiotic Spider-Man is happening!!!!!

* Love that we got a callback to the [original Green Goblin outfit](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/26485/522341-green_goblin_iii.jpg) with Dafoe's purple hoodie outfit.

It's like some Dave Chappelle ""so I kicked her in the pussy"" shit.  In the months / years before this movie, Sony and Marvel have been just telling us the punchline with how they've been expanding the Spider-verse with tons of new spin-off movies and hints at crossovers.  Despite that, it was only at the end of this movie that it suddenly became so obvious what their intent was.  Marvel and Sony needed to decouple Spider-man from the MCU so that he can function as an independent character to better set-up the Spider-verse and they pulled it off.  This movie was meant to be a soft reset for the character.

It's so obvious that was one of the purposes of this movie at the end yet it didn't feel obvious throughout the movie.  I had gotten lost in the story-telling.

When other franchises try to do this, they almost always fail at it.  So often the punchline feels forced, unearned, unnatural, or out of place.  But, at the end of this movie, it felt like just taking another step forward for the character.",ri7eum

Dr. Strange is completely incompetent and casts any spell Spiderman asks him to throughout the movie, Aunt May tasks her high school nephew to care for psychotic super-villains because one presented with mental illness, Spiderman takes all supervillains out of cells to an apartment instead of bringing the device to the liar and curing them one by one, the list goes on and on. Spiderman also could've just asked Dr. Strange to make everyone forget about Mysterio or his message smh.

hovr4ds,"What I liked about it is that, when you get to the end of the movie, it is literally his origin story.   


People keep saying that ""he lacked an origin"" or a ""motivation"". I believe this is it. Losing his loved ones, losing his identity, his assets that were not his to begin with. And then having the heart to go through it all. He was na√Øve, now he is wiser.  We always regard him as ""a spiderman"" or ""tom holland's spiderman"". But damn, he is literally THE spiderman, along with Tobey's and Andrew's.  


What I also liked was the sassiness of Andrew and innocence of Tobey were things you kinda love and hate in their respective movies, but they owned those personalities showing a new dynamic between spidermen. I have not wanted to see a sequel to a Spiderman as much as i do with No Way Home. I love Tobey and Andrew movies, but No Way Home made it so I loved them even more. Maybe there are some stuff that are bad that critics will find, but this movie is in my heart along with spiderman 2 and the amazing spider man 1.",ri7eum

hoveqzk,"Fucking HELL. What a goddamn movie.

-Perfect reintroduction of Matt Murdock into the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù MCU, similar to Doctor Strange‚Äôs role in Ragnarok, that being that it could‚Äôve very easily not been in the movie and nothing would‚Äôve changed, but still an excellent addition.

-Pinpointing the exact moment where Ock was pulled into the MCU, being that 30-second window where he knew Peter was Spider-Man, but hadn‚Äôt regained control of his arms yet was perfect and literally the only way it would make sense for him to still be a villain

-Sandman initially trying to help Peter was my first ‚Äúoh god i love this‚Äù instance of the movie. I‚Äôm glad they kept his entire arc intact. It was weird to keep him in sand form the whole time but it was a cool visual.

-Green Goblin was fucking psychotic and an excellent evolution of his personality from the 2002 movie. He was already crazy in Spider-Man 1 but here he was completely unhinged, and Dafoe was sensational. I definitely loved that they took the time to point out that Norman Osborn is still a good person that wants to help, but the Goblin side was stronger.

-The plot of reforming the villains to save their lives was surprisingly wholesome

-Doctor Strange vs Spider-Man was visually insane and probably my 2nd favorite magic fight, after Strange vs Thanos, and Tom using math to beat him was a nice touch

-I wish i cared more about MCU Aunt May for her death scene to be more effective, but i just spent the last 2 days watching the Alpha Aunt May, Rosemary Harris, so maybe that‚Äôs on me. Still very effective and a great way to get the ‚Äúwith great power‚Äù line into the franchise

-Andrew being introduced as being confused, fully costumed, walking down an alley was just really funny

-Tobey stopping Andrew‚Äôs self doubt with a ‚Äúlisten, you‚Äôre amazing. You are amazing‚Äù was really goddamn great, and worked for the character and for Andrew Garfield himself, given the reception of his movies.

-Andrew apologizing to Electro for not being black üòÇ

-Doc Ock talking to Tobey was just beautiful

-This is 100% on me because I‚Äôve watched the older movies so many goddamn times, but i could tell the ‚Äúcured‚Äù versions of Lizard and Sandman were repurposed shots of Thomas Haden Church and Rhys Ifans from SM3 and ASM respectively 

-The swerve of changing the spell to have everyone forget about Peter Parker in general, not just forgetting the secret identity, was definitely unexpected and sets the stage for something brand new in the next movie

-Another unfortunate thing about everyone forgetting about Peter is i realllly like the potential of Strange taking Ned as an apprentice 

-How do you give Peter a landlord and not make it Mr Ditkovitch for one last surprise

Maybe im being spoiled but i really hope this isn‚Äôt the last time we see Tobey and Andrew on screen, whether they‚Äôre together or not. 

If they had stuck to the original plans and left the multiverse completely out of the marketing and made that entire part of the plot a secret, similar to how Endgame was marketed, I genuinely might‚Äôve passed out in the theater üòÇ with Endgame you knew everyone had to come back somehow, but this would‚Äôve been *completely* out of nowhere.

What a great movie... seeing all these characters interacting was amazing, didn't think it would be possible to see Andrew/Tobey sharing a screen with Holland. I hope they return in their own universe or come back for Multiverse or Secret War. Charlie Cox back as Daredevil with Kingpin in Hawkeye, really wonder if they are the same character or different. Andrew saving MJ, Ned using magic. That Dr Strange fight was trippy and cool. Doctor Strange patching the Multiverse and you see silhouettes of Scorpion, Kraven, Black Cat, and Rhino. 

Had me watery eyed a couple times in this movie from nostalgia and just the emotional bits they did. Spider bros with the money shot and hugging it out, Miles Morales hints with Electro, the pointing meme, them being scientist trying to help their villains. Great power part, Iron Spider Claws vs Tentacles. Spiderman getting a fresh start without all the tech with the One More Day story arc from comics. Spiderman not knowing his friends or having a family is tough too. Spidey with his classic suit at the end... man I can just go on.

hovrszw,"Wow, just got back from a showing, and despite having heard the Tobey/Andrew/Charlie spoilers, I managed to leave with quite a few surprises! Not a perfect movie, but I enjoyed it a lot. Some boiled down thoughts:

* Did not see Aunt May's death coming until right beforehand. She fulfilled the Uncle Ben tragedy and it works for this Spidey.
* Peter moving in broke to a crappy apartment and going back to a homemade Spider-Man suit is such a perfect ending. This was his Spidey origin story/trilogy.
* Peter changing his mind on talking to MJ after seeing the bandage was such a nice subtle touch that reinforces the classic sacrifice his own happiness for their safety trope of all Spider-Man media.
* Was happy to see Tobey again, but was very surprised by how much I enjoyed Andrew. He really nailed it here between the humor and the anguish of Gwen's death. His reaction when he saved MJ hit me. I still love the ASM2 suit.
* Love the plot of curing/redeeming the villains. So happy Doc Ock's ""cure"" stuck and that he helped them in the end. 
* Willem Dafoe killed it. That laugh still gives me the chills.
* Molina was great too. Loved seeing him and Dafoe interact in character for the first time, as the two knew each other in universe.
* The ""nobody remembers Peter"" ending works in-universe to establish the classic Spidey, but also I'm guessing this is an out-of-universe out to write Spider-Man out of the MCU in case they don't do any more deals.
* The Tom Hardy mid credits was both funny and an interesting hook.
* Post credits: Bring on the MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS!",ri7eum
hoxt6bd,"I really can‚Äôt believe some of you mad bastards wanted to read spoilers and know everything that was going to happen before you watched it. Is it an anxiety thing?

Man. I deleted Reddit, Facebook, and YouTube to make sure nothing popped up. So glad I did. These NEEDED to be surprises in my opinion. 

Also.. dare I say.. I love Andrew Garfield again? What great redemption for him. The MJ catch scene.. fucking.. wow. And him crying after doing it right that time about broke me. 

Tobey, who was supposed to be the bigger return felt really great still. But because he‚Äôs not ass bouncy as Tom and Andrew and is the more tame one of the three, it actually wasn‚Äôt quite as stand out. Not due to his acting. Just sue to the specific type of Peter he is.

Even Electro who I wasn't a fan of at all in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was way more enjoyable this time around. 

Maguire and Garfield coming back was everything I wanted it to be. Every fan service moment possible was done and I'm eternally grateful to them for it. And then of course, Matt Murdock and Peter Parker in the same room, looking and acting exactly like he did on Netflix complete with a superpower tease.

Didn't even felt like acting on that scene right there -- just brutal and raw emotion. I'm honestly amazed at what a freaking amazing actor Andrew is and what a month for him since Tick, Tick Boom just recently released as well.   


Literal fanservice or not this Spiderman installment was such a dream come true for us fans, goosebumps when both of them appeared and instantly got me memory jogging back to 2002 where it all started. Just a surreal experience. Thank you to everyone who made this multiverse version possible for us all!",ri7eum
hovms7w,"**FINALLY**, Peter is broke. That was the one thing that bugged me the most about Holland's Spider-Man. One of Peter's defining traits is that he always struggling for cash. He comes from a working lower class background and seems to be forever stuck there no matter who he saves or what he does. On occasion, someone would give him money but something would happen and he would find himself back to square one with the bills piling up. But in the MCU, Peter really didn't have that problem. Especially with the moment Stark started footing the bills. But now Peter has lost everything and is on his own. He's living from paycheck to paycheck in a strangely still roomy apartment for NYC. But still, he's broke. He's no longer Spider-Man: The Avenger. Peter is just your friendly neighborhood Spider-man now.

God, it looked like Garfield was having a blast in this movie. He really loves playing Peter. And, dang, he's cute. 

Loved how Peter 1 and Peter 3 were both awe, dumbfounded and morbidly curious about Peter 2's ability to make webbing. I, too, would be wondering if it came out from any place else.

I love the chemistry between Holland, Zendaya and Batalon. They have such a strong friendship vibe that held this entire movie together. You really believe that this group would die for each other. And having Peter walk away from MJ and Ned knowing full well that they are better off without him and he would only bring trouble in their lives was so heartbreaking. 

Having Ned's Grandma asking Peter to clean some corner cobwebs while he was still on the ceiling was hilarious. And it made me wish that I had Peter's powers too. It would make for changing bulbs in ceiling lights that much easier.

I loved to have Matt Murdock back. And, God, such a nice save with the brick. I don't think there were many Daredevil fans in my theater because I was the only who reacted to him. Meanwhile when Tobey and Andrew showed up, spontaneous applause broke out. Now that we have Cox in Peter's universe, I would love if future Spider-Man movies could have more Murdock in them. I don't want this one and done thing. They did that with Eddie and Venom which while it's great to see Hardy, kind of sucked to have him yanked back to his own universe without any interaction with Peter. 

Hey, there was a Rogers: The Musical billboard in the background. Nice touch. Somewhere out there, Hawkeye is dealing with his own mess to even worry about Peter's. 

Damn, they made this universe's Aunt May Peter's Uncle Ben with that, ""with great power comes great responsibility."" Did not see her death coming. After she died, I thought everyone except Holland's Peter was up for grabs on this death watch. 

""I thought you would be black."" (snort) Somewhere out there Miles' ears are burning.

Speaking of which, there were quite a few shots that reminded me of Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse. I wonder if I am seeing things or if Webb grabbed some ideas from that movie for his. I mean, if you are going to steal, steal from the best as they say.

Peter 2 calling Peter 3, ""amazing,"" was a little on the nose but still, I thought it was a cute joke. 

I love all the bizarre touches in the Sanctum Sanctorum. The doll moving on its own crept the bejeezus out of me. And the gross magical food in the fridge was straight out of Jason Aaron's run of the Doctor Strange comic. I thought for a second they were going to reveal that one woman doing the snow work in the house was Zelma. If not, I hope Zelma shows up in a future Doctor Strange movie.

The only problem I had with this movie is why would Eddie be pulled into this universe if he had no idea who Peter Parker is?

I want to see this movie again.

hpsfm1x,"Despite me liking the movie overall, a few major plot holes exist :

Dr. Strange became a very inconsistent character. He doesn't discuss the terms of the spell and just goes straight into casting it, and is willing to let the multiverse crumble instead of cast a spell that will make everyone forget Peter and needs Peter to demand he does it. Electro shouldn't be there at all as he himself in the end admits he doesn't know who Peter Park was. If they remove their powers and send them back aren't the still sending them back to die? As we can assume they are sending them back to the moment they were taken, now without a fighting chance? Why did he release a bunch of supervillains from their cells and think they would just behave instead of making their ""cure"" and sending it into the cell with them to see if it works?

Overall I do like the more bleak direction and the MCU Peter finally being forced to develop for himself instead of being Ironman junior again. Andrew was always my favorite version of the character so it was nice to have more time with him, and to have them tease a possible return of his character in the future via him talking about fighting aliens and Jamie Foxx Electro hopefully alluding to him tutoring a Miles Morales. (I know that might have only been meant to reference the Spiderverse movie, but I can hope).",ri7eum

hov9krx,"An absolute treat of a movie. It was fun, fast paced, emotional, and had some of the best fights in the MCU. Some of my favorite moments...

* #""You know, I'm something of a scientist myself.""

* Holland's 'spidey sense' for the Goblin in the apartment was intense.

* The Devil of Hell's Kitchen himself Charlie ^mf Cox in the MCU! Great reflexes, too.

* The apartment fight between Goblin and Spider-Man was visceral. They were just going all out on each other and it was glorious. 

* ""The power of the sun in the palm of my hand.""

* The dynamic and banter between all 3 Spider-Men was hilarious, all so well written.

* Tobey stopping the glider going thru Dafoe, clearly something he greatly regrets in his universe and able to stop it this time. He sold that scene nicely.

Ultimately is a good movie in part because of all the callbacks/nostalgia/etc. But the movie is smart enough to use callbacks in service of the story, and not as a substitute for the lack of a story. It's why this fan service works here and doesn't in so many other movies. 

As much as I liked seeing Molina again as Doc Oc, it was Dafoe that stole the villain show. God damn I said GAWD DAMN he is such an amazing actor. His Goblin is such a menacing antagonist.

Also, some things you just have to roll with. Tobey being stabbed in the back and thru the gut and being basically fine afterwards. Or Ned having the ability to do by accident what sorcerers spend dedicated training to do. Or Parker not just bringing a yearbook to MJ and being all ""*we are classmates*"". Or Holland taking a Goblin bomb to the face and being fine. I'm just chalking it up to the fact that the MCU has always been sloppy with regards to ""*realism.*"" 

Overall I'd give this an 8/10 for an MCU Spidey movie.",ri7eum
hova7x4,"‚ÄúJon Watts was a hero, I just couldn‚Äôt see it‚Äù
Nah but in all honesty what a movie man, Marvel u sneaky devils, y‚Äôall were planning the long game. Great fucking ending. Just ages the Raimi and Webb films like fucking wine",ri7eum
hovla4k,"Saw it at Times Square AMC. I couldn't hear the Matt Murdock dialogue because the crowd went insane. It wasn't the only time, but that was the first, the biggest surprise I suppose, and was cut to be much more immediate (versus the way the other Spider-Men appeared). A 'theater experience' kind of movie. 

There's all sorts of obvious comments to be made but I'll focus on what was most interesting to me: that while there was some very standard and expected stuff in this movie, the meta element to the story created some very interesting storytelling opportunities that for once, I think, provide a valid argument for this kind of nostalgia-driven effort to actually be greater than the sum of its parts. This is delivered by the 'every Peter Parker has his trials' concept, the Ben/Gwen/May parallel. This not only creates a more textured variations-on-a-theme presentation, but addresses, retroactively, the decision of Holland Spider-Man's originless introduction-via-cameo in Civil War. People have written a lot on how Super Hero movies are bogged down by the necessities of regurgitated origin stories, which the MCU then did away with for their new Spidey. Yet leaving it out has always left him in an unusual position, somehow less grounded in a shared universe so HEAVY  in continuity. In this movie, we have our retroactive answer to this issue: if Peter never felt like quite the genuine article, perhaps it was because he had yet to go through his own Spider's Journey. We didn't SKIP his origin story, we just hadn't reached it until this film, an origin at the END of a trilogy of trilogies (well, ok, one was only 2 films).

And maybe that's reading too much into it, but I think it is the one thing about the film that really makes it unique and interesting. Beyond that, these scenes motivate the best performances out of the cast: on the roof, exchanging the painful-yet-immature ""you don't know what I've been through"" with the pained glances from the more mature counterparts who we know have experienced it exactly. Or Garfield-Spidey's MJ-as-Gwen save, and his reaction when he realizes he has redeemed his failure. That one isn't just a pump-your-fist triumph in the context of the films, but the catharsis to a half-century long pop-cultural memory.

Ultimately? A lot of the film is silly, filled with MCU standbys, familiar-but-competent action, and nostalgia-laden yet gloriously sinister (heh) villains. But I think, in the stuff above, it actually manages something a bit beyond the average MCU megahit.",ri7eum

The unfair consequences of wanting to do right by everyone, taken to the extreme by leaving him broke, orphaned and forgotten by everybody, and yet still going out to protect people in a costume of his own making, with no fancy tech on? Great

Maybe it was intentional and they come from a universe that is similar to the Raimiverse and not the actual Raimiverse we know.

Dr. Strange, who is very smart and can see the future, is willing to risk the fabric of the time-space continuum destroying the universe, just because 3 kids couldn't GET INTO COLLEGE? The plot is so forced. Dr. Strange suggests to Peter (Tom Holland) at the beginning, to erase his memory so carelessly and he is also about to do it. There is no emotion or doubt in Dr. Strange's mind as he is casting a spell to completely remove Peter from everyone's minds. But at the end of the movie, he becomes so dramatic and teary at the thought of erasing Peter (fyi 1000s of villaisn are spawing left and right, when he is doubting something he was so convinced to do a few days ago). There are so many inconsistencies with Dr. Strange's character. Also, the cube that can send every villain back to their universes! Why just click it from his desk and send everyone back? Why does Dr. Strange have to bring the box into a room full of said villains, and a teenager who has 0 maturity to deal with such things. (If anyone things, he made things better, that's not true. He lost Aunt May. Killed people because of all the chaos. And had himself rid of everyone's memories. If you think murderous villains deserve a chance over innocent people's lives, then you blind!) Coming back to the box thing, Tom Holland spiderman eventually steels the box from Dr. Strange and ruins the whole thing. Dr. Strange is uncharacteristically so dumb in the whole movie.

And coming to Tom Holland spdierman. He does well to act like a teenager - because the character is easily swayed by villains and doesn't learn. He got fooled by the globe headed guy from the previous movie (Jake Gyllenhal character), and he learns nothing from that (btw his mistake! Because he wasn't mature enough to handle the Stark tech). In this movie, he again takes side with the bad guys, causing destruction and death. He fights against Dr strange and goes against his plans. I thought Tom Holland spiderman was supposed to be smart? 

After the last movie, where Spiderman destroys London or some city because he was careless with the Stark tech, he should have been sent to some Prof X teen titan University. That is where Tom Holland spiderman needs to go. He needs to learn to use his powers responsibly. Instead of just saying ""with great power comes great responsibility "", I'd like him to show some responsibility. Also, don't leave the balance of the world in the hands of 3 MIT graduates (they aren't that smart). Get more experienced shield professionals to deal with things.

howa13q,"Great movie but if you think about it too hard it kind of gets confusing. The lizard and sandman never died, also jamie foxx never even knew who peter parker was so idk why he was pulled through at all. Sandman was actively helping/defending Peter and then seemed super down to get healed and go home but the second things went south at the apartment he just ran away? Also the logistics of the spell at the end are kind of confusing and weird, for example its implied Ned and Peter were best friends for a long time and obviously would‚Äôve spent a lot of time together so does Ned just conveniently forget like half of his life experiences now? If someone comes along and asks MJ who her first boyfriend or love was is her brain just gonna fry and break down? Ned and MJ only met through Peter, the entire reason Happy even knew who May was because he was so close to Peter. Idk, clearly we‚Äôre not supposed to think about it that much.",ri7eum

When Peter is in his Astral form and Dr. Strange can't get the box out of his hands, Peter has the classic Spidey Sense lines emanating from his head in a kind of heat wave refraction. It's very subtle but really helps explain why his hands were moving without his Astral form being present.

2) what was the point of rounding everyone up in Strange‚Äôs jail if really he just needed to press the button on the box? Like, once Strange realized what the spell did, why not just make the box and press the button? What was the point of all the ‚Äúgathering?‚Äù

hp8njwe,"Great movie. Tobey, Andrew and Norman stole the show. Best parts of the film by far. 

3 problems:

1. Aunt May only became an actual character in the same film that she dies in, after years of being eye candy. Fucking bullshit.
2. What was the point of all that Venom build up if they were just going to send him home without ever meeting MCU Spider-Man?
3. That spell raises more questions than it answers. Wouldn't Peter's records still exist? Can he can still go to school and he just chose to start a new life or what?",ri7eum
hp8uqj6,"Why didn't Strange just cast the spell to make everyone forget Spiderman?

That would have stopped the reason everyone wanted to get peter park in the multi verse. Peter could just start back over as a small neighborhood spider man. Peter would still have his friends.

Total reboot origin story. Now he's still an avenger and everything he did still happened. It's really not origin movie. This spell only made him  lose his friends and family.

The OG Spider-Mans 1 and 2 are still the benchmark for this franchise.


But I judge a movie by how much joy and entertainment I get out of it, and I‚Äôd be lying if I absolutely didn‚Äôt adore the nostalgia and fan service. Seeing tobey in a spider suit was worth the price of admission alone.

I was expecting a typical dramatic death where, after the explosion, she would just be laying there and die.

Instead, she stands up, with her body completely high on adrenaline, euphoric, SHELL SHOCKED, walks, talks with some difficulty‚Ä¶ and only when her adrenaline rush fades away, she falls and starts to feel death coming, even then, still unaware of her internal injuries and bleeding.

Her death was uncannily‚Ä¶ realistic, and that surprised me a lot. And I think it made an even bigger impact making it look for a few seconds like she may be just fine only to then show she was only standing on her feet because of an adrenaline rush.",ri7eum

hovbmg2,"Where do I begin? Where do I begin?

I grew up with the Raimi films--I love them all. Even *Spider-Man 3* holds a special place in my heart. I'm a sucker for self-sacrifice and Harry's sacrifice is one of the best.

So what do I think of *No Way Home*?

This movie was fucking phenomenal. 

The action was some of the best I've ever seen in any Spider-Man film. There were several long, nearly continual shots in the fight scenes that lasted nearly a minute each. 

The emotions...the raw heartbreak that came from May's death. The burning rage that came with MCU-Peter wanting to get even with Goblin. 

This is Tom Holland's best showing in the MCU. He knocked it out of the park. 

The other Spider-Mans were great--Raimi-Peter is excellent as a Spidey who knows his way around being a hero and has come to terms with his role. It's satisfying. 

But Andrew Garfield--my God, Garfield was incredible here. I never really got into the ASM films, but I loved Garfield in *Hacksaw Ridge.* Seeing him here, still grieving and trying to channel it into something that mattered...it was wonderful.

And hilarious--Garfield complaining that his films weren't as good as his ""brothers"" and his declarations of love? Bravo. Bravo. Bravo!

And the villains! 

Everyone brought their A-game. 

I *loved* Sandman here. His introduction? He helps Spider-Man! There was a time back in the 80s and 90s that Sandman repented of his past sins and joined the Avengers--it's fun to see him fighting with Spider-Man on the big screen. More than fun--this is something I've always, always wanted--a real team-up! 

And the Lizard--understated compared to everybody else, but still welcome. 

Jamie Foxx was superb! He was electrifying and engaging as Electro. He was having the time of his life being a villain who was relishing his power. 

And Alfred Molina! The trailers hinted that he would be helping Peter and indeed he did. When MCU-Peter put that microchip implant back, and helped Doc Ock get his mind back...my heart ached. The sheer relief on his face...it was beautiful. 

And of course--Williem Dafoe. Dafoe...what more is there to say. He played his role as Jekyll and Hyde perfectly. A desperate man, terrified of his own demons, and the demon who relishes the suffering of others. 

 MJ! 

Ned!

Stephen Strange!

May!

They were all amazing. Spectacular. Ultimate, even. 

I loved every minute of this film. Far and away the best showing of Spidey in the MCU.

The best live-action Spidey since *Spider-Man 2.*

Bravo, bravo, bravo!",ri7eum

hozocnr,"I've been very cynical towards the MCU since Endgame. The stories following that film have felt unnecessary to me, including Far From Home, which I thought was decent but inessential, and the trailers and marketing for No Way Home felt a little desperate to me as well. 

Boy am I happy to be wrong. This was the most fun I've had watching an MCU film since Ragnarok. One could easily comb through the script for breaks in logic and continuity, but that would defeat the purpose. As with Endgame, most of the fun is mixing and matching all of these different characters and stories to create a giddy concoction you might have made up in your head as a little kid. This is a movie by and for people who love comic books and are willing to get a little silly. 

It's more than just a conceptual success though. The performances are great, especially Willem Dafoe (unexpectedly the emotional core of the film in some respects) and Zendaya, who easily gives her best yet as MJ. Her expression after she lost her memory of Peter and was trying to make sense of what she was looking at when they met again...just absolutely perfect. The script wasn't overly quippy and left lots of room for heart and emotion, particularly Peter grappling with his failures and learning to love himself via the other Peter Parkers.

The only real downsides to me were some wooden moments of fan fiction dialogue in spots, as well as some iffy CGI (not unusual for the MCU). Otherwise, I thought it was perfect for what it was and I get why this is already such a beloved entry in the MCU. It's their best in quite a while.",ri7eum

The call backs to their previous movies were dope too....I got goosebumps seeing Andrew save Zendaya and seeing Tobey stop Tom from making the same mistake he did.

Literally every character was written and performed so well. 

As someone who was a young child when watching Toby‚Äôs Spider-Man it was one of the movies that formed my love for superheroes, sci-fi and fantasy. 

And watching Garfields Spider-Man as a late teen it really caught the essence of being that age and in love and at the time I had my first love so it really gripped me it made him my favourite because of how much I related to him. 

Seeing Tom‚Äôs Spider-Man, I loved that he just jumped right into it no backstory about spider bites and I always thought not having Uncle Ben would be a bad thing UNTIL this movie.

There's one scene where Tom has his knees on Green Goblin's shoulders against a wall and is just raining down elbows and Dafoe's face is just pure surprise.

hp06zy5,"One thing I was suprised by was how much more 'real' this movie felt. Now obviously I know its Spider-Man but in some of the scenes (mainly the ones with him fighting goblin) Spider-man was much more brutal and the music was a lot less over the top. Also compared to the usual way of the spider fighting, in this movie Tom actually was using real life and brutal fighting techqinues like Muay Thai when he kept on elbowing Goblin. Elbows are much deadlier than fists and I felt that was such an awesome touch to show how Spider-man is much more blood thirsty this time around with the death of Aunt May. Also saw quite a bit of pro wrestling moves in there.

&#x200B;

Then the music being way less over the top is what made the final fight against Tom and Goblin feel so much more different than anyone big screen Spider-Man fight and I want to say any MCU fight. They really showed the sheer hatred and anger he had for Goblin for killing Aunt May by making the music very subtle and hardly even noticable and instead having the sounds of the environment, like Tom's fists echoing against the shield with the power he is using and showing how he truly is no longer, pulling his punches.",ri7eum

Like others here have already mentioned, it's nice to see Osborn actually be something of a scientist himself along with Octavius, both of them finally getting more time to breathe as redeemed characters before their inevitable deaths, but we also see Sand Man and Lizard finally get the cures they spent their previous movies looking for, which not a lot of people seem to be talking about. Even Electro gets time to shine, giving him some much-needed character development with a nice payoff of him finally being told that he isn't a nobody, which certainly gives him a lot more substance than just wanting attention before blowing up in TASM2. >!Too bad he never got to light his birthday candles, though.!<

Even though pretty much everyone already knew Maguire and Garfield would return to reprise their roles somehow, I'm glad the movie didn't get too carried away with fan service to the point of overshadowing the plot, which was my biggest concern coming in because of Sony's reputation for cramming too many characters into their Spider-Man films, which has been their biggest problem since SM3 and the main reason for all these different Spider-Man universes in the first place. Fortunately, the other Peter Parkers have just enough to do to justify their presence without feeling separated from everything else going on, which is definitely refreshing, as even Into the Spider-Verse arguably suffered from that slightly. Plus, their inclusion doubles as a nice ""passing the torch"" moment for Holland's Spider-Man going forward while also recanonizing the older films in a way.

Obviously, there's a lot to talk about, and while it's not a perfect movie, as some of the coincidences that happen in the plot feel a little too convenient at times, overall, I'm really impressed with how well it turned out. It's not often that something like this happens with movies, especially in a time where film studios are mostly just pumping out cynical reboots and retcon-filled sequels and prequels to cash in on popular franchises with no regard for things fans of those franchises usually care about like established canon and lore, so seeing a film like Spider-Man: No Way Home actively put effort into mending the fractured continuity of Spider-Man on the big screen is a refreshingly rewarding thing to see. It helps that it feels like a great way to wrap the previous stories up as well.",ri7eum

Most of the time when you get one of these sort of events we'd have maybe got one other Spider-Man or a couple of extra villains but Marvel went all out for this one. 

I defiently feel we got the right balance of Holland's Spidey and the classics. Got just enough of Maguire and Garfield to satisfy without overshadowing the current Spider-Man.

I was at one pointing rolling my eyes at the spell to make everyone forget Peter Parker because, at first, I thought it meant EVERYTHING from the MCU related to Spider-Man was going to be forgotten but I was OK once it revealed that people remember the hero just not who it was.

It also pretty much fixes the biggest problem I had with the MCU Spidey in that he had so much resources at his disposal. I've always liked in the comics how he would be forced to whip up a solution on a budget (so to speak).

I think some people here however are getting a bit of a mixed message from what the memory wipe means. 

I don't think it was done so Sony has a clean slate for a reboot because if they do one it would have been from scratch anyway. If I was to hedge bets I'd say Holland won't return for the role if it's not an MCU film (I could be wrong but I think he is established now that he can easily get other big roles). I think it was more done for the MCU's benefit if an agreement over the character can't be reached.

The Venom cameo at the end feels like a plot thread to develop if there are further MCU adventures for Spider-Man. Whether that be a run in the black suit or other symbiote based stories who knows?

This was‚Ä¶ fine. It felt mostly that the great moments were fan service, which is fine. And serving as a reset for the character, also fine. But as a movie, it was just ‚Äòmeh.‚Äô It felt VERY stretched out. Maybe it‚Äôs just that after so many years, I‚Äôm kinda done with movies that exist to setup the next one.

William DaFoe and Molina brought back memories for me too. I cried multiple times in the movie. I liked the reprisal of all the villains.

howhoqi,"Now that I've had a bit more time to digest 'No Way Home', my feelings of love for this film are still just as strong haha. 

The biggest strength of this film is that despite all the multiverse, magic and nostalgia, the heart of the movie is still all about Peter Parker & Spider-man. Its an incredible Spider-man story. 

He wouldn't let his villains be sent of to their deaths, he even tussles with Dr Strange in the freaking mirror dimension to help them out. 

I loved the 2 parts of this movie where first its Tom Holland Peter (who's excellent) interacting with all the old villains we know, then the second part where he's interacting with the other Peter Parkers we know. 

The fact he got along with the villains to the point where he's doing science experiments to help them and its all going well until that incredible scene of Peter and his Spider sense freaking out. Honestly that's a top tier Superhero movie moment, Spider-man walking into a room full of his villains with his spidey sense going haywire trying to figure out who's the danger. 

Of course it's Green Goblin, who is such a terrifying villain. Willem Dafoe came back with a bang, Goblin only needed 1 speech to convince the other villains to be selfish and look out for themselves. The fight scenes between Peter 1 and Green Goblin are the most intense and brutal you'll see in a Spider-man film. The first fight where Peter's punching him in the face over and over and Goblins just laughing maniacally before kicking Peter's butt. 

A lot of people complained about MCU Spider-man never having Uncle Ben's death, but they've done their own even better version of that with Aunt May's death. Let's face it Marisa Tomei had very little impact in the first two movies, but she's a far more influential character in NWH. She's Peter's moral compass and role model, teaching him to always help people no matter what, because with great power, comes great responsibility. Her death scene was more tragic than any of Uncle Ben's, Marisa and Tom performed it so brilliantly, she tried to be strong for Peter all the way until the end.

That's also classic Peter Parker, he ends up getting the people he loves most hurt when trying to do the right thing. I could talk about literally 100 more incredible things from this phenomenonal movie but to finish off talking about the Peter 1 - Green Goblin story, at the end when Peter's full of rage and wants to kill Goblin for revenge it was so great that Tobey stopped Peter from doing so. 

Tobey was the one that had bloodlust going for Uncle Ben's killer, both in Spider-man 1 and 3, he saved Tom from making a mistake he'd regret for the rest of his life. Also the fact Tobey saves Norman Osborn from being impaled by his own glider is another nice nod to Spider-man 1. 

**I love this movie so much**, I wrote an essay just on a single part of it. I could go on about how great Garfield was, how the whole scene of him saving MJ was incredibly acted, the emotions running through his face as he thought of gwen and found some redemption saving MJ. I could talk about how great all the villains got along with one another, how well all the nostalgia and references were handled and you could tell this movie was made by and for people who love Spider-man. I could talk about how great the chemistry was between the 3 Peter Parkers and how they instantly got on like brothers. 

This movie is already one of, if not my favourite movie of all time. The atmosphere I had watching this in the cinema was the best I've ever experienced, thank you Marvel and Sony for making a truly incredible and special film. I love Spider-man No Way Home!",ri7eum
howo70o,"Andrew Garfield was so good in this movie that it makes me appreciate TASM 1&2 that much more. I‚Äôm so glad that both of them weren‚Äôt reduced to cameos or schlocky one liners but had real impact to the story and were able to meaningfully guide and mentor MCU Peter on a level with Iron Man. I still can‚Äôt get over how awesome the whole movie was. Charlie Coxs return as DD even if just for a moment was amazing, seeing him catch that brick was just so validating like he was taking a page right from a Cheadle‚Äôs book and saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here deal with it‚Äù. I could go on all day but I‚Äôm so glad I got to see it without spoilers and wish I could erase my own memory and watch it for the first time again.",ri7eum
howyoeh,"The Web Shooter scene is a def highlight for me, I was waiting on my ass on the seat for them to bring it up and man they delivered on that, they are just weirded out by it.

Also, Weirdly enough the scene that shocked me the most is Aunt May's death, it was so sudden, after she delivered the ""With great power comes great responsibility line"" I was like ""no, NO!!!""",ri7eum
hox0gon,"I saw it last night and honestly still think I'm processing what I saw lol. It felt like a fever dream of a movie in the best way possible. 

I honestly had to take a step back and process what I was seeing at points. It was surreal to see Alfred Molina back as Doc Ock, Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin (best of them all imo), Jamie as Electro, etc.

And then when Tobey and Andrew arrived I just about lost my mind. They did right by both of them (MY BACK!, allowing Andrew to save MJ and completing his arc.)

All in all it was a beautiful film and a real celebration of Spider-Man. It honored the previous franchise's stories and brought closure to a lot of arcs from them.

9/10, can't recommend this film enough.",ri7eum
hox0igg,Tom's Peter Parker beating the shit out of goblin and  maguire diving in front and holding him back at the end was one of the best scenes bc you could tell they didn't want Tom to become bitter and an actual murderer.,ri7eum

Jonah Jameson from his universe, and I was also hoping that when Home Peter mentioned his ""tingle"" that the other 2 Spider-Men would tell him to call it Spider Sense so he finally stops calling it his ""tingle"" lol.

EDIT: Also it would have been cool and hilarious if they made a reference to the Spider-Men meme of them all pointing at each other, but that would have just been an unnecessary cherry on top. I guess the scene where they didn't know which Peter Ned was speaking to was basically that but out of costume.",ri7eum

Garfield has proven yet again that he's the best Peter Parker AND Spider-Man.

That Spidey #3 - MJ scene... Boy the feelings... Would probably make me cry if they showed a quick snippet from Gwen's death or something. It was so devastating already for such a short and lowkey scene.

The guy just oozes so much charisma and when he rescued MJ and got teary-eyed, just...wow.

And I'm excited to see where it goes. Peter being college aged like in the Raimi movies and I'm glad people don't know his secret identity anymore since it's such a huge part of his character.

But one smaller MCU thing that does annoy me is the inconsistent potency of Strange's powers. I've seen him teleport and use telekinesis but then he'll still try to grab things or fly. He must know millions of spells at this point but he sticks to his spark whips and Inception-dimension.

As someone who grew up with Tobey Maguire as my Spider-Man, I feel like he got the ending we all deserved and wanted for that Spider-Man.

Suddenly there‚Äôs an appetite for more of Andrew Garfield‚Äôs Spider-Man.  Between Eddie Brock saying he was going to New York, and ASM Parker talking about how he doesn‚Äôt hold back his punches and the scene with MJ.  There‚Äôs more of his story that should be told.",ri7eum

Sure there's things to critique, especially in regard to Steven's actions, but it's a superhero movie, at the end of the day, I'd expect it to be silly to an extent. What I loved about it was how it ties up the entire Spider-Man cinema experience of the last 20 years. I grew up with the Maguire Spidey but missed a lot of the emotional notes as a kid, felt shortchanged by the Garfield series and enjoyed the Holland movies as popcorn flicks, but I absolutely adore the tribute this movie pays to all three franchises. That look on Garfield's face when he catches MJ was just really heartwarming, as was Maguire stopping Holland in his rage. And the ending, even though very predictable, rounds out Holland's Spider-Man pretty well imo. I didn't enjoy all the high tech gadgets and resources his Spider-Man started out with, so the return to the friendly neighborhood Spidey after having met the other two felt quite cathartic.",ri7eum

The ending surprised me and felt out of place, I was expecting a happy ending and for at least MJ and Peter's friend to remember him, so he wouldn't be completely alone.

1. Is there any real proof that Spider-Man is Peter Parker more than Mysterio saying it? Peter only had to deny it, or am I missing something? Actually, I did miss the first ten minutes of the film, so maybe that's it.

2. So, was it really a big deal that those who knew Spiderman was Peter Parker forgot it? He only had to tell them again. No, let's mess with the spell they told me not to mess with.

3. The ""great responsability""'s concept. So you have to save those villiains but you can endanger the whole universe while doing it?

4. As for how the spells work I don't wanna to have a headache, but why couldn't they do the original spell or, in the worst case, make everybody forget Spider-Man instead of Peter Parker? Among other things.

Very good acting from all the main cast. The film was surprisingly heartfelt and I though that every emotional beat hit perfectly. 

It kinda makes me want to see more of the 3 Spidey's together. It definitely makes me want to see more of Maguire's Spidey and even Garfield's Spidey, even though I wasn't hot on those films at the time.

i1pedoj,"I'm pretty late to the party but I wanted to put a few comments down here anyway.

So they cured all the bad guys, great. But then they still sent them back to their timeline where they are dead...So why bother curing them and sending them back if they are already dead? Maybe cure Sandman since he was still alive. Still very cool that they brought back all the original characters and the actors from the Sony Spider-man movies, I thought that was a genius move. I loved watching them all interact and ask questions, like how Tobey made his webs using his body while the others had to make their own spider webs.

It was funny how the baddies were discussing how they got their powers, ""I fell into a vat of electric eels. "" ""I fell into a particle reactor"". ""damn we gotta start watching out where we fall.""

I thought Garfield's 2nd spiderman movie was not very good, but I did like how he portrayed spiderman in the first Amazing Spider Man movie. Tobey McGuire looked a lot older than I thought. I was thinking maybe they should deage him a bit.

I think things are getting a bit out of control with the whole multiverse concept is is breaking too many rules, I love Doctor Strange's character though and his powers seem the coolest of all super heroes. But when the sky was opening up and legions of baddies were slipping into their world I thought that meant certain death for everyone but for some reason when Tom Holland mentions the original spell of people forgetting him, Strange was acting like it was a hard choice....like he had no problem sending people back to die, I forgot the quote but sacrificing the lives of a few to save billions, but when Peter wanted everyone to forget his indemnity Strange was hesitant, like ""hmm but Peter, everyone will forget your name"" (Legions of bad guys slipping through to destroy the world) Strange: ""and they won't remember you!"" Seems like a pretty simple choice and one I thought strange would have done on his own before Peter even mentioned it. 

Also I would really like to see a DC cinematic universe. Could you imagine all the Batmans showing up in the same room.  Like 10 or however many they are, they would have to CGI some of the one who passed away. But that would be something to see.

Oh and how did they just whip up cures for all the villain's in a couple of hours? They were able to do some brain surgery shit with doc oct, an iron man chest thing for electro, some random blast that turns sand monsters into humans. and I'm not sure of the backstory for Green Goblin because it's been a while since I've seen that Spider-Man movie but does he have schizophrenia? They just cured that in a night along with all the other stuff too? To be fair though one of them did have a lab coat on, that shows they were doing some serious science stuff.",ri7eum

how3f3p,"There is just so much. I loved this movie, even if it ripped my heart out several times. That said, for a sillier take, it's like someone pitched a Spider-Man movie and said

""oh sorry, I meant ALL of it. Not just MCU, but Tobey and Andrew movies also.""  
""ok, let's do that.""

Very excited for what the next trilogy looks like.",ri7eum
how3fkg,"Loved the movie. The best Spider-Man and Marvel movie in a long time for me.  

One thing bugging me though is the spell Dr. Strange cast pulled in people who know Spider-Man is Peter Parker.  

Why was Venom pulled in and then sent back by the spell?

He didn't even know what a Spider-Man was or who Peter Parker was.  The symbiote seems to maybe recognize him in the end credits scene in Venom 2 but that could also be the shock of seeing a superhero like Venom.  

I like the setup of the symbiote possibly making its way to New York to bond with Peter. I'm just confused about Tom Hardy's Venom being there at all.",ri7eum

Also with the limited time they had a little arc with Andrew too, when he got there he wasn't in the best place and he had a little connection with his ""brothers""  and got some human contact which you can tell he hasn't had much of since he's Spider-Man all the time in his universe and you can tell being with them really helped him in the end, that I love you guys comment from him they put in as a joke but the way it was delivered was so genuine",ri7eum

However in the trailer at the end of the movie, the multiverse starts interfering with the real world, and Strange Supreme is introduced as a surprise villain as if we are not supposed to know who he is. Also it seems as if we are supposed to forget the fact that Strange Supreme is stuck in the multiverse containing Ultron & Killmonger. So I am wondering does this mean ""What If...?"" is not canon? Is this a new Doctor Strange separate from the one in the multiverse? What's going on?",ri7eum

It wasn't black and while but otherwise it was great. Some jokes were corny or too childish and sometimes the dialogue goes too weird with jewels like ""scooby doo this""

Beside from that it's a good story. If you like the current spider man movie this is a good option and the mid credits scene is a new possibility for a better story based on the characters shown there.",ri7eum

The movie had so much going on but never felt overstuffed. So many things included to make me excited for what‚Äôs to come in the MCU! Garfield reminded me why he is one of the best to ever put on the Spidey suit. Tom‚Äôs best overall acting performance by far. Happy Tobey wasn‚Äôt used as a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too old for this shit‚Äù mentor. Both Garfield and Tobey got heavy redemption and closure from their own series. 

Just a fantastic film. I‚Äôve been saying this all over too, but I am even more confident in Watts‚Äô handling of the Fantastic 4 now.",ri7eum

No lie, I seriously almost cried my eyes out like instantly on the spot when Andrew save MJ and ask if she was okay and his face‚Ä¶. His sad face!!! I was not expecting that or expecting how hard that would hit. My eyes were so water I can barely see the screen! Hands down best spiderman ever all the reference see my entire childhood, teenage moments, and my current adult self all come together in way no movie has ever blew my away. Just because of how emotional special it was it my seriously be the best movie ever for me, cause again I grew up with all these movies.",ri7eum

 Strange vs Spidey fight and Peter finally cracking it was all math.

Spidey sense and revelation of Green Goblin as the main villain.

Freaking Tobey and Andrew showing up and just seeing 3 spiderman for the rest of the movie. It was just like a dream.
 
Last but not the least - Tom Holland killed it as Spidey and Peter. What a performance man.",ri7eum

hoyiwsi,I legit would have been too fucking depressed to keep fighting crime as Spiderman after that ending.,ri7eum
hoyk5n6,"I went in as someone who didn't really like Tom's Spidey. Not really through fault of his own, he is a great actor, just that the writers in the last two movies didn't seem to understand what makes the character so relatable. But this time they nailed for 3 different Spider-Men while still making them all feel unique. I also liked that they really put an emphasis on using their brains to defeat the villains more than anything else, something we saw a little of in TASM series but not quite to this level.

Willem Dafoe honestly was even better in this movie than the original. His motivation was much clearer and truer to character, and actually managed to kill someone important. He also got the best fight scenes in the movie, glad we FINALLY got some good action sequences for MCU Spider-Man. The first fight with Electro was pretty cool as well, Jamie Foxx did a great job and was probably my second favorite villain in this one. That being said, I was a bit let down that Doc Ock got ""fixed"" so quickly. His first fight scene on the bridge was also nothing special. Sandman was just a sandstorm for pretty much the whole time and his motivation made no sense. Lizard was kind of just there. I think they could have cut down on some of the exposition in favor of more drawn-out and creative action scenes, something that has been an issue with MCU spider man in every movie so far.

The move was covered head to toe in cheesy plot armor, but I'm not really sure if it was avoidable with this premise. I honestly kinda like it on some level. It is a comic book movie after all, and I wish more comic movies leaned into the cheesy nature of the source material. It was a bit much though, to the point where a few things just don't make sense at all. My only really major gripes though are that all villains were ""cured"" in the end, and they missed an easy opportunity for Sinister Six, but maybe they are saving that one for later. At least Goblin and possibly Electro should have been irredeemable though.

But they gave my boy Andrew his due respect and I couldn't have asked for much more. He stole the screen every time he was on it. Glad we got some closure for him, but I hope he comes back! He fits more with the sonyverse in my opinion, and I kind of want Tom to have his own stories at this point rather than being so intertwined with the MCU. He is set up perfectly for it with that fantastic ending, and I am honestly excited to see where he goes next. He finally feels like classic Spider-Man now and the new suit looks great.",ri7eum
hoyku7o,"Lol Thomas Haden Church must‚Äôve only been available for voiceover because his footage in ‚Äúhuman‚Äù form was straight from Spider-Man 3.

Biggest Likes:

- May has more of a purpose in this episode

- Doc Ock turning good

- Daredevil cameo was nice

- The scientist line got a chuckle out of me

- Organic Webbing got a chuckle out of me

- Garfield's scene where he saved MJ was heartwarming


Biggest gripes:

- With all his tech, Peter apparently can't do anything to a weaponless Norman?

- Peter than remembered how to use his power and beats the shot out of Norman, no problem. Tobey at least had the excuse of managing the hostages, then getting thrown to a building, before having a bomb to the face

- Peter inviting Electro in as he brags that he's more than willing to murder him, is the biggest threat to him, 

- Think Wong should have had some impact, especially with the point of Wong not finding out being raised

- Sandman has no real substance here. He has no real stake since he doesn't die, wanting them to be cured quickly so he can return to his world. But then in the big fight he seems to have little to do with getting the box and seems to give up on beating Electro like he was seemingly doing. Maybe he should have gone for the kids instead of Lizard, or suggest bringing Strange back. Having him in the big fight scene in the way he was felt lazy.

Biggest Questions:

hozdr8u,"If all the cured villains return to their respective timelines and manage to survive, this then creates 5 different Spider-Man variants... neither of which are the two older 2021 versions of the men we saw in this movie.
Working backwards:

* **Garfield 2014 variant:**  Electro comes back cured and we prevent the end of that movie.  Peter and Gwen still mourn the death of Captain Stacy, but Gwen survives and they make it work with that pain hovering over them throughout their entire relationship.  

* **Garfield 2012 variant:** Lizard comes back cured.  Captain Stacy lives.  Maybe Electro never happens, because a cured Curt Connors gives Peter a heads up.  Captain Stacy might reluctantly come around on Peter dating his daughter and the two of them live happily ever after with dad's approval.

* **Tobey 2007 variant:**  Cured Sandman returns.  Not a whole lot different really since Sandman being cured isn't majorly impactful

* **Tobey 2004 variant:** Cured Otto Octavius returns, but Norman is still dead.  Harry still goes down a path of darkness.  A newly sane Doc Oc comes to his senses, maybe survives and becomes a mentor to Peter.  His own Tony Stark, perhaps.  

* **Tobey 2002 variant:**  A cured Norman Osborn returns, comes to his senses and doesn't die.  He informs Peter of Doc Oc's fate and they work to prevent it.   Harry doesn't turn to the dark side.   This Tobey has a dramatically different path moving forward.  Perhaps the sane version of Norman dedicates the rest of his career to tapping into multi-dimensional portals for profit and enlists the help of Octavius (who never goes insane) and Peter.  Or perhaps, after having glimpsed the highly advanced Stark tech of Holland's 2021, Norman borrows concepts for revolutionary inventions and maybe even becomes the Iron-Man of his universe.   Will Sony lend this premise to an episode of ""What if:  Goblin returns from the multiverse a cured man""... cuz that's an interesting one.

If alternatively, all the villains jump to the 2021 versions of their timelines (since that's where old Tobey and Garfield came from), then they'd have to explain to the world why these men return after being dead for 10-20 years.  That's a very long time to blip.",ri7eum

* Doctor Stranges spell at the end doesn't make sense - if everyone in the multiverse forgets who Peter Parker is then surely that also applied to Maguire and Garfields versions.

-him not taking one second to explain to peter what the spell did before starting it was kind of sus? Seems like a 2 second conversation before altering reality would've solved the plot

-100 opportunities to send everyone home with stranges box. Aunt mays help everyone philosophy was taken to such an extreme it became kind of a meme; leave the few guys who tried to kill you to their fate, which may or may not be bad, or gamble the literal universe on helping them

-if strange only wiped memories, what happens to the hours of footage and media about parker being spiderman? Seems like he has enough proof of who he is?

-if strange can undo all the footage and hard evidence of peter being spiderman, then hes effectively undoing time, across infinite universes, and is stronger than time stone by himself?

-spiderman still exists, people just dont know about parker Which means every other movie happened without avengers or nick fury bothering to learn spidermane identity, which seems out of character

The original spell was make everyone forget spiderman is Peter, not forget that Peter exists. To undo the mistake, why did people need to forget about peter, and not just that peter = spiderman? They kinda retconned the premis of the spell within its own movie.

Spiderman memories and peter memories should exist independently, from my understanding

Thats off the top of my head, idk.

The movie was really cool to watch and felt good if i ignored everything else that the mcu built up, but the plotholes are tripping me

It also doesn't feel good that everything ended off net worse than it started. Which is fine from a writing standpoint, not every story needs to be a victory. Just, we traded 2 college admissions for the entire history of Peter Parker, aunt mays death, and a lot of destruction. I feel like everyone would be better off if this movie just didn't happen and the main cast waited for the bad pr to die down and re applied to uni

I was very confused about Tobeys words when he first appeared. Maybe I missed something but he comes out of the portal and MJ looks at him confused. ""Your Peter!?"" Tobey agree's then says ""I've seen you two..."" then looks at Andrew Garfield and says ""Wait... he's not your friend"". How did he ever see them before and how does he know Andrew isn't their friend? This really confused me! Also confused how Jameson can be in this world and tobeys world? There's 2? Or is that just supposed to be one of those things you aren't really supposed to think about.

hp40t81,"Okay so let‚Äôs get down to the bidness‚Ä¶

The future of the MCU Spider-Man.

1. Venom: Who does he attach to on earth 616? Is there another Eddie Brock? 

2. How does this spell work with the Avengers?
The conversation with Happy at the cemetery confirms that the Avengers know that Spidey exists still. But how could they possibly contact Spider-Man in the future if they don‚Äôt know he‚Äôs Peter Parker?

3. The REAL Sinister Six: Kraven, Rhino, Black Cat, Venom, Morbius, and Kingpin? Cat, Rhino and Kraven made appearances in the multiverse rift during the climax of the film, could that be a tease to the Sony films building a sinister six? Could Andrew Garfield come back for this film? 

4. DareDevil. Can we expect to see Matt Murdock in a Disney+ show to pick up where his Netflix journey left off or is it time that he makes his jump to the big screen? OR‚Ä¶ does he do both? Spidey Team up? Team Red? What does this mean for the rest of the marvel Netflix properties? I.e. The Punisher, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage. Which brings me to my next point.

5. My last and favorite point: Miles Morales debut to the MCU. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre from Queens and help the poor people. There‚Äôs gotta be a black Spider-Man out there somewhere..‚Äù - Electro 

Now this is where shit gets deep‚Ä¶.

Homecoming introduced Aaron Davis aka Prowler aka Mile Morales‚Äô Uncle. This fact and Electro‚Äôs quip alone confirms that Miles does exist in the MCU already. However he‚Äôs not at yet been bitten by the spider. 

Or has he? What if(no pun intended), the animated Miles Morales; who‚Äôs 2nd film is coming soon, is the MCU Spider-Man. But the studio is still looking for an actor? This is purely fan speculation based on no real facts but it would be awesome to see miles story go from animation to live action being as though he‚Äôs already dealing with the multiverse is his realm. 

More than likely we will see Tom Holland grow for three more solo films where he meets a young Miles who later gets bitten in a post credits scene. Leading to Peter mentoring Miles for a few films before Tom hangs up the mask.

hp4ltxk,"This was a fantastic movie, but here a few things I noticed. 

For obvious reasons the movie didn't have time to explore the characters and universe  that Holland set up in his previous two movies, but they did a good job with the alloted time that they had.

Also, I do feel like the movie felt a little rushed in places given that they had so much to do. One example is the death of Aunt May, I didn't really feel it like I did other deaths in the MCU. I don't know if it was Holland's acting in the scene or what, but I was left a little underwhelmed.

Alfred Molina was fantastic and gave one hell of a performance considering this was just a payday for him.  Defoe and Jamie Foxx also gave great performances. I can sympathize with Max Dillon for wanting to stay in this universe, he's way more handsome, confident and far stronger. Also, call me crazy, but I think they toned down the Goblin in this movie a bit, but I wonder if that's just a product of time constraints.

# HOWEVER ,

(FULL OF SPOILERS BELOW)

I would love to get some affirmation about my confusion around two parts of the movie:

1. **Villains and Spideys going back to their universes**
   1. How does this work since all the villains (I'm assuming) are going back to the point they were plucked, which was seconds from their untimely demise... are they going back without their powers and just looking to resolve their differences with the spideys at that moment?
   2. What about the spideys? Do they go back remembering what happened in MCU's T.Holland's world or do they forget too with Dr.Strange's spell? Do they know what happened to the villains since they ""cured"" them?
   3. Does this cause a rift/new timeline in the multi-verse like TVA or The Ancient One discussed with the stones? Or do the plot's of those previous spider movies just end with a happy conclusion of villains hanging up their evilness and doing better?
2. **Spider-man ‚â† Peter Parker**
   1. How does Happy know Aunt May now if Peter ""doesn't exist""? I mean I guess they could have just met on the streets or a dating app? But if Peter doesn't tie them together then how would Happy have a connection with May?
   2. Infinity War and Endgame still happened and Spider-man exists but none of the Avengers know who spiderman was throughout their whole epic adventure through? Did Tony not hold onto a dissipating Peter Parker or Spiderman on Titan?
   3. Can't Tom Holland just spider and web around to the Avengers to at least get them to remember their time together? At least to Dr.Strange since Strange would probably be the one most capable of understanding T.Holland's situation??

Sorry for the rant but just wanted to see if anyone felt the same about these pieces of the movie...

hp5fo9c,"All of the expository dialog in this killed me a bit. I generally find Marvel films to be quite believable on that front and this felt like a Star Wars prequel. ‚ÄúHey, remember when..?‚Äù kinda shit all over the place. Tbh I really don‚Äôt think Marvel should go out of their way to inform audiences because I really don‚Äôt think those that aren‚Äôt informed about the overarching plot really care all that much about missing a couple references.

Also, Strange‚Äôs characterization felt off.

Despite these gripes, I still found the movie super enjoyable. Probably my least favorite of the Holland films but that‚Äôs not much of a detractor because the prior two were absolutely stellar imo.",ri7eum

Goblin was so effing menacing in this. Dafoe nailed it. Ock has always been my favorite marvel movie villain, but damn if Goblin didn‚Äôt give him a run for his money here. The cloak look he ended with was a fantastic redesign and I wish it featured more.

It doesn‚Äôt feel like 20 years passed with Ock. Molina was right back to it. His performance and Ock‚Äôs story here were great. His redemption and remeeting with Toby made my day.

The others were alright. Electro looked so much better here than how he did before.

Everything about the other two spidey‚Äôs was great. Everything. Seeing how each of the previous spideys were getting along post series, and the redemption and closure they got on this made me tear up (like a lot of scenes. Don‚Äôt think I have ever teared up so much in a movie). I definitely needed more of that banter and talking shop.

That final fight is up there with Endgame‚Äôs IMO. The final standoff between Tom and Goblin was great punctuated by Tobey jumping in to stop Tom from making a horrible mistake. 

I hate how  Spidey ended up. Alone with no support anymore (as Peter at least) but living up to the classic great power mantra. But that‚Äôs how things always seem to go for Spidey eventually. He‚Äôll bounce back and I hope to be there to see it.

Honestly, I think this is my favorite of the new trilogy. Peter actually makes difficult choices which have significant emotional weight, whereas the other two movies didn't feel like he had significant choices (sure he has to give up on Liz but that never felts as powerful as a Spidey hardship should feel). Hopefully the next Spider-Man keeps up the theme of sacrifice and shows how difficult being Spider-Man is.

hpl14un,"Finally got to see the movie, and I was blown away with how they approached this nostalgic crossover of a movie. Tom Holland is still great as both Peter and Spider-Man, and I think they found a way to make a plot that's based on the history of the movies without being too overindulgent on the nostalgia alone. The action scenes were great, especially the fight with Strange and the hand-to-hand fights.

Also, I think this just goes to show how some of the roles in the history of the Spider-Man movies were perfectly cast. Alfred Molina still perfectly played his part with a commanding performance as a mad doctor and the ""reasonable"" one of the villains. Jamie Foxx showed that he can play a great Electro when he's allowed to basically play himself. And of course Willem DaFoe played Osborne and the Goblin even better than he did 20 years ago.

But the one I think who stole the show was Andrew Garfield. He seemed genuinely delighted to be playing Spider-Man again, and it went to show how his movies weren't bad because of him. He found a way to balance be a well-rounded character as both Peter *and* Spider-Man, and was believable as both.

I thought this was a great crossover movie, as well as a great way to put Holland's version of Spider-Man ""on ice"" as it were. I'm sure he'll make at least one more appearance, but this was a good note for him to end on.",ri7eum

The final fight felt a bit messy to me in comparison.

1) How did they get all the villains out of their prisons and into Happy's apartment if Strange was lost in the Grand Canyon or whatever? I thought Strange was the only one who could get in and out (as established earlier on)

2) Why would you brainwash the entire world into not knowing who Peter Parker is, but knowing Spider-Man exists? Couldn't you just brainwash away that people know they're the same person? That way Peter gets to keep his normal life and you tie the end to the very beginning of the movie.

3) Related to #2, why wouldn't Peter give Ned and MJ some proof of their friendship like taking a selfie, a necklace, something physical that he can show them after he's forgotten?

\>he went home and the MIT thing happened. he realized he had affected his friends lives because he is spiderman.he talked to aunt may and aunt may delivered the""great power line"" where sometimes he has to sacrifice for others and she would not want to forget about him but if he thinks it is the right choice she will support him.

\> the universe starts cracking and something is happening

\>other villians start showing out of no where and attacking people.

\>dr strange said something is happening and the other people from other universes are coming to their universe. (can maybe blame on loki)

\>Since spiderman identity was on the top news, villains that recognize spiderman went to specifically find him.(other villains and people appear too but the movie would not go over them, they can either choose to ignore or make other movies about it)

\>Spiderman went to talk to Dr strange about the forget spell but Dr strange talks about the multiverse (that it is emergency) and does not know why is this occuring but their universe is cracking and while he is fixing it he needs spiderman to help him stop the villains(other heroes are stopping other villains too)

\> Spiderman saw Electro and some other villains and tried to fight them but he was overwhelmed. Electro took his suit power source(spiderman suit) to get the power up.

\>He went back home while hurt to rest but when he went back home he saw green goblin with aunt may(he didn't know he is a villain). GreenGoblin specifically finds her because he asked around and realized she is an acquaintance to Spiderman.

\>they talked and chatted while peter recovers and green goblin asks him if he is spiderman. Suddenly his spidysense heighten(like the movie) he was confused and look around until he sees green goblin(he knew instantly)

\>As he laughs his glider flew towards peter pushing him away while he is hurt. He and greengoblin had the fight like the movie and then the explosion happens and aunt may died.

\>same thing happened in the movie spiderman announce that he will meet the villians at the statue of liberty. Peter friends are there to talk to him and he told them to leave him alone.(he is depress and just want to get this over with)

\>The villian appear and spiderman was ready to fight them alone. AS he fights and losing the other spiderman appears and start helping him.

\>They fought and MJ saving scene and Tobey stopping tom to kill green goblin also occur. they immobilize(hurt) the villains and at the final moment they realized they are disappearing.

\>Holland realized Dr strange finally did it. Some days later after he talked to MJ and best friends telling them goodbye and everything else.

\>He went to strange and tells him to do the spell. Dr strange respect him and gives him a good luck. Then the ending scene is the same with visiting his friends and checking on them while they not knowing him.

You gotta forgive the plot for being stupid sometimes (the way Dr. Strange screws up his spell, the ""selectiveness"" with each character that reaches the MCU). The joke every 3 minutes in the dialogues was truly annoying this time.



It kinda feels like cheating that Holland's Spidey needs villains from previous unrelated films to grow as a character.





It puts into perspective how good is Into the Spiderverse for introducing other Spider-Men that part of the audience may not know about. No Way Home just assumes (with good reason) that we all know who is everyone that's unrelated to the MCU but it feels lazy not actually showing you who each character is, what kind of villain or hero they are, they just say it to you.

He's a completely different character now, if a character at all. And once again marvel does a third act battle with a mud brown palette and a default backdrop. May's death was further than I thought they'd take it so that was cool but even that scene was ugly to look at. I do give a lot of props to where they leave Peter off. He's lost everyone, has no resources, and is settling for a GED. he's finally in the gutter, it feels way better than a tech bro with stark connections.",ri7eum

howahrw,"This movie was not that great. There were some parts that were cool that if the movie goers didn't fucking shout and cheer, would have been a lot better to experience. I liked that they capitalized on their multiverse idea by bringing back Garfield and Maguire. Tom Holland was easily the weakest Spiderman and it really showed next to the other two. Aunt May was a complete idiot for the sake of plot, solely and it made the movie kind of stupid at times. It feels like I'm being told that Peter and MJ are in love and dating, but the two have next to no chemistry. We're told that Ned is a best friend character, but he also has no chemistry with Holland's Spiderman. Ned simply feels there to be the butt of jokes and say/do stupid punchlines. 

It was a cool idea to bring back the old villains, but they felt rushed and misused. Max's character looked better, but acted completely out of character. At one point he mentioned how he's not listening to someone dressed like a DnD character..  like Max is supposed to be some super nerdy dude, why would this make sense as a diss coming from him? Nope, just more forced Marvel humor. 

Speaking of forced Marvel humor, this movie was littered with it and it sucked. Some Marvel movies I can at least laugh at a couple jokes, but all of these were stupid. ""Fresh water or Salt Water""... Everyone died of laughter because of this line, but it literally makes no sense... He's a fucking human and looks completely human... Maybe if this was the shark character from Suicide Squad this joke would make sense, but just because his name was Doctor Octopus does not mean this joke made sense.... Hell they didn't even refer to him as Doctor Octopus, they called him Doctor Octavius. How does this joke make sense? How does Aunt May make an Octopus joke here??? It's forced and lame. 

There's also so many moments of emotional clashing that pissed me off. One in particular was the moment where Tobey was talking about Harry dying in his arms, which could have segued into a nice little emotional call back, but was instead interrupted by a stupid bit with ""butt of the joke"" Ned turning into a villain and getting killed by Peter. Good job Marvel, way to kill your emotional tone. 

Every five minutes they feel the need to force humor down your throat and it's mainly some dumb quip that isn't that funny.

Willem Dafoe was good, but underutilized. Doctor Connor was barely used... Why have him? Same as Marco Flynn, why have him other than appeasing the fan base? Stupid. Doc Oc was good, wish they didn't turn him into a bitch halfway through the movie. 

It took wayyyy too long for theovie to get going. The first act was a slog of dumb jokes and stupid character decisions. The movie literally points out how stupid it's story is by having Doctor Strange tell Peter to call MIT. Pretty much the whole movie could've been avoided if Peters first thought wasn't... Let's get the whole world to forget Spiderman. Maybe the movie should've been about building back his reputation and proving to the world that he truly is a hero instead of fan service bullshit. That would've been an interesting plot. 

MJ sucks. Absolutely bland and boring character. I wished Andrew Garfield failed to save her, although it was a good little moment that the movie had when he did, whoever made that decision deserves a pat on the back. 

Couple of other gripes I have had to do with Spiderman's powers conveniently turning off' when the movie needs them to or having him be a complete idiot. Peters webs can hold up a car, but he never decides to try and use them to stop Aunt Mays wound from bleeding, nor does he used them to shift the goblins flight machine off course from May. The plot needed May to die because plot reasons so Peter has to be stupid or have his powers no longer apply. 
Tobey gets stabbed by the Green Goblin... What happened to his Spidey senses? And don't tell me they aren't working well because he's old or some shit because Tom Holland's Spidey senses should've alarmed to the fact the the Green Goblin was gonna stab someone based on earlier in the movie when his senses could tell that Norman was shifting personalities. But the plot needs Spiderman to be dumbed down. 

The entire scene after Aunt May dies was tonally idiotic. It made Aunt Mays death seem like an afterthought and a joke. We go from Aunt May dying to endless jokes about making portals and getting spider webs off of ceilings. To make it worse, the next scene is MJ and Ned suddenly acknowledging and caring about the fact that May is dead. RIGHT after we saw her die and then got five minutes of jokes. Way to kill your mood Marvel. 

Speaking of the scene where May dies and the SWAT team is approaching Peter... Why doesn't he use his webs to creating a shield or close off the opening I'm the building? Once again, Spiderman goes stupid for plot reasons. Happy needed to see them in the rubble (which how could he have seen that it was May and not someone else like MJ).

Also, the ending... If Doctor Strange had the power to make the whole world forget about a whole ass person, why couldn't he just.. I dunno.. make the world forget the past week or so instead??? Well of course because we have to set up another sequel... Stupid. Also, when MJ and Ned are on top of the statue of liberty and forget about Peter and what's happened, wouldn't they be like wtf??? Why we up here??? And when Peter swung from the top of the statue, where did his web attach onto? The sky?? A cloud??? (Ok that's just minor gripe but I thought it was strange). 

Overall, the movie was pretty annoying and so was the dumb crowd. Some good ideas, some good, yet underutilized performances. Marvel still not understanding how to convey tone and emotion and injecting shit humor every five minutes. 

I get why people like these movies and I'm glad that a lot of you get to enjoy them, but honestly I don't get the love for these things. Peace.",ri7eum

1.Andrew Garfield‚Äôs redemption in saving MJ was the highlight of the film (Andrew Garfield actually almost stole the entire movie)

2. Alfred Molina/Jamie Foxx/THC/Rhys Ifans were good but Willem Defoe was phenomenal. His take on Green Goblin deserves to be in the pantheon of super villains.

3. Tom Holland‚Äôs Peter Parker finally gets baptized by fire and becomes Spider-‚ÄúMAN.‚Äù RIP Aunt May. What.a.scene.

4. Tobey is the OG and he was treated as such. By far got the most standing ovation in the theatre. Bow down to the man who started it all. Bad back and all.

5. Tom Holland and Zendaya‚Äôs chemistry was off the charts and really helped end the film right. The stakes in this movie felt real. Something lacking in the previous films.

6. Matt Murdoch is a good lawyer

7. Jon Watts is a good director but after 3 movies, he‚Äôs just not that great. 

8. I could watch the 3 Peters talk Spider-Man all day long. The fan service and Easter eggs were incredible. 

9. So Tom Hardy isn‚Äôt in the MCU? Lame

howxssl,"My biggest problem with this movie (aside from Ned being able to open portals in his first try when it took DOCTOR STRANGE a long time to learn) was the CGI. I think it's becoming a big issue in Marvel movies. Anyone else?

From the top of my head here are the scenes that stood out the most:

\- The green goblin alley scene, it looked incredibly flat, everything looked fake, even the brick norman used to crack the mask. I think that the only thing in that scene that was real was Willem's head and it was really obvious.

\- When Andrew's spider-man shows up, his suit is complete CGI, and then when he takes his mask off it's real.

\- The final fight. Andrew's and Tobey's suits could've been done better, looked really flat.

\- The scenes where Lizard and Sandman transform back to human are all taken from other movies, Lizard from Amazing Spider-Man 1 and Sandman from Spider-Man 3. I don't believe either of the actors came back physically for this movie.

\- The final fight between Peter and Norman. That was worse than Black Panther, the green screen was extremely obvious in this and the glider... my god that glider looked horrible when peter was picking it up, looked like a png.

This stuff really gets to me because it shows these people don't really care that much about the finer details of the movie, it feels rushed and it looks bad and while that may not be a big deal to you to me it really can detract from the experience, and please don't say it's because of covid, it's not. Marvel's CGI quality has been on a steady decline since black panther. I guess they just learned people will eat their shit up no matter what so they stopped caring.

I'm not saying I'm not a fan of CGI, all I'm saying is it has to be good and not overused, otherwise the movie ends up looking like a video game. Good CGI is seamless, and this movie had little of it. Props on the Doctor Strange fight, THAT looked great and I wish the whole movie was on that level.",ri7eum

Marvel movies usually rely on a few ""don't-think-about-it-too-much"" events to move the plot along but this was *entirely* cheap contrivance after nonsensical character decision after cheap contrivance all the way, then a big baddie fight. 

By the time the big reveal of the two Spideys came I was already so unimpressed with the scaffolding that got us to them, that their banter came across as crass and fake. I don't think I've ever seen a movie feel so arbitrarily studio-constructed in my life - even the fact that we saw no other Spidey variations or villains at all, no attempt to even imagine content that hasn't already been produced. They did the absolute bare minimum with an incredibly cheap plot. I guess it hit the odd emotional beat, the final choice to have Peter Parker forgotten was interesting, Dafoe was great, but other than that it was extremely mediocre IMO - not quite sure why it has all the praise it does.",ri7eum
how1v0r,"As a huge Spider-Man fan, I really didn't enjoy this as much as I hoped. 
Lots of funny moments, but most of it was literal forced memes based on Spidey. They even did that bit about the bio webshooters everyone has beat to death for years.

Andrew carried the last half of the movie really while Holland cried and Tobey kinda stared off at the stagehand on a greenscreen. 

Plus the ending while poignant is a brutal slap in the face to people who like the MCU, clearly we are getting Sony mandated movies from now on.",ri7eum
hoy6xuf,"This movie sucked ass and I feel like I'm from a different planet or something considering the reception it's currently getting. This movie had no soul.

Scene after scene of lame wisecracks, endless exposition that doesn't end up making the film's events make sense anyways and the characters of Hollandverse Spidey who the movie is supposed to be about are the worst part about it. It takes the majority of the film to get to the previous Spideys and yet somehow still manages to feel rushed because every scene has to break into some comedic bit regardless of how appropriate it is at the time. Time that could have been spent building some actual chemistry between the characters. The whole thing felt like a montage or something?

Like are the villains just chilling for about an hour after Goblin stirs them up? They hit up Starbucks until the script says it's big battle time? Are we even supposed to be intimidated by the villains? Iron Spidey beats Doc Ock's ass instantly, Lizard/Sandman they just didn't even try with them, Electro they retconned to act completely differently than the movie they plucked him from? He gets super juiced up just to...get owned by Doc Ock who got his ass kicked by Spidey (who was struggling with Electro)? Why is Spidey in any universe able to DEFEAT A TIME BENDING WIZARD WHO SQUARED UP WITH THANOS??? Green Goblin was awesome almost entirely because of Dafoe who gave way too good a performance for what this movie's script deserved and what he had to work with. He ofc doesn't get nearly enough screentime. You could tell Molina was trying but the script was just so disrespectful to his character that he couldn't have done much better, same for the Andrew/Tobey Spideys.

I could go on and on so I won't. I appreciate them trying something so ambitious in the first place but this movie really felt like such a mess to me and I was immensely disappointed. I've been enjoying the MCU less and less as the years go by and I think this movie really hit home to me why that is. All the pieces were there for an incredible superhero flick and the producers predictably watered it down into nothing more than nostalgia bait, low brow comedy and product placement. I thought the MCU was going to nail Spidey with the Holland movies but this shit is missing things that even Garfield spiderverse had let alone comparing it to the Raimi trilogy. Then again I was excited for Abrams Star Wars so fool me once Ig...

Anybody else immeasurably disappointed by this movie or it it just me? :(

hp9xeya,"Genuinely one of the worst films I've ever seen. Like, easily the worst I've seen this year or in recent memory. I am baffled at how almost 50% have rated this a 10/10. Full disclosure and to be fair; I have not seen all of the related films that tie in, but based on the criticism I have I don't think it would make any difference. 

The acting and dialogue is utterly woeful and cringe-inducing most of the way through. The story is also completely pointless, random and self-defeating. The forced ""jokes"" are literally painful, the only funny part in the film is Willem Dafoe's grin as Spiderman beats the shit out of him. Cool cameos, cool effects, utter garbage everything else. 

I want to like this, I really do. But I'm just so unbelievably confused. *HOW*?",ri7eum
hqidryq,"I thought it was a 5/10. 

It's a perfect example of all the worst parts of the MCU-- too many meta 4th wall winks to the audience (e.g. ""I'm something of a scientist"", ""power of the sun"", Andrew Garfield saying he sucks, Tobey saying he's AMAZING), too reliant on low hanging fruit fan service (Which Peter are you talking to!?; Do your webs come out of your penis?!), lame ass dad joke quips every other line (""you look like a youth pastor"", laughing at Dr. Octopus's name, etc.), and no emotional sincerity. 

I didn't give a fuck about Aunt May dying. She's been nothing but a MILF joke in the MCU. Now I'm supposed to be sad she's dead? C'mon. Also I hated them turning Tobey talking about Harry dying into a joke. Everything is a joke in the MCU and it's so annoying that there are no genuine moments of gravitas. 

The pacing felt weird, the screenwriters, it seemed, didn't know how to handle all the talent on screen. This movie was like 30-40 mins too long. 

The visual effects (particularly the de-aging) were impressive. 

I liked the scene where Tobey talked to Dr. Octavius at the end. I also thought the joke about Tobey and Andrew not knowing about the avengers was funny-- one of the only jokes that landed for me.

I will say Molina and Dafoe were amazing tho. They're just such great actors and a cut-above everyone else. 

This is practically a sinister six movie and it just felt so fumbled. And so much unnecessary fan service. And so many lame ass fucking jokes. 

The whole point of this movie was to reset Spider-Man within the MCU so they could keep cashing in on him lmao. Such a roundabout way to reset a character. 

Real bummer for me.",ri7eum

She gets suplexed by the glider, blown up by the bomb, the walks around for like 2 minutes and dies in some long drawn out speech that we didn't need to hear (with great power? Didn't need to hear it...). I was the only one laughing in my packed theater.",ri7eum
howzq6k,Is no one gonna talk about the lazy (not to say plain terrible) script and dialogues ? Yeah nostalgia feels good but let's not ignore the overall mediocrity and abysmal artistic merits of this thing,ri7eum
hovi3f8,"Honestly I was really surprised that I liked this one. Fixes the issues with all the other Tom Holland Spidey movies. 

Definitely biased towards the Tobey movies because I grew up with them and though I think Andrew is a great actor (Social Network, Silence) I thought his movies were well - intentioned but were too forced and convoluted. Overall, I used to think Tom Holland was a charming lead but never bought him as Spider - Man and couldn't take his movies seriously

The point of Spider-Man is that he's a regular working class kid struggling to get by and Tobey and Andrew's portrayals seemed to capture that. On the other hand, Tom was handed everything to him and never faced consequences. 

Homecoming: Tom decides to not join the Avengers due to personal responsibility, however, it's obvious he'll join in the next movie so it doesn't mean anything. 

Far From Home: Everyone expects Tom to be the next Iron Man because - why??? He's in high school. Once he has his moment of personal growth, Happy Hogan smiles because Tom just uses Tony's expensive gear and there's no real moment of self - actualization based around sacrifice or defining himself by things other than Iron Man.

No Way Home: while there's alot of stuff that doesn't add up (Stark's 3-d printer that can fix ANYTHING) it totally gets the core concept of Spider-Man. In this version, Peter's friends were his family and making the ultimate sacrifice meant giving them up to serve the greater good. Gone are his fancy gadgets or supersonic jet, and instead we finally end an MCU movie with Peter Parker at a cemetery and see him stitching his own suit. Peter is back in a lonely apartment and struggling with his studies. It's not new material but its the real - world drama the MCU series always lacked. 

Tom was always a likable protagonist but after 5 years, he's finally Spider-Man. If this is the end of his contract, this was a stellar end",ri7eum

hp0lgw7,"This was ABSOLUTING FUCKING AMAZING, Holy fucking shit.

Goblin being the main bad guy again is the best. Dafoe is everything. I liked the more comic-book look they gave him.

When the villains showed up, we all cheered...and we all cheered loudly when Toby and Andrew show up. This real life version of Spider-verse was so awesome. I loved all the bonding scenes and callbacks to the other films. Toby telling Ned his friend became a supervillain, and Ned's reaction is priceless...or when Andrew saves MJ. Was surprised about aunt may, but was a great way to incorporate the Uncle Ben-esque story line.

That mid credits scene! That's got me hyped.",ri7eum
hp0pmgs,"The reaction the audience in my theater had when Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man walked through that portal - I don't think I've experienced anything like that in a movie before. Even during a movie like endgame, I didn't hear roars/applause as audible as this instance tonight. It was like a collective build-up. As soon as the portal opened, you had the handful of people familiar with the suit (eyes much larger) starting to cheer. When he finally pulled his mask off, it was pure jubilation.",ri7eum

hqgremt,"Unfortunately, there is a quite big problem with the movie. I am sorry but I do not think that what I am about to say is even debatable. The prime moving force of the entire movie is an unbelievably stupid and rash mistake made by Dr. Strange, who is supposed to be ""the wisest of them all"". I am sorry, but what the fuck was Strange's movie for, what was his growth out of ego and pushing boundaries for? Do you seriously even begin to attempt to convince me, that after his movie overcoming himself, and literally orchestrating the entire comeback against Thanos in Infinity War and Endgame, he reverts to a complete idiot, even more rash than before his origin story, and casts such a global-scale powerful spell so nonchalant and half-assed, without clarifying ANY (extremely important) details, only to say that it cannot be stopped after it has begun??? You would think fighting Dormamu and Thanos makes you a bit more careful with these kinds of powers. I don't even want to mention that he could hold 4-infinity stone Thanos off on his own for quite a while, but could not subdue Spiderman and even lost to him due to ""math"". On a side note the sorcerer supreme had to almost die on fucking mount Everest to open his first portal, but Ned did it by accident?? This movie makes a complete joke of one of the best and most powerful characters and his development in the MCU with these absolutely uncharacteristic and idiotic actions. As for Spiderman himself, I thought his emotional arc was pretty good, seeing him walking on the thin line between his ideal and his scorching pain. The way the other Spidermen both gave a part of their broken selves to Peter in his lowest point which led to him saving the person who killed his aunt in order to not have May's death be in vain and live her Ideals through him was honestly very well done. I didn't mind the fan service, as I don't think that it was too much or awkwardly placed. Again, the dynamic between the Spidermen was pretty good, and the almost fatherly-like roles they assumed seemed on point. Yet again though, a big part of the ending was non other than Dr. Strange himself. It is as if the movie is really good, until they decide to pop him on the screen just to butcher his character. How did he escape his situation, why would he not get Wong's help if the world is ending, and why wouldn't he make the final spell so everyone except avengers and peter's friends forgot his identity, as in the beginning he said that tampering with the spell mid-cast caused it to break out of control, but this time he knew from the beginning who Peter wanted to remember him (as if he shouldn't have asked the first time) so there would have been no mid-cast tampering with the spell. Honestly the spell itself and its implications were not explained well at all to begin with. I really don't get how demoting spiderman to fight robbers in the neighborhood again after fighting cosmic level threats on other planets alongside the most powerful beings in the MCU is somehow progressive to the character. Overall the movie is fine if you try to ignore the plot (which is quite funny) and there are some genuinely touching moments but if you are looking at it through a more serious lens it is pretty bad. I just hope, this was a one-off for Strange's character and they return him to his old self in Multiverse of Madness.",ri7eum
hqk8f8x,"The movie really got me in the third act with Tobey and Andrew. Beside that - and I know it‚Äòs a big thing for a lot of people - the film is rather mediocre. The first two acts are kind of boring, I don‚Äòt like most of the character decision (Dr. Strange WTF) and even the action scenes were kinda dull. Nothing to really remember.

hovwzt8,"So, this sits around a C+/B- for me. 

Willem Dafoe was phenomenal, and all I want is more of his Green Goblin. The hallway fight with his insane smile as Peter punches him over and over was legit frightening. May's death was extremely unexpected and hit hard. The emotional beats worked well, but the pacing really threw a wrench in the whole thing. Movie started off so fast with the active camera work and jumping right into the story we left off at in FFH, so it all just felt off to me as they sped up and slowed down throughout. 

There were too many instances of ""banter"" going on way longer than they should have. The Spider-Men talk on the scaffolding before the battle was funny in principle, but it went on and on, and I don't need Tobey to tell Garfield he's amazing twelve times. Hit it once, solidly, and let's go. Dialogue got super derailed sometimes with all the in-jokes and references and made some scenes that should have worked otherwise just not work well at all. 

Was very excited to see the Venom mid credits scene, and even more so for Strange 2 trailer at the end. Can't wait to see Raimi do more Marvel.",ri7eum

howej76,"Dont get me wrong, i screamed like a 5 year old the whole movie, but if we're talking honest critique this movie was 90% fanservice  

Tom's spiderman feels very weird in this movie, his emotional voyage feels artificial. He doesnt really do anything heroic, the scene where he almost kills goblin feels like its there just to give tobey his big break. At the end of the movie the villains are sent back wherever they came from so what did removing their powers accomplish? Especially when the real threats to Tobey and Andrew, Venom and Harry's goblin, are absent. 

Too many characters are underused, the rise of the daily bugle was nice but very distant from the actual story.  


If you take away the hype, this movie is another infinity war. A huge cast, with each getting 2 or 3 minutes of screentime. Difference is, there is no thanos this time, dont get me wrong goblin was a great villain but there is no solid main character to drive the plot, as tom lets everyone tell him what to do and makes weak decisions based on selfish feelings throughout the movie.

hp125am,"If this was a DC movie it‚Äôll probably be at 55% on Rotten Tomatoes and would be getting flamed hard all over the Internet. Marvel movies have never been the greatest but even I was shocked at how bad the script of this movie was, like if you remove the nostalgia and fan service bait shit it is horrible. I‚Äôll give an example of one of the gigantic flaws everyone just seems to be ignoring for some reason:

Aside from Willem Dafoes Goblin who‚Äôs crazy, NONE of the other villains had any reason to fight with any of the spideys at the end. Electro and Sandman especially were hilarious, dude said he just wants to get back to his daughter and then started fighting the spideys who were trying to help them get home at the end for literally no fucking reason lmao

In fact, there are several flaws in this movie that previous DC movies like BvS and co have been roasted to all hell for. I really just dislike bias and it‚Äôs ever apparent with these marvel movies.",ri7eum
hp28gij,"I know people are gonna say this is the best MCU movie and I‚Äôll let them have it for now because of all the nostalgia

But this wasn‚Äôt a good movie by any means. This movie highlighted why Holland, imo, is such a bad Spider-Man. I think he gets a pass for being the most believable Spider-Man as far as his appearance and voice but other than that he wasn‚Äôt ever setup to be a great Spider-Man 

The other spidermen that showed up were better in their own stories because of the themes. They were relatable. They experienced loss. They had to learn how to be the hero they needed to be to save the city 

Then you have Holland standing next to them and until that movie he hasn‚Äôt faced any hardship. In the first movie he had Stark + gadgets + resources and he got the most popular girl in the school relatively easy. In the second movie he had another mentor, another very powerful piece of tech, a lavish field trip, and all this other bs

In each movie he looks to give these things up for silly reasons because he internally has no reason to try and quit other than he feels he should. This movie was no different. The reason they opened up the multiverse was because his friends couldn‚Äôt make it into MIT. That was the threat. All other potential threats from DODC didn‚Äôt even stick yet and they were all legal troubles. So his ONLY reason for wanting that spell was so they could go to a school that they only ever wanted to go to because they thought all of them would get in *together*. Does that sound like a good reason to you?

Spider-Man also has this crazy plot armor because he‚Äôs not supposed to experiment unnecessary grief. How the hell does he beat Strange in his own world using math?

This movie has a ton of bs like that where the solution is presented right along with the problem. His friend just suddenly knows how to use Strange‚Äôs magic in the most casual way right when they need Peter?

This movie was great when it was less MCU and more every other universe because imo the other spidey films had to actually be good films, or they had to *try* to be good films. They couldn‚Äôt just stand tall on the strength of superhero movies. Definitely not the first trilogy

But when this movie went into MCU mode is when you start to see all the same issues. You start to realize how much of a product these films are meant to be and how it‚Äôs like seeing action figures in action instead of people in stories

People will love this movie now because it‚Äôs new and that‚Äôs the power of the machine. But I think once nostalgia wears off and we look back we‚Äôll see how flawed this movie was. Oddly enough I feel like it just made the original spidey films + Garfield‚Äôs films look better while it showed how lacking the MCU spidey is

And my last note is really me just not liking MCU spidey. Holland legit couldn‚Äôt have met the other spideys without Aunt May dying because without that event he had no other way of relating to them. He wasn‚Äôt ever an outcast. He never struggled. He was never broke. He was never bullied. He was who the other spideys could never be because of the trauma they faced in life. So when people say Holland is the best spidey it kinda makes me believe that maybe the best spidey to people isn‚Äôt supposed to be a ‚ÄúSpider-Man‚Äù at all.

It had great villains and the Spidermans were great, but holy god Tom‚Äôs Peter just did the worst decision everytime. They literally did Dr. Stranges first plan at the end, but this time Aunt May is dead.

Also, what is the point of curing everyone (but sandman) if they all die when they forget Peter? Am I missing something in the story because nobody is talking about this. I get it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs what Aunt may did, but cmon. The entire plot of the movie is essentially pointless and only serves to put Tom‚Äôs Peter in a world by himself",ri7eum
hovc7na,"This is less the third movie in the Home trilogy and more the magnum opus of all of Sony‚Äôs Spiderman movies. On top of closing out this trilogy, they were paying off things from Rami and Webb‚Äôs movies. Giving surprisingly great emotional closure both the Spidermen and to Doc Oct, Goblin, Sandman, and even freaking Electro. That moment with Garfield getting choked up after saving MJ got me crying. Especially since the best moments of the entire Amazing duology revolve around Gwen‚Äôs death. 

 I was not ready for that incredibly tragic ending. I was reeling from him losing Aunt May (which I expect to happen but stil). Having him lose MJ, Ned, Happy and everything he‚Äôs worked for hurt like hell. Starting completely from square 1. Broke in a crappy apartment like classic Spiderman sure, but still ouch. I‚Äôm kinda hoping he finds a way to reverse this. The scene in the coffee shop could go either way, but him not trying to tell her then has me thinking he‚Äôs letting them go. Which sucks. They did also have that shot with the same coffee cup on his work bench so maybe he‚Äôs been going back?

Wait could one of the other Gwen/MJ‚Äôs have shown up because since the villains had died, Emma Stone could‚Äôve shown up, right?

The absolute feels with all of Andrew's lines really hit home. He's my favorite Spider-Man and I'm so glad his version was done justice.

All of the interactions between Tobey, Andrew, and Tom are EXCEPTIONAL. The way they consoled Tom after losing May and how they each coped with their losses was heart breaking. And that's just the character work. The choreography was amazing, too. The fight scenes with the villains and the way the Spider-Men played off each other was really smooth. And the fucking memes! ""My back!"" ""You know I'm something of a scientist myself."" ""The power of the sun, in the palm of my hands."" This was Endgame-level fan-service, but it was earned! 

I love how the 5 previously non-MCU movies were tied in, giving them a bit more purpose, if you will, rather than just existing in a limbo.

This movie was dark but filled with redemption and hope, like Spider-Man should be. It's a bit cliche, but this movie made me feel optimistic.

All of the above being said, I found some of the writing / plot development to be weak. Tom recklessly taking out these proven villains with super powers was a very stupid move. And injuries or deaths are on his hands there.

I wasn't a fan of May's ""he's just a misunderstood man."" she has no idea how strong and dangerous this person is, or really any of the relevant information. I wouldn't have minded this if the movie made it a point that Holland's reckless actions had direct consequences, but even May seemed to think that he did nothing wrong.

I loved his introduction with Tony Stark being the mentor, I loved him wrestling with Tony's death and the responsibility he didn't mean to inherit, but him ultimately ending up as the same Spiderman in every other universe, but taking the long way is a really great way to tell the story. It's unique and original and gets Peter to the spot he always belonged in for better or worse. Peter/Spiderman should be a down on his luck character that occasionally has windfalls. He shouldn't be a kid who had a billionaire give him everything right from the start.

So everyone in the multiverse who knows Peter Parker is Spider-Man starts to come to the MCU. To prevent this, Peter tells Strange to cast a spell making everyone forget that Peter Parker exists.

Why not just make everyone forget Peter is Spider-Man like the original spell intended? Then at least Peter will still be friends with MJ and Ned.

But I'm surprised to see that there weren't even any whispers about Kang.

(small as in screentime, not small as in impact or scope)

Especially given the Multiverse of Madness teaser at the end, I was hope there would be SOMETHING about Kang now that we're seeing the multiverse explored in a major film.

We finally got to see him directly addressing the grief of losing Gwen, and what being Spider-Man ultimately cost him. It was a wonderful conclusion to his story, and allowed him to come to peace with the events we saw.

Likewise, Tobey's appearance felt like a great swansong and celebration of who he was as Spider-Man. Less epilogue, more celebration of the franchise that launched it all.

Has it just been the memories of people that have been altered or has ""Peter Parker"" been erased from other things as well. Does Peter have a birth certificate, or school records even if no one remembers him attending High School, what about a social security number?

If he doesn't have those things he is in massive trouble as he is essentially an illegal immigrant who can't go to university and can only get the most crappy jobs which don't ask for things like citizenship or visa status.

However, if he does still have those, and computer records of him still exist does that mean he still has access to Stark tech, because that would mean even if no one remembers him the Stark computers still would, and would grant him access. In theory he could walk into a Stark building and build himself a new Iron Spider suit.

hoxc1rc,"I had fun with this movie! I also got way more emotional than I expected to when Andrew and Tobey showed up. 

But one thing that's been bugging me is Aunt May's death, and how it turns our prior understanding of this Peter Parker into a lie.

I'm thinking back to Civil War and Homecoming. A lot of praise and kudos was given to Marvel for how they handled Spider-Man's introduction. It dropped us into an established Spider-Man; it didn't retread his origin, Uncle Ben's death, power=responsibility, etc.

I remember reading articles and discussions about how cool it was that Marvel and Sony trusted their audience to already know Spider-Man's origin story. I thought it was cool, myself!

While Uncle Ben's death and Peter's role in it were never explicitly mentioned, the implication that it *did* happen was definitely used to influence our view of this Peter Parker. In Civil War, Peter says to Tony Stark, ""if you can do what I do, but don't... and bad things happen, they happen because of you.""

That line tells the audience that yes, this Peter has experienced loss, and yes, this Peter has learned the lesson that all other Peter Parkers have learned.

Our entire view of this Peter has been based on the understanding that he already knew the classic Spider-Man proverb: With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility.

But then this movie reveals that he *didn't* know that. He *never* learned that harsh lesson. Instead, we get this Spider-Man's origin story six movies later, after we were led to believe that he already had one and that we didn't need to see it.

I don't really know how to parse that. I think it fundamentally breaks everything we thought we knew about this Peter Parker.

And that's not to say that I'm against making Aunt May into this Peter's personal tragedy instead of an Uncle Ben. I think that could be a great writing decision! I just think it ended up being a ""have your cake and eat it too"" moment for the MCU.",ri7eum
hoxc891,"I put Spider-Man 2 and 1 with Tobey on a pedestal. After seeing NWH, that's right up there with them, if not better. The star power in this movie is on Avengers level which gives it a huge advantage, but MCU Peter's journey strikes so many chords. From realizing what a curse the responsibility of being Spider-Man is on his life with the loss of Aunt May and soon his friends, his vengefulness towards the Goblin in the final fight, and finally shedding himself from the ""Iron Man Jr"" trope, just tremendous character development and a phenomenal performance from Holland. The ending scene in the coffee shop was heart-wrenching.

&#x200B;

Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin absolutely knocked it out of the park once again. The remorseful Norman before turning back into the Goblin at the apartment had me fooled, I had really believed he changed. When Tom's Spider-Senses went off and he noticed it was him triggering it, that was a great ""oh shit"" moment. ""Norman's on sabbatical!"" in that iconic voice was just too good, that will be remembered as an iconic scene. Heath Ledger as the Joker is the greatest supervillain performance ever, but I think Dafoe's Green Goblin is a very worthy #2 on that list. 

&#x200B;

Electro was great too, loved his redemption arc with Andrew's Spider-Man. Andrew always saw the good in him and knew he wasn't a nobody, wholesome to see. The rest of the villains were a bit underwhelming particularly the Lizard, but it was nice to see Octavius get cured and pick up from his redemption arc from the end of Spider-Man 2. Sandman really never was a bad guy and really did just have bad luck. He just wanted to go  home to his daughter and had trusted Spider-Man to do so. J Jonah Jameson felt like the film's second main antagonist after the Goblin.

I was most looking forward to the return of Tobey and Andrew heading in, and they didn't disappoint or steal the spotlight from Tom too much. Granted, I went wild once Tobey stepped through the portal. He was great as the older and wise Spider-Man and he maintained a lot of his quirkiness from his original dweeby portrayal of Peter Parker. Andrew was hilarious in poking fun at himself for all the shit his movies got. Glad he got his redemption for Gwen too, that was beautiful. 

&#x200B;

I think there were a few missed opportunities with Tobey not acknowledging Jameson at all and not having Mr. Ditkovich as Tom's landlord. Other than that, I have no complaints. 10/10 movie.",ri7eum

hoxf2vn,"I thought the movie was basically perfect, especially since they gave good development and motivation to every character when I was SO worried that the plot would just be a convoluted justification for different action scenes. They included basically every scene the fans could have wanted...jokes about Toby's webs, Osborn memes, with great power comes great responsibility. Andrew was incredible. Only real gripe...I loved the role that Toby played, and everything he got to DO, but his lines and delivery felt alien to his original movies. He was obviously very MCU-ified, more banter and higher energy that before. Maybe his original portrayal wouldn't have fit the tone of this universe, but the final product didn't end up giving me the nostalgia feel that I expected.",ri7eum

It was such an odd, distracting moment in the movie to me. I get that he‚Äôs playing up that he‚Äôs lost and seemingly in need of food and shelter. But during this important moment in the story where Aunt May is proposing the idea of helping all of the movie‚Äôs villains, essentially setting up the action for the rest of the movie, all I could concentrate on was Willem Dafoe in the background, sneakily grabbing one donut after another, and jamming them into his pockets while no one was watching. He just kept hording aIl of these donuts to himself. I was so busy watching this and laughing to myself, I almost missed all of the dialogue between Peter and May.",ri7eum

hoxlh31,"I absolutely loved this movie. I don't think a ""solo"" movie in either the MCU or DC movies will have the same Endgame level effect in me that No Way Home did ever again. Seeing all the villains was great, especially because of how they interacted not only with Tom's Peter/Spider-Man, but the returning Andrew and Tobey Spider-Men as well. Speaking of Andrew and Tobey, I was never completely convinced, but wanted to believe they were gonna be in it and loved every second they were on screen. I'm lucky to be someone that grew up with all three actors as Spider-Man, so all three mean a lot to me. I loved their scene on the Statue of Liberty before the final battle. Normally scenes that go on as long as that are such a drag sometimes, but it never felt out of place for me. I also love the impact that meeting them, as well as everyone else involved, has on Tom's Spider-Man. I've always liked him, and his character growth in the last two movies, but the character development for him in NWH goes above and beyond. Not only does this movie serve as a return and redemption for some of the villains (looking at Jamie Foxx's electro in particular), it is a redemption for the returning Spider-Men, as they have a satisfying ending after both of their last movies being meh at best. I kind of wish we could have gotten a look at their lives once they returned home as maybe their memories would have been unaffected like Tom's Peter since they are also Peter Parker. Perhaps we could have seen Tobey with a happy life, and Andrew being the hopeful Spider-Man he tried to be after Gwen's death once again, maybe even meeting his universe's MJ. Probably a stretch asking for those but oh well. Some final thoughts, I ABSOLUTELY can't wait to see Tom's new suit in full glory. It kind of looked like it resembled the All New All Different suit from the comics but I feel like the final swing intentionally didn't give us a perfect look at it, so it builds hype for the future without a full clean reveal. And finally, everyone has been talking about the villains and Tobey/Andrew being in it, BUT CAN WE TALK ABOUT CHARLIE COX BEING BACK AS MATT MURDOCK???? I know it was a short cameo but Marvel's ""MCU"" Daredevil has been one of, if not my favorite, portrayal of a superhero in film/TV, so seeing him back was amazing. Feige confirmed he'd eventually come back, but I never thought it'd be so soon. This movie is a 50/10 in my book!!",ri7eum

And if there had been a way to hide any suspicion that Tobey and Andrew would be in the movie (which was probably an impossible task, I know) I would have genuinely been freaking the fuck out when they showed up. Unfortunately, you just end up sitting in this movie trying to guess when Tobey and Andrew are going to be revealed, all while checking off the major plot points revealed from the trailers up through the final battle scene.

hoyacby,"Honestly, I don't even think I've collected my thoughts yet. Goodness did this film deliver. The first act, I did have a worry that the movie was going to continue with the teen flick theme that the previous films have had. But once it started going, it just got grander and grander. Literally could feel my own tingle getting stronger and man there's just so many moments that make you smile.

Think this was a true coming of age end to this trilogy. An encapsulation of what Spiderman really is. Peter felt so assured by the end of it that you could tell he was ready to be a hero and almost forget how innocent he started off as in the film. Aunt May's death completely caught me off guard especially with how almost blindsided it felt. I don't think I've seen another death scene like that in the MCU and it really set the stakes for Peter. But as much as I want to talk about Tom, the obvious highlights for me were honestly the dynamic with the rest of the cast. This film almost felt like pure fanservice, giving the closure to so many characters that we've been dying to see. Of the villains, William Defoe and Jamie Foxx stole the show for me. The Green Goblin fully nostalgia bombed me back to the 2000s with how scared he made me feel and for me, electro this time round got a lot more charactization that felt missing before.

And of course my spider fam. I didn't know whether to shout or cry when those two popped up man but I couldn't have asked for anything better. Tobey just fills me with so much pride because to me, he started in many ways this whole journey to a cinematic superhero universe and my interest in it too. You could just see how much maturity and experience his character has out of the three and I couldn't help but smile everytime he spoke or threw out some jokes. And for Andrew, (my favourite) I just felt so much relief  and happiness for how much fun he was having. I'm glad them bigged him up because the way he plays Peter is just so good to me, you could just see the contemplation and pain his character has gone through and the redeeming moment of his tears saving MJ was the best moment of all for me. And gosh, the interaction and love between the three of them is indescribable. Just perfect.

This film was just the perfect culmination and ode to people who've followed all these stories throughout the years. Although, there are a few things I would have to say if I was being overly critical. After the film ended, I did feel a bit strange about the premise literally happening because Peter wanted to go to MIT. Not too sure how I feel about the way he benched Dr. Strange too. And the self-contained nature of the story really does make this film feel like a bit of fanservice especially with the cast coming and going within the events of the film without any stakes otherwise. This might be a bit of selfishness of my part though because I didn't want them to go and I especially wanted to see a bit more combo attacks between the trio rather than them fighting 1-1. Aside from Peter's growth where he does feel like he became fully fledged hero, the end did feel like a hard reset but with a fully leveled up character which I don't think is entirely necessary. Regardless, I had a real good time enjoying the end of this trilogy which is what matters most üòÑüëè",ri7eum

Shout out to everyone making this work with three Spiderman and all the villains. They didn't step on each other's toes for being in it too long, and each felt like continuation of their respective version.

hoz5ais,"From the beginning to the middle-end it was a good movie. I expected that Strange would be there way more often as he took about 80% of the screen time in the trailer. 
I expected that the multiverse would have been used more. Like that Tom Holland would also travel between them or that there would be villains which hadn‚Äôt fight against a Spider-Man yet so it would be a bigger challenge. 

My biggest disappointment is that they gave the main Peter at the end so much options to do what he has promised but he doesn‚Äôt in every option. Like dude 5mins ago MJ told you to say to her ‚ÄûI love you‚Äú and you promised it. 

The solution to solve one of the biggest problems in Marvel history besides the infinity war was just simply male the first spell again but this time without a mistake. Seriously? That‚Äôs all you had to do? Strange hunted Spidey through the mirror dimension to get the failed spell to send a habd full of villains back but to send an ‚Äûarmy‚Äú of villains back you just repeat the spell? Wow.

But at the end of the movie, Doctor Strange could've just modified the spell, without Peter interrupting, now that he knew that Peter wanted MJ, Ned and Happy to remember him being Spider-Man. So why didn't he do that?  
  
I can think of three possible reasons-  
1. The writers wanted to make Spider-Man's sacrifice seem more impactful.  
2. They want to have an in-universe explanation for Spider-Man not appearing in the MCU in future movies(or so that Sony can make Spider-Man films without MCU superheroes) incase the Sony-Marvel deal falls apart.  
3. Doctor Strange felt that making modifications might cause the spell to go awry again.

My favorite part was when that really good lawyer showed up. I hope they utilize him more in the future. Then when the guys were talking about normal spider life occurrences. 


All three Spideys were amazing. They each were Peter Parker in their own different ways. Garfield was my favorite Parker, he's got that insecure awkwardness that I can relate to.

hp3nae7,"Few thoughts:

* Literally the first time I ever actually heard people clapping in a cinema. I always thought it was just a US thing but nope. And it happened twice in one movie!

* I really like that they didn't turn the villains and the other Peters into just cameos. They were integral to the plot of the movie and had plenty of screentime. The callbacks were very tasteful imo.

* That scene on the Statue when they were just talking was the best thing ever right?

* The humour was with a few tiny exceptions totally on point. Garfield being the lame Spider-Man was kinda sad but also hilarious.

* I like that outside of Strange, Happy and a few other nods this was very much a Spider-Man movie. The previous two suffered from being too tied to the MCU.

* Willem Dafoe should just play every character in every movie from now on, he's so good.

* Loved the ending. Very emotional and it felt very Spider-Man. He's back to square one basically, he has no access to Stark tech anymore or any other super hero really. It's kind of a downer but he also learned some important lessons. It actually made me pretty invested in his relationship with MJ and Ned, really curious where they go from here.

* Pacing at the beginning was a bit too frantic imo. Matt showed up almost too randomly and then he was just gone.

* My biggest issue with this movie is the visuals. It's not that the CGI was bad or something, but it's just a very bland looking movie. Everything looks... fake. Not sure how to explain it. Ditto for the cinematography and editing. With all due respect to Jon Watts, he has no visual style to speak of and I wish it was directed by someone else. 

So yeah, I had a great time, it's a fun MCU/Spider-Man movie and the nostalgia was good too. Not sure if I like this or Homecoming more but it's certainly one of the better MCU movies. 8/10",ri7eum
hp3nb6r,This movie is good because of how they really give closure to the previous spidermans. Otherwise it was kinda by the books. They dont do much with the multiverse stuff besides retreading themes of sacrifice and redeeming people who are villains,ri7eum

hp3s51g,"I loved the film. Peter goes through an absolutely fantastic arc. Tom Holland delivered his best performance yet. I'm really glad we finally got hear the iconic ""with great power comes great responsibility"" line.

Some great acting from the cast all around. I love the dynamic and interactions between the three Spider-Men. It was great to see Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield back as Spidey. There was lots of fanservice that was really well done.

The villains were great for the most part. Sandman and Lizard have minor roles compared to the others. Some great performances from them all around. Dafoe in particular was absolutely fantastic in all his scenes.

MJ and Ned had some great moments. I do hope we get to see their characters continue in the story in some form. I haven't been a big fan of Aunt May in these films, but I really liked her character here. It was cool to see her encouraging Peter to do the right thing, and deliver the iconic responsibility line.

All in all, I think this is the strongest MCU Spider-Man film. I'm really excited to see what they have in store for the character in future films.",ri7eum

I could watch that forever man damn.   

The ending felt so sad though, everyone knows spiderman but peter parker is gone? Jesus thats a hard pill to swallow for my favorite superhero and him losing both mj and ned is tragic just to go back to broke peter thats not tied to tony stark.... 

I think my favorite small moment is the introduction for tobey and andrew, they just get pulled by ned and mj and are introduced as just chill guys and thats just perfect for spiderman, he's just a guy, he's not a god or captain america, he's just there hanging out at your grandma's place and you can just get along man. Such a nice intro and it didnt have to be them jumping in to save the day last minute.   

Everyone did a fucking fantastic job acting wise man, tom holland's face breaking with aunt may's death, dafoe and molina just slipping back into their old roles with 100% believability. Old tobey coming into it wise beyond his years as spiderman. This movie is crazy and only works after watching like 7 spidey films.

I mean, with Osborn cured, he goes back and doesn't kill himself, meaning that Harry doesn't become the Goblin.

Depending on when the Lizard was pulled from, Captain Stacy might still be alive then.

Sandman never died and he was still in good terms with Peter, so he was pulled after the fight with Venom.

Electro was pulled during the last fight of Amazing Spider 2. Meaning that him going back cured...doesn't change anything because Harry still kills Gwen.

Same thing with Doc Oc. Him being cured doesn't change much.

So really, the implications of this movie on the previous franchises is that Tobey's Harry Osborn would be ok and maybe or may not have ended up with Mary Jane. And Andrew's Captain Stacy might be alive but Gwen still dies.",ri7eum

hpedtvf,"I just had a big smile on my face pretty much the entire time, especially because Tom Holland is my favorite live-action version of Spider-man thus far, and I feel like this movie does what I felt like this trilogy had been building towards, which was having Tom Holland's Peter Parker fully coming into his own as Spider-man (not ""Ironman junior,"" as so many naysayers seemed to think they were doing). This movie sort of lets the people who don't care for this version of Peter Parker have their cake and eat it too. By the end, he's literally all on his own, so the people who constantly complained about the help he'd get from other characters can finally give all that a rest. Even going into it sort of knowing the main story beats (I mean, Maguire and Garfield showing up was certainly expected), it was still executed really well, in my opinion. And it felt like the movie balanced its characters out very nicely without ever taking away from Tom Holland as the lead. And even though it didn't play out *exactly* as I predicted a few weeks ago, I still feel a little vindicated that they had a version of [this scene in the movie.](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/r68yam/the_idea_of_spiderman_is_so_iconic_and/hmuce8c/)

The secondary villain characters (Electro, Sandman, and Lizard) were fun to see, and Malina killed it as Doc Ock yet again, but the villain highlight for me was Dafoe coming back as Osbourne. He felt much more like an upgraded version of the character from the Raimi movies. Not so different that it feels like a completely different take or performance, but a little more layered and sympathetic. In the Raimi movies, Osbourne (the man, not the Goblin) comes across as a dude who isn't straight up evil but deep down definitely has some problematic qualities (reckless and maybe a little power-hungry), and Goblin really just feels like his worst qualities exemplified to the extreme. But in this movie, he comes across as a genuinely good person/scientist who tragically has (or had) a destructive side of him that he has no control over, and he recognizes it. There's certainly shades of that in the Raimi movies, but the problem there is that Norman is shown to be going along with the Goblin's motives, rather than actively wanting to fight it like he does here.

There's definitely a lot of fan-service sort of stuff, but I felt like this movie incorporated it really well to where the characters showing up made sense. Dr. Strange was awesome, and the clash of morals between him and Peter was a great way to mesh the characters. It's always great to have characters clash in a way where you fully understand and agree with both perspectives. And fucking Daredevil was a fun little cameo. I wish I hadn't seen the leaked image of that beforehand, and really wish Hawkeye had waited one more week to showcase Kingpin, but it's great to have them in the MCU proper regardless. I never really saw Tom Hardy's Venom movies because they... didn't look very good. That being said, I like Hardy and given the movie's end credits scene, I'm a little bummed that he probably won't actually get to interact with Holland's Peter Parker. That is, unless the MCU ""recasts"" him as Eddie Brock 2.0, kind of like they did with JK Simmons. But hey, I'll take a goofy little cameo that brings the symbiote into the MCU.

Garfield, Maguire, and Holland all played off each other very well, and I was happy with the screen time they all had together. I definitely think Garfield outshined Maguire just a little bit, and felt a little more true to his original portrayal. Maguire still felt like his version of Peter, just an older version we never really got to see for ourselves (which obviously makes sense given his age). As such, his presence felt a little more like a ""remember Tobey Maguire Spider-man"" wink to the audience, whereas Garfield just felt like they snatched his character right out of his movies without skipping a beat. Even still, they had enough of a presence to make their inclusion meaningful (even giving Garfield a very touching ""redemption"" with saving MJ) without ever taking away from the larger story. In other words, they didn't overstay their welcome, and arrived precisely when they needed to.

Overall, if this movie is meant to be a sort of sendoff to Tom Holland in the MCU, I genuinely hope that doesn't end up being the case as I've really come to enjoy his version of the character the most, and I feel like it'd be interesting to see where they take him from here, especially if they're sort of rebooting characters like Daredevil and Kingpin. Of course, I don't really think the MCU is done with Holland just yet (assuming Disney and Sony continue to play nice), but if this is the movie to give Tom Holland a send off in the MCU, I would be satisfied with that.",ri7eum

hpj03rk,"Just watched it, here are a few thoughts.

Most of the best moments are already mentioned here so I‚Äôll note a few of my own.

**Electro.** The very small but recognizable piece of music/beat that accompanied Electro‚Äôs appearance put a smile on my face. Electro‚Äôs theme was a gem in the Amazing Spider Man.

Him commenting on how he wished Spider-Man was black was heartbreaking, the essence of his character captured in once sentence. Something his own movie was not able to accomplish. This movie allowed viewers like me to sympathize with him and truly understand where he was coming from.

**Goblin** His relationship with Tom in this movie reminded me of Batman/Joker‚Äôs relationship in TDK. Goblin was just illogical and straight up insane, and despised Tom‚Äôs Spidey for who he is, tried to break him and managed to do so in the end. He is so irredeemably evil, he tried to kill Tobey‚Äôs aunt, and once again without hesitation tried to kill/succeeded in killing Tom‚Äôs aunt this time, because he knows that would break Spider-Man.

For the first time I really felt a terrible sense of danger from this goblin, especially when he arrived in the end and messed everything up.

**Spider-Men.** One thing I disliked was how Tobey‚Äôs Spidey quite literally *walked* into the movie, like he knew exactly what was going on, almost breaking the fourth wall. It‚Äôs fine in the overall picture as I did not have time to fully process this bizarreness because of my excitement.

As a viewer, his presence in the movie made me feel like everything was ‚Äúokay,‚Äù and his perspective was much wider than both of the other Spider-Men. Despite that, he knows better, and merely played the part in the events and allowed the other Spider-Men to experience it like he did. 

Overall, such a good movie. I think it was a movie about youth, maturity, responsibility, loss and regret. 

Strongest point lie in the movie's success in redeeming a lot of characters and loose ends from other Spider-Man movies, while also characterizing them *a lot* better, especially Sandman, Electro and Lizardman.",ri7eum

1. What happened to all the **video/image** evidence about Peter being Spider-Man go after Dr. Strange did his magic? (E.g Mysterio's Expose video, Photos people took of Peter without his mask on etc.)
2. Idk if my mind blurred and missed it during the exchange of Peter and Strange but why did everyone forget who **Peter Parker** is? (E.g Ned, Happy, MJ)                                        *^((Did Strange say ""Everyone was gonna forget who)* ***^(Peter Parker)*** *^(is""?

3. This is kinda a weird question but did **Everyone** and I mean ***Everyone*** *^((Across the Multiverse)**)* forget about Tom Holland's Spider-Man? or is it just Tom's World that forgot about him? (E.g Doctor Octavius, the other Spider-Mans, Norman Osborn etc.) < *^((did they forget?)**)*

Like the ""keep searching for peters until we get him"" but they obviously stop after maguire. Why, they still didnt have the Peter they wanted. Then Tobey says ""Any place he would go"". Like come on, you really gonna play MJ and Ned dumb like that. Aunt May's death felt forced and unnecessary but I guess plot reasons.

hqtkl6q,"Wonderful movie. Some basic thoughts : 

Wow never considered that there was no Uncle Ben in Tom Holland universe (no headstone for him in cemetery next to May). In this universe Tom Holland became Spider Man not because of some tragedy, but because it was simply the right thing to do.  

Why was Electro in this movie? He clearly states to Andrew Garfield that he thought his Spider Man was black, so he didn‚Äôt know who Spider Man was.  But I‚Äôm assuming the writers just needed more characters from that Universe.  Although I am sure that some fan can make up an explanation that works. 

Andrew Garfield.  I hated his Spider Man movies.  Comic Book movies are never good if their villains are not fully fleshed out and interesting.  I found those movies a bit boring and I hated his Peter Parker who seemed to have the angst and over acting level turned up way too high. But I really loved his scenes in this movie.  I am going to have to revisit these movies. 

The One Day More ending.  Not sure how someone like Peter can be erased from existence and be able to actually get an apartment in this day and age without shield help, but hey; magic.  But now we get to see a Peter stripped of everything and having to rebuild a life, create a new life and be our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man and not Iron Man Jr.

Peter defeated both Doc Ock and Strange by manipulating their powers. I‚Äôm still wrapping my head around that.

Electro being disappointed in Peter Three not being black made me think ‚Äòif only this were Miles‚Äô MCU introduction‚Äô. They did an amazing job reinventing this role that I found Jamie Foxx very miss casted in ASM2.

Speaking of that, I was soo happy that Andrew mentioned Rhino. I really wanted Paul Giamatti to be in this film, but at least he was acknowledged. He said he had been out of practice as Spidey though? Why was he wearing the  outfit if so?

I guess it helped keep their involvement a secret as it was only VO, but couldn‚Äôt Sandman transform back into his human form? Connors was stuck IIRC though.

I guess this spell will tie directly into Multiverse of Madness and Strange and Wong will be like ‚Äòwhy did you cast that thing anyway? Did we try to help someone?‚Äô

hp5tn7y,"\[SPOILERS\] Spider-Man No Way Home was just a boring brew of references, memes, and call backs; Or how Feige is making Marvel feel stale.

Prepare for a long winded, and cynical review.

\>! Don‚Äôt get me wrong. No Way Home was an amazing film with some great character arcs, (Tom, May, and Oc) when I first watched it. On a second and third viewing however, the amount of fan service was unbearable. There were so many times I wanted to walk out from cringey references. Specifically Hobgoblin (Ned‚Äôs line) and Miles (Electro‚Äôs line). Especially after Strange said that there are infinite people that know Peter is Spider-Man. Yet STRANGLY all the references, and characters we see are ones that the masses are familiar with. Not hardcore fans. I‚Äôm talking about the average cinema goer. I‚Äôm sure everyone and their Nan knows Alfred‚Äôs Doc Oc and Miles Morales. !<

\>! I have always loved spider-man. So it was my most anticipated film of the past couple of years. My inner child was excited beyond belief watching it. But to me, this failed where ‚ÄòInto the Spider-Verse‚Äô succeeded, where they brought these abstract characters to the lime light. Hell, even marvel knows this is a winning formula with an unknown Ironman in 2008, then with the unknown Guardians of the Galaxy. !<

\>! As a ‚ÄúSpider-verse‚Äù story. This is definitely the most cashgrabby ones they could have EVER thought of. I‚Äôm talking purely about stories where spidey meets versions of himself. Be that Into the Spiderverse, or all the different comics. Miles would have made cash but the ‚Äòoriginal Spider-Man‚Äô, and the ‚Äòamazing Spider-Man‚Äô? $$$. !<

\>! As a character living inside the universe, it‚Äôs fine, because they don‚Äôt know each other. But as a viewer, trying to suspend my disbelief is impossible. Trying to imagine a convoluted reason why the only 3 live action Spider-Men we have seen, are the ONLY ones to meet on this film in a multiverse with INFINITE Peter Parker Spider-Men. It‚Äôs a BIG coincidence. Or, an easier alternative for my mind, my belief is broken and I see it as a cheap cash grab. The way that it worked with ‚ÄòInto the spider verse‚Äô is that it‚Äôs breaking the 4th wall. By talking to the audience with all of their introductions. And this is where references work great too! Just as the infamous Spider-Man 3 dance was in one introduction. But with Tobey, AND Andrew, AND Willem and Alfred. being there, it‚Äôd been as great as it would be cringe to see Tobey say ‚Äúnow dig on this..‚Äù Again, only if I see this as a meme movie. Which is as funny as it is bad. !<

\>! So, Tom Holland's Spider-Man goes to Dr Strange, to ask him to cast a spell so everyone forgets Peter is Spider-Man. Strange is clearly fine with this in the beginning, even coming up with the idea himself after being reminded that he cast it on Wong before. So this is all fine. Until Tom breaks the spell. Ok, as a storyline it works. But then at the end. Tom goes to Strange on the Statue of Liberty and says. Just do it, I want everyone to forget Peter Parker. And Strange reacts like he‚Äôs losing his oldest and best friend, tearing up. Are we going round in circles here?! What makes it worse is somehow Strange actually cares about Peter‚Äôs choice now. Not that the spell might backfire, but he clearly only cares that he will forget Peter Parker. Come on..? Why? !<

\>! Then Charlie Cox's Matt Murdock scene was clearly added later and had NO relevance to the story other than, you guessed it, fan service. Now, here‚Äôs the thing.. In comics, this shit happens all the time. Small cameos of other superheroes/characters showing up for sometimes just a panel or two. It makes the universe feel more alive, and how everything is connected in some ways. This is also fan service. And it‚Äôs epic when it happens. Its just when it‚Äôs live action, it doesn‚Äôt feel right. Maybe because deep down, I know that with The McU, the first agenda is money. ‚ÄúWhat attracts the biggest audience?‚Äù This is why the Eternals is full of famous actors. They didn‚Äôt trust the audience enough to fall in love with new characters played by unknown actors. Specifically to bring in fans of other movies/shows. !<

\>! This leads me on to the idea of cameos: I think it‚Äôs hard to explain. For me a cameo in a comic book feels so natural because besides short appearances, there are many scenes with hundreds of characters appearing at once in a lots of comics all the time. In the McU this happened in one(as awesome as that was) scene in Endgame, then no one saw each other again. How many people in that battle live in New York, and are never seen by Clint in the ‚ÄôHawkeye‚Äô show for example. Fisk is an exception here. Because his story adds something (pure speculation for episode 6). Matt‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt. It just connects the universes very cheaply. !<

\>! They could have had a whole court drama with Peter vs Mysterio after his death. Hell, 5 mins of the film could have been dedicated to that. Just pure lawyer Matt. That‚Äôs a good use of him, creates story and is a short cameo. Something you‚Äôd expect to see in a comic book. Instead he catches a brick and says I‚Äôm a really good lawyer. What about the people that have never seen him as daredevil? Yes we know it‚Äôs Matt Murdock from the comics. That is all. Imagine if watching Batman, a guy turns up and says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bad guy, I like to fly on a kite!‚Äù People would be so confused. Omg it‚Äôs Kite Man! Funny yes. But WHY? !<

\>! All he did was show/say: I‚Äôm blind but I can catch things because I have incredible senses. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a really good lawyer‚Äù Connecting them in a humorous way as to say the reason I caught it is because I‚Äôm a good lawyer. Boom, his entire backstory is set in one line for new audiences? Hmm. !<

And strangely, Strange completely slipped my mind as a cameo. That‚Äôs how they can do it right! Then people don‚Äôt even realise it‚Äôs a cameo. Wong and Abomination felt out of place in Shang-Chi. !<

Anyway, I‚Äôm getting off topic now so will stop, as I could talk about the McU forever.

Now onto random points.. ‚Å†

\>! WHY?! They finally had a chance to go with a Sinister 6 but didn‚Äôt.. !<

\>!‚Å†Tom Hardy has either been shifted, or is giving up the role of Eddie now. Not venom. So IMO the venom scene is sad in a way. I take it as Feige saying ‚ÄúYeah we want Venom, and it‚Äôs extremely popular with Hardy atm. Buuut I don‚Äôt exactly like Hardy. So imma take venom, keep him here. And send Hardy back. Too much hassle.‚Äù Or maybe Tom Hardy just doesn‚Äôt want to be signed on in the McU. He is an extremely hard working and busy actor. I expect he‚Äôs going to be voicing venom still though. Which makes me think he‚Äôs only agreed to a voice contract. And doesn‚Äôt want to play Eddie any more. !<

\>! ‚Å†If you‚Äôre going all out and spunking all of your cash on cameos. Go all out and get Keaton back. And the Scorpion teaser? Giamatti too. Oh and fuck it. Hey, get Bruce Campbell back. And shake hands with a dead Jake Gyllenhaal /s. Or at LEAST film some new footage with Thomas Haden Church and Rhys Ifans instead of cheaply recycling footage. !<

\>!There is never any noticeable advertisements, which is an admirable thing as it‚Äôs a strange bias where you only really notice cheap advertising when it‚Äôs in your face. But if the McU are doing it at all, I‚Äôm not realising. Although I do want to watch 'Rogers: The Musical' for some reason.. !<

Part 1 because there is too many characters. Part 2 in comments",ri7eum
howbm86,"it was a great homage movie, but just an ok movie on its own  


take away the nostalgia part, the action scenes and the interactions between the spidermans were really poorly thought out and executed. they all seemed like generic fight scenes.

they could have done so much more with this to be really exiting, I feel no action scene is memorable

for example when in endgame thanos gets hit by the hammer, then it's revealed that captain america threw it + that awesome short fight scene that follows, that is light years ahead of any scene in this movie",ri7eum
howbz5j,"The visuals were amazing, and I loved the characters (as always with marvel) but the movie was held back by constant interruptions, bad pacing, and strange decision making. So many things just happen out of nowhere, or happen by magic. Like Doc Oc and goblin finding Peter on the bridge, then Peter randomly coming across Electro and Sandman, then Tobey and Garfield coming out of Ned's portals.

There was a lot of wasted potential. I was really expecting Tobey/Garfield reveal to be more intertwined with the plot, maybe a dramatic save during a fight. Instead we got awkward comedy in a living room. The fights keep getting interrupted which kills the momentum. Doc Oc fight starts, gotta save person A, gotta save person B. Goblin shows up, boom magic portal. Hey Sandman and Electro, boom magic teleporting thread. Goblin smashes Peter? Better go see Aunt May on the stairs. Big finale fight? Cut to MJ/Ned. There could have been some really cool crossover fights between the villains and even the spidermen but those were unexplored. The final battle pacing was not very good. Villains weren't really defeated in a satisfying climax. We could‚Äôve had teamwork, strategy,  killer moves, or redirecting enemy attacks win the day. Instead, the cures were kind of an asspull and doc oc just saunters in and takes out electro.

Peter's choice to free the villains and take them to the apartment made no sense. Why risk their release? Why not bring the fabricator to the prison and fix the villains there? I also can't wrap my head around the objective of curing the villains before sending them back. They're trying to kill you. Some of them don't even want to be cured. You're putting so many at risk to try to save them when there is the option to just send them back. It's too morally righteous imo.",ri7eum
hp3ew8r,"This movie is a mess. Yes it's really freaking fun and it's amazing that something like this can exist, but it was done pretty wrecklessly which I get is the point, but I mean its VERY contrived but I get thats all part of the fun... but I can't get over how big of a misstep it is when you consider it the finale of a trilogy.

Also, I may be wrong but I'm pretty sure Ben is mentioned in Homecoming and we know he's already dead. Homecoming is about a year after Peter being bit. I always thought it was implied that in that time Ben was killed and Spidey has his vengeful moment that then turns him into the hero that will never kill.

Honestly this movie kills this Peter's character. He has already been through so much so I don't really buy Stranges explanation of Peter being ""just a kid"". They assassinate his character (what do you mean you didn't call the admissions office before asking me to brainwash the world) and play it off as a joke.

And, I guess this was my expectations playing with me again, but I really thought that since a new trilogy was already announced, and with Eddie Brock already being teleported into the MCU (which I thought was from Loki fucking around) that maybe they would somehow end up in Eddie's San Fran (or New York) which is why it's ultimately called No Way Home.

In fact they really assassinate Venom 2s post credit scene too. It doesn't even make sense, right? The spell draws multiversal people that know spiderman. Eddie, nor Venom, knew Spider-Man or Peter Parker til they were teled. 

All in all, pretty carelessly written for the sake of one fucking bonkers movie. Everyone looks like they're having fun (except Cbatch) and the villains really stole the show.


Edit: also, Marvel ruins Venoms post credit and also shits on Sonys contributions by making the post credit scene basically a trailer for a future marvel movie rather than an actual scene. Pretty corporate movie.",ri7eum
hovb784,"The multiverse setup is basically nonsense to justify the fan service, but what fan service! I never bought that Strange wouldn't hash out the details with Peter before casting the spell, but ehhh fuck it, it was worth it for what we got.

Really fun film, but I think it falls short of Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Verse as an actual complete, well-written story. People calling this the best Marvel movie ever are nuts. I'd give it like 7.5/10. 

Also thought Jon Watts' direction was pretty flat in places, a lot of the big moments would've felt even more impactful with a better filmmaking doing them. Some weirdly boring shot selections in marquee moments.",ri7eum
howlzi0,[deleted],ri7eum
hova9ty,"I thought it was a near perfect comic book movie. To me it was the prettiest MCU movie so far - from simple things like that take of Spider-man swinging on the transmission towers, with his silhouette on the dusk, to the terrific way his Spider-sense tingled when Green Goblin returned, it seemed like the result of mixing every single thing that made the previous Spider-man movies noteworthy.



The fight in the condo was neat. The shots of them breaking through the floors was visceral.



Unfortunately I was spoiled about the death, but I didn't believe when I read it and I wasn't believing even after the reporter confirmed a casualty.



The chemistry between the Peters was amazing. I almost cried when The Spectacular Spider-man felt redeemed and I was smiling all the way seeing Andrew Garfield at his most natural performance, kinda like he was redeeming himself too.



I know ""disappointing"" is a strong word, but I'll use it for the lack of a better one: I thought it was a bit disappointing that Venom didn't appear. I also think that other super-heroes (like Falcon or War Machine, and specially Daredevil) could have cameo'd and it wouldn't detract anything from the Spider-meeting. Them helping wouldn't steal the scene anymore than Dr. Strange or Doc Ock did in the final battle, and if any of the two already established characters appeared, I think it could deepen both the erasure of Peter Parker as well as the consequences Dr. Strange will have to face with different people in his next movie - which, by the way, I loved that it was teased with a proper teaser trailer instead of a single scene.



The only flaw in the movie was in the first post-credit scene; the bartender mentioned his whole family was blipped, but when Eddie disappeared his reaction was regarding the money instead of assuming it was another kind of blip.



It'd be a nice twist if they use that small part of symbiote to set up Spider-Woman, but I honestly have no idea of what will become of it. I doubt they'll tackle the costume once again and Venom seems to be doing just fine in the Sony Universe for him to be re-used in the MCU in any other way. I have no idea.",ri7eum

hozksnw,"Wow.  I think that may have cracked my top 5 which was previously reserved for the Russo brothers movies.

The Good:  The multiverse is here for real, obvious plus.  The references, I felt like Leo pointing at the screen for half the movie, loved the return of, 'I'm something of a scientist myself.'  Sure you are, Norman.  Aunt May dying (also, Tom's spider-man DID have an Uncle Ben, and no mention?) came as a HUGE shock and it wasn't really telegraphed at all.  I like how they are moving Spider-Man back to his more classic roots after his trilogy as an Avenger.  Clearly listening to fans that want a more traditional take on the character.  I also thought it was cool that the ending sets up Spider-Man to return OR gives a plausible reason he's no longer around if something happens with the deal between Marvel and Sony.  Clever. 
Molina was fantastic and I liked the bit where he gets the nano-tech and uses the 'You listen... to... me...' again (except not this time). Holy shit I almost forgot Matt Murdock.  The whole gang's getting back together!  So great to see them give Charlie Cox more time with the character!

The Not So Good:  A lot of the characters just seemed... off.  Dr. Strange, Toby and Andrew, Aunt May, Ned, and MJ just all seemed like they weren't quite on brand.  It wasn't game breaking but was jarring at times (Scooby-Do that shit?  What?).  The villains got a bit too crowded and they didn't really mesh together; it was like they were fighting 5 separate villains instead of 5 villains, if that makes sense.  Marvel benefited from the fact that they had character development in their own movies/universes but they were a bit one-dimensional (Heh.  Get it?) here.  Also the bit at the end with the glider happening inside a GIANT VERSION OF CAP'S SHIELD felt a bit on the nose after Civil War. I thought the banter between Toby, Andrew and Tom was good but was a little forced and went on a little too long at times (like the 'You're amazing!' bit, too much, once would have been fine).  In a two and a half hour movie I'd rather see other things than drag it out. The final set piece was a bad choice IMO, too similar to the first Spider-Man 3 which was not good at all.  Did not want to see Hardy's Venom at all and got scared when he showed up in the after-credits.  Glad he got booted quick AND left the possibility of a proper Venom story.

Also not really intended by the movie, I love how everyone was calling/speculating the black suit his 'anti-magic suit' and it turned out to be his regular suit inside out.

Also also the end credit for Dr. Strange was a straight up trailer and I am here for it.",ri7eum

The only thing that would have made it a better experience is if the damn theatre I was in was capable of containing their excitement enough that I didn‚Äôt miss the lines that happened right after those big moments like when Andrew and Tobey were revealed.

My one critique of the movie, I suppose, is that it didn‚Äôt really make sense why Max/Electro was so different in this universe. His character was definitely so much better, but he was basically an entirely different person and we didn‚Äôt really get any explanation for it. It was acknowledged and swept under the rug.

hp2i6pq,"Was this movie perfect? No.

Did this movie exceed my expectations? 100%

This movie was everything I could ask for. So much fan service. Didn't feel too bloated. Each villain had their own agenda. Andrew stole the show for me. Him getting emotional over saving MJ was just perfect. I loved Andrew's portrayal in his movies. He deserves better. Maybe he can be Spidey for the venom cinematic universe if he wants to do it again. 

William Dafoe also was phenomenal. He was one of the highlights along with Andrew. That scene where Tom was just beating him up and Norman was unphased with each punch while laughing at him was haunting.

I am more excited about the future of tom's Spider-Man. With that ending, we're going to see the Spider-Man we fans always wanted. He's no longer tied to Tony's technology with his suit. He made his own new suit that looks AMAZING! I need to see more pictures of the suit at the end. Tom getting a new start will definitely be a breath of fresh air. I will definitely need to go and watch this a few more times. I am still taking this in after watching it last night.",ri7eum
hp3uck5,"I enjoyed it.

‚Ä¢ I liked seeing Matt Murdock. I don‚Äôt particularly care about the Netflix Daredevil show but I like Charlie Cox and I thought that was a fun scene. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a really good lawyer‚Äù was probably my favorite line in the movie.

‚Ä¢ Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe killed it. They really fell right back into the characters so well that you wouldn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs been like 20 years. 

‚Ä¢ Jamie Foxx was a lot of fun too! I really hated Electro in TASM2, but he got a lot more to do here and had some great lines. I really liked the bit about being careful what you fall into; having all these villains together really drives home how silly their origin stories actually are.

‚Ä¢ As MCU climaxes go, the fight on the Statue of Liberty was fun. I still think a lot of the special effects were really ugly, but there was more going on than just animated people punching each other so I appreciated that. I will say, though, that the Statue of Liberty holding a Captain America shield is dumb as shit. Kind of felt like Marvel jerking themselves off a bit.

‚Ä¢ I thought overall the action was fine(ish) but it wasn‚Äôt nearly as enjoyable as just watching the characters interact. I wish we would‚Äôve gotten more scenes of the different Spider-Men just shooting the shit and swapping stories.

‚Ä¢ Kind of a weird ending. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs setting up a future story where Peter has to remind everyone who he is, or if this is just a way of wiping the slate clean so the next film can be almost like a fresh start. It would honestly be a bummer if they got rid of MJ and Ned, but maybe they want to do that so they can introduce Gwen and Harry? I dunno, guess we‚Äôll see.

Best one was seeing Dr Octavius but he really doesn't do anything after that highway fight scene. The Green goblin fight in the condo was great too. Sandman idk why he's attacking Peter. There's so much wrong idk where to begin example like ned suddenly being able to use magic. Strange and everyone else had to train to use magic.

This movie is Marvel Marvelling as hard as they can Marvel. We should all know by now whether or not we will enjoy this movie. The humor, the set pieces and fight choreography, the callbacks, the emotion. It's all here, well balanced, and just a good time to watch. And I like the direction they take Holland Spiderman in. They keep taking things away from him. First his suit, then his mentor, now all of his friends and family. It really feels like he's maturing a little bit more each movie. 

As for what makes this stand out from other Marvel movies, the answer is clearly the introduction of the multiverse and the handling of all the ""prior universe"" cameos. And, honestly, unless you were hinging your happiness on Paul Giamatti screaming in a Russian accent then I don't know what more you could have asked for. 

The villains this movie brought back got an extended arc, a little  redemption for all of them in a way. And the past Spider-Men got their moments in the sun. Tobey got to save Norman where he had originally failed and fractured his relationship with Harry. And Andrew got to save MJ. This movie doesn't just bring the characters back for the memes, although the memes are present, but it gives them an arc that continues from a decade or two ago. 

What's ultimately impressive about this movie, which is the revival of so many great characters, is also probably what lead to its main issues which are mostly technical.

Which is alright, I mean its a fun movie. But it's also indicative of how MCU is just turning into a machine that churns out movie/show every month with same overall plot lines/trophes and is quickly being bloated. The only reason it had a good villain was because it brought back an already established villain.... and then immediately got rid of them. Same problem with each movie. I honestly think they need to hit the brakes and just focus on 2-3 movies a year (and maybe a show or 2) like they did during Phase 1-3 and go for more diverse heroes like F4, Ghost Rider and all. Because as it stands... we have like 2 arrow people, like a dozen peeps who are just super soldiers/martial artists, handful of sorcerers, 3 Marvels (soon), and so on... and maybe 2 decent villains.

The only great reveal for me was Matt Murdock. I did think Maguire & Garfield were going to be just cameos at the end so it was a nice surprise they did have such pivotal roles. 

The only downside is the ending suggests that's it for Spider-Man in the MCU - none of the Avengers will remember him and I think that's what Sony wanted.

I thought it was a very mediocre film with an extremely thin plot, a lot of lukewarm performances and some of the worst examples of ""MCU cringe writing"" out there. As someone who thoroughly enjoyed the ride from Iron Man all the way through Endgame this is the movie that has finally convinced me to stop watching the franchise. 

The first 10 minutes or so were really good, but having the whole plot predicated on Peter making some weird decision over getting into MIT was a nonsense choice. Sooo many plot convenience type moments that have ridiculous implications, and not even just the magic stuff - for example, Peter whipping up what is essentially an instant cure for schizophrenia in like 2 minutes?

I did laugh and I did enjoy a couple of the cameos but so much of the movie just felt ""off"" to me. Once Garfield entered it largely felt like I stopped watching a movie and I started watching a bunch of actors pretending to be superheroes - not just because of the cameos, but also because of the awkward, stilted dialogue, the performances and what seemed like uncharacteristically bad greenscreen work.

It felt like this movie wanted to be Into the Spiderverse, but instead of substance and a flashy, creative style, it opted for lots and lots of cameos that would make audiences say, ""HEY, I REMEMBER THAT!"" Apparently that's all some people need though.

Jamie Foxx was also really atrocious btw, he outdid his over-the-top ""I'm evil"" performance from Baby Driver. He can certainly act but they really need to stop giving him generic bad guy roles. Willem Dafoe was at least doing the best he could with what he was given.",ri7eum

Peter is upset that he and his friends cant get into school and in the end this ends up leading to literally everyone he cares about not knowing who he is.  And the movie plays it off like that's supposed to be a good thing for the people that forgot him.  

I loved all the scenes with the 3 spidey's but other than that the plot was insanely stupid and I was not a fan of the movie overall.  A lot of the humor (besides with the 3 spidey's) was pretty bad and yeah, just the whole plot in general seemed like a really dumb thing for Strange to even attempt to do.  I enjoyed the action scenes but the writing to get into the action is just so bad.  And the ending was so dumb IMO, they obviously just wanted a way to start fresh with Tom's Spiderman, so they take away all character progression to start back at square one, but without any pesky side characters I guess.

But yeah TL;DR, everything with the 3 spidey's was great; but the overall story and forced humor was pretty bad.",ri7eum
hp4xj08,"I‚Äôm definitely going to say a very unpopular opinion, pls don‚Äôt hate on me too bad. but the only good characters in this movie were literally not from that universe. They are the only reason I would rewatch this film. 

Sorry that Aunt May died, but maybe Peter can stop being so naive now. Like, Aunt May death was actually a Peter‚Äôs fault (and her own fault) compared to all the other death the other Peter‚Äôs experienced. I get it they want to make the villains good again but you‚Äôre really going to put a handful of bad guys together in one room and trust they‚Äôll not act out? And I get you don‚Äôt want them to die, but people die and honestly half of them deserve it, you know since they already killed a bunch of people already. Plus once they go back, good and powerless, they‚Äôre not going to have a normal life anymore. Probably prison. Also. Ned was annoying, the whole interrogation scene was dumb. After everything you‚Äôve been through and seen your best friend go through, you would think you would be mature enough to not talk about things you know you shouldn‚Äôt be talking about. 

I like that Peter will now how to deal with the hardship it came from being Spider-Man, not to say he hasn‚Äôt. But he definitely had a lot of things handed to him so seeing him start from the beginning again is nice. As much as I hate his views and shit, I still enjoy watching this spider-man and all the fight scenes and the wonderful shots. The ending and his interaction with the other guys was amazing! I LOVED Andrew and Tobey. I would watch a whole other film with them all together again. I could tell they probably loved being spider-man again, especially Andrew. He could do such a good job if he had another chance with better writer.

I would like to add, no way did they suddenly make cures for everyone in like 30 minutes in a HIGH SCHOOL lab lmaoo 

(I also get that Tom‚Äôs spider-man‚Äôs whole thing is to be the good and see the good in others, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I have to like it and have to sit and watch them not do the smart thing and send everyone back. Lots and lots of things could‚Äôve been avoided.)",ri7eum

hq14q36,"Go hit the downvote for this one; I thought NWH was pretty disappointing ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

For the resources and the cast they managed to bring together, the story and characterisation sucked. It was just fan service for the sake of it. Idk maybe when everyone in the nostalgia circle jerk cums and gets that post-nut clarity it might be more clear but this is a thin movie that relies solely on the image of the past franchises. 

Why would damage control be trying to prosecute Peter for the London attack based on a media story over SHEILD intel? Also doesn't his suit take recordings of what he sees? Why does Peter, who we know as a smart, well-mannered kid keep talking through a spell that he's told shouldn't be used lightly when he can tell its making it worse? For the same reason why wouldn't Strange talked him through the process earlier soto be more exact? Why does Strange look fucked in the face?

I wanted to like NWH but movies start to lose me pretty quick when characters act irrational or unlike we've come to know them. These are small things but if the movies interesting I'll look past them, instead I'm asking myself was there a point to showing Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock? How does Peters suit work inside-out? Why did the villains come through just before they died in their universe but their Spiderman counterparts had lived came through later in life? Didn't Doc Oc have power over the tentacles before he died in S2? Why was Sandman evil? Why include May and Happy separating for no impactful reason?

A lot of the quips or comedy beats fell flat too. Especially when Garfield and Macquires  Peter Parkers came together. It looked really cheap and tired like an improvised SNL/FunnyOrDie skit.

I don't really expect to change any opinions and i wish i liked it so unconditionally as many people do but a good movie has to have good story & character.

hoxxa2k,"Tricky space right now... The film was a complete fail for me. Incredible intentions with the most risk averse decisions.

I know part of the problem is interpreting established characters from other ""universes"" into Holland's, and Holland's universe is extremely narrow, fun, and light. It's also super dependent on being narratively driven by the MCU... Not sure this was ever going to work differently without going to great lengths to change how the Holland films work. Consider how many Holland Spiderman films we've had, and how little character development or meaningful changes have happened over the course of his trilogy.

One example of a botched interpretation was Doctor Strange. This guy, who's anal about protecting space and time or whatever, was fine with brainwashing the entire world because Peter wanted his friends to get into MIT? Then gets mad at Peter for not being diligent enough with college admissions? But only after he botches the spell? Moments before he even commits to doing this, he seems pretty convinced that Peter should live with his identity out in the open. I get it, this is Doctor Strange in a Spiderman movie so he's going to be a bit different. I'm fine with that. But all of this was so poorly thought out. 

The proper way of doing this would've been taking Holland (and crew) and Garfield, and throwing them into the Raimi-verse. The villains could've still been campy but at the same time feel like villains. You could actually do something meaningful and interesting with Tobey's Spiderman this way too. Like honestly, what a waste of a cameo the way it is. He shows up, makes jokes, rehashes his fight with Norman, which by the way was hashed and rehashed a few times in his own trilogy, and then that's it. Just such a wasted opportunity.

I get it, people cheered and clapped when they saw characters they recognized. But our expectations should be higher than ""did the villains say the funny lines?"", or ""did they do the Spiderman point meme?"" or ""did Daredevil show up for a 1 minute cameo?"" And I know, Andrew saved MJ, and Aunt May died... even these bigger beats were problematic.

When Andrew patted Ned's shoulder in support after Ned promised he wouldn't become a supervillain (foreshadowing?) I laughed my ass off.

Ock face turn was more realized than it was in SM2.

No permanent crossover with the Sonyverse set up. 

Peter not telling MJ seems kind of lazy, the MCU did the romantic angle of the character better than either of the previous iterations and erasing it is a mistake. I imagine that they're saving them getting back together to be one of the big payoffs for the second trilogy, but I was hoping that they'd avoid the biggest failure of One More Day and let us keep MJ in the background as Peter's partner and emotional rock.

He high-key killed his aunt and has shown no character development in the 5+ films we have seen him in. He may be a teenager, but a teenager who has lived through wars, lost his mentor, was MIA for five years, should neither be as selfish as Peter (in reversing the MIT decision) nor as impulsive (in reversing the fate of these men).

I'm glad they didn't though, because being the older, wiser Spider-man is itself is a big part of his character development. But even aged, his face retains something of that wide-eyed innocence that made his Peter Parker stand out.

I remember laughing at the scene in ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" when Andrew's Spider-man failed to save Gwen. The silly ham-fisted symbolism of his web taking the form of an outstretched hand was just too much and destroyed the emotional impact.

hovnw6g,"There were things to like, leaning into the inside memes and some new good quips. But nothing really hit for me emotionally. Extremely dense plot that seemed to skip around. Aunt may acting like it was okay for a solid minute before collapsing dead, the spiderman 3 style ending where you have to talk with everyone scene by scene so even though you have a minute to talk with the woman you love most in the world.. you need to spend half of it with your spider bros who won't remember you.

Maybe the one scene that was structured well and hit correctly was Peter letting MJ forget him.

hoxmafp,"What a miserable attempt at a trilogy this has been. Not only does it not even function as a proper trilogy due to requiring a watch of IW and Endgame as well, but it repeats the same arc for Peter in each film, at the end of this film, Peter is  now finally at the point of being his own hero and a Spider-Man not reliant on Stark Tech that the ending of Homecoming set up.

Not only that, but MCU Peter doesn‚Äôt even get a good overcoming his grief plot, the literal only reason he doesn‚Äôt brutally kill Goblin is because Raimi Peter steps in at the last second, even after getting a giant talk from both Spidermen.

Only shining light in this muddled mess are the performances, especially Dafoe and Garfield., both of them elevate an incredibly weak script.",ri7eum
hp0yq5i,"Very entertaining but the movie has nothing without the nostalgia. 

The mcu curse of tone deaf jokes ruining emotional impact was all over this. Flash bragging about MIT after they all fail to get in, aunt mays death being followed by awkward Phillipino mom dialog(also her forced responsibility speech was lame). Harry's death in Sp3 becoming a punch line.

The whole plot itself is contrived, and I'm tired of Hollands Peter, who we are told is this mega genius(along with his friends) continuing to make dumb decision after dumb decision. Why on earth would he let the villains out of the prison AND show them his family, friends, and the box that leads to their salvation. 
Spiderman felt way more like spiderman when his phone broke and his two teenage friends weren't allowed to talk over him doing stuff.

Once again Dr. Strange, the guy who fought Thanos one on one, gets nerfed so he doesn't instantly solve the movie.

I loved seeing Tobey again, or watching William Dafoe smile while he gets punched in the face, or have Hannibal Burress tell spiderman he's a murderer, but this plot was a huge mess, and the even the end tease felt like a self aware moment where they said, ""ok NOW he's on his own and it will feel more like a spiderman movie. Now he doesn't have iron man or Dr strange or iron man again to drive the plot ""
But how many times is he going to learn to be responsible? He did in the first film with the suit, he did in the second film with the glasses, and now again? Sorry but this Peter is an idiot and I can't empathize with the contrived stupidity he has to have for these plots to happen.

The film was stilted with the comedy and dialog, way longer than it needed to be, and way too reliant on other films. Can anybody tell me a funny or cool original line from this movie? I can't.

hpehhe7,"Damn was I disappointed in this movie. I came into this movie with fairly moderate to high expectations and of course knowing that Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire would reprise their roles. But the movie is just too much of a mess for me to enjoy it. One of the big issues is a lack of a coherent story. There's too much going on, Aunt May's death, Spider-Man's secret identity being revealed, the new villains and trying to fix them and then finally the other spider-men appearing in the movie. A lot of plot threads ended up being under baked, Aunt may's death was poorly done, half of the villains end up doing nothing and Peter's identity being revealed was just an excuse for the multiverse villains to appear and rest of the plot to follow rather than being a real struggle for Tom Holland's peter parker. 


The second big issue is the portrayal of the returning/legacy characters. When Tobey and Andrew first appear, it's a huge moment but everything after that pales in comparison to their first appearance. Andrew ends up looking the best because he was always a good Spider-Man, charismatic, solid one-liners and his movements within the suit are all great. Tobey seems stiff in comparison because he was the best peter parker, all the quips, jokes and references  don't as work as well for him. How is he supposed to react to the joke about him shooting web fluid out of his dick? The other spider-men are really just glorified cameos stretched out so they can make every possible reference, joke and call-back possible. Admittedly they do provide mentorship to Tom Holland's Spider-Man but it feels weak with how little they appear in the movie and how most of their interactions are just jokes played for a joke and some fan-service. For the villains, Alfred Molina and William Dafoe gave great performances for what they were given. But they work a lot better in their own respective movies. The lizard had one good line and that's it. Electro was ret-conned and his ending was unsatisfying given  the origins of his character in TASM 2. Sandman's character was also assassinated in this movie.  

Third issue was the final fight. It was just bad, for lack of a better word, the action is hard to follow and electro is raping your eyeballs most of the time . I didn't mind the other actions scenes in the film. The highway, Dr Strange, condo fight scenes are all good, great in the case of Dr Strange but the climatic fight is just bad and redeemed by the fact that you get to see the three Spider-Man fight and that's it. 


That's not to say I didn't like parts of the movie, I nearly teared up when I heard Danny Elfman's theme  again and I generally enjoyed everything before Aunt May's death. But I don't think this is a film which will be looked so favourably on repeat watches and without the theatrical experience.",ri7eum
hpytmoy,Absolutely painful to sit through,ri7eum
hr7ghng,"Despite all the hype, this was just another bland MCU movie, which we've gotten too many of lately. Almost everything in the movie felt emotionally flat. The director failed to find the real humor or emotion in so many potential moments. The only really funny moment happened with Daredevil, who didn't even need to be in the movie. The absurdity of having three Spider-Men on screen could have led to so much good comedy (how about the famous three Spider-Men pointing at each other meme?), but what they do with the premise is mild, weak and obvious. One Spider-Man cracking another's back? That's not funny. And why do Tobey and Andrew spend so much time hugging each other? Multiple times we get the joke where the Spider-Men don't know how to refer to each other by name without getting confused. That's the best they could come up with? The Spider-Men spend most of their time explaining their backstories that the audience already knows. There could've been references to more of their popular lines added in (no ""I missed the part where that's my problem?""). The camera set-ups are very basic and don't make the three Spider-Man look interesting together. And, wow, pop culture references to two old TV shows dropped in out of nowhere. The MCU still hasn't figured out that's not funny?

Seeing Tobey and Andrew is great of course. It's a reminder of how good they were in their own ways at playing the character. The one bit of new information we get about their canon was intriguing. But their entrance was underwhelming. Just walking into an apartment through a portal isn't exciting. Ghostbusters: Afterlife knew how to give their returning heroes a real entrance. Both Spider-Men act so nonchalant about being stuck in another universe, like they had been doing this all their lives. The villains are given time to be shocked about it, but the Spider-Men aren't. Aren't they worried they'll never get back to see their loved ones again? Or that maybe everyone they know is actually dead? Remember how nervous Marty McFly was in Back to the Future when he went back in time to an unfamiliar world? These characters don't experience those natural emotions. I did like seeing J. Jonah Jameson reimagined as an internet blogger. That's a modernization to the canon that makes sense.

The big tragic moments fall flat, partly because the MCU Spider-Man characters don't have believable, convincing relationships. The final scene with Michelle Jones plays awkwardly and falsely. Jones sees a stranger creeping on her and instead of being weirded out, she starts crying? We can see how all this tragedy is just a plot contrivance meant to set up the next chapter in the Spider-Man saga. We even have to suffer through a long introduction about how Spider-Man's life is falling apart even though the trailer communicated the same information in 30 seconds. It's a complete waste of time. Never mind that the movie treats not getting into an ""elite"" school as one of life's ultimate tragedies. So much for sticking up for the value of the little guy in America, or acknowledging that some of our most successful people were college dropouts.

One good thing the movie surprisingly does is acknowledge every criticism that the MCU Spidey's biggest ""haters,"" like me, have had of the MCU Spidey, and acquiesce to every single one of them. They have genuinely waved the white flag of surrender to us haters, for which I am truly grateful. They retcon away Peter's status as Iron Man Jr., including his access to high tech suits, they wipe out his inaccurate supporting cast, they add in the tragedy and angst that is so essential to the original Spider-Man, they bring in the famous ""responsibility"" quote, and they turn Peter into an unsuccessful loner, restoring the character's classic underdog status. Much of this movie was spent undoing every single bit of establishment the MCU had done for its Peter Parker, changing him into being as close to comic-book accurate as possible, including giving him a fantastic classic-style costume at the end of the movie. To that I say, hurrah! This is exactly what I would've done if I was writing the script. But it is still a tacit acknowledgement of all the mistakes the MCU has made with Spider-Man up to this point. Why do they keep making the same mistakes, like when they gave Andrew Garfield a silly-looking suit in his first movie and then fixed it in his sequel? While we get most of these improvements at the end, we still have to slog through this movie on the way to hopefully enjoying a true, classic Spider-Man story in Tom Holland's fourth outing.

There wasn't one original thing in No Way Home. Everything was a reference to a past movie. The plot was completely contrived to lead to this giant retcon of the Tom Holland canon as well as countless fan service moments. Ghostbusters: Afterlife has nothing on this when it comes to fan service. This was the fan service movie to end all fan service movies. Scenes, characters, lines, plot points, everything from the past Spider-Man movies was referenced, rehashed, replayed or talked about. The villains go through their predictable beats. Doc Ock is bad before he's good. Norman pretends to be good solely as a ruse. Electro gets drunk on power, literally. But, somehow, he's good-looking now, a point which is acknowledged but never explained. This movie just wants what it wants, and logic be damned. Case in point, Sandman, again, has his character motivation all botched up. He has absolutely no reason to fight on the side of the villains here, because he acknowledges earlier in the movie that all he wants to do is go home. Sometimes the movie falls into flat-out plot holes. How does Doc Ock know Norman is the Green Goblin, when even Harry Osborn didn't know that until after Doc Ock was dead? One little bit of comic book fan service that is left unfulfilled here is having a true Sinister Six team. We come up one villain short of a full sextet. They couldn't find a way to work Vulture into the mix even briefly?

The plot very unwisely hinges on the heroes being very stupid. Dr. Strange shouldn't have had Peter in the same room with him if Peter had the ability to damage the spell. Peter knows these villains were so threatening to Spider-Man that they had to be killed, yet he thinks he can reform them? Even against the advice of a fellow hero who he knows has the best intentions of the universe at heart? Even after everything goes wrong with Peter's plan, and the murderous villains go on the run, he doesn't follow through with his backup plan to send them all back with Dr. Strange's device. When Uncle Ben died in the other Spider-Man canons, it was because Peter made a mistake which he then learned from. Here, he doesn't learn from his mistake, he keeps trying to do the same thing again after Aunt To-May's death. Learning that villains can't be reformed would've been an odd lesson to learn in a Hollywood movie, one from the Ayn Rand school of thought. But, nevertheless, this is the lesson the movie teaches, even if it fails to acknowledge that's what it did. Finally, when all Spider-Man's friends are about to forget who he is, why doesn't he think to film a video on their phones showing them together? Granted, this apparently wouldn't have worked, since all videos saying Peter was Spider-Man must've been erased. But the idea should've been acknowledged to make that clear.

The problematic plotting continues as these villains seem to only show up when the plot needs them to. They go on the loose, but don't seem to wreak any havoc or form any plan. Then, when Spider-Man asks them to show up and walk into his trap, they gladly do it. If they wanted to confront Spider-Man that badly, why did they run away from him in the first place without finishing him off?

The action in the movie just isn't that good. The bridge fight with Doc Ock is the best action scene in the movie. It's got the most trademark Spider-Man action, with lots of web shooter play. The big climax doesn't measure up. It's a lot of fast-cutting jumps and punches, without any clear sense of where the characters are in relation to each other. Sometimes the webs are strong enough to hold a monster, and sometimes a teenage girl can tear right through them like they were cobwebs. The scene where Tobey gets stabbed looks like it was originally meant to be a death scene, but was perhaps reshot to let him survive. The moment feels wrong and is resolved too quickly. He says he's been stabbed before? Spider-Man couldn't survive that kind of wound if the Goblin attacked him with an intent to kill.

In the end, the movie just seems to cave in to the idea that it was all a manufactured construction for fan service. We don't get any explanation of what will happen to the villains back in their own worlds, after they were ""cured"" in this one. Are they still doomed to their fates, or has the canon in the other universes been irrevocably altered? If the movie cared about its story, rather than just filling the movie with guest stars, it would have supplied us with that explanation.

No Way Home ultimately goes through a lot of machinations just to give us a story that seems to change nothing, other than erasing everything that the MCU has done with their Spider-Man up to this point. I have to acknowledge that it's brave for a successful film series to admit that everything it did was a mistake, and reset itself to please what seemed to be a minority of Spider-Man fans, including myself, who hated what they were doing. Maybe looking at those older, superior Spider-Man movies convinced them that they had taken the character too far in the wrong direction. I do hold out hope that, next time, the MCU will finally get Spider-Man right. But reworking the premise might not be enough. This director blew so many golden opportunities in this film that the series really needs a fresh voice at the top to lead it in a new and improved direction.",ri7eum
hovmw2q,"WHAT I LIKED

- TOBEY AND ANDREW ARE HERE!!!!! (and their performances are just as good!)

- William Defoe is a master at his craft. The Goblin felt just as menacing as Spider-Man 1 and his twisted fascination with Tom's Peter was awesome

- Regardless of his role, Alfred Molina didn't miss a beat. The look, his mannerisms....straight from Spider-Man 2

- Jamie Foxx's Electro surprised me in a good way. Felt like a natural progression for the character from Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Foxx used that opportunity to bring more charisma to the role

- Zendaya's ~~Mary Jane~~ Michelle Jones Watson was good and felt like a real person to me where as I thought she felt like a caricature in the last 2 movies

- The entire scene where the villains turn and it leads to May's death was awesome.

- The 3 Spider-Men shooting the shit on the scaffolding and in the science lab was what everyone wanted and I'm glad they delivered

- Octavios and Osborn having a scene together. Wanted to see that ever since I was a kid watching Tobey's movies on VHS. Loved it.

- Want me to crack your back?

- I liked the roles Sandman and Lizard had in this, I knew they'd be sidelined a bit but I was glad that their motivations still felt true to their characters

- Tobey's exchange with Octavious near the end was heart-warming.

- The ending was everything I've wanted from Tom Holland's Spider-Man. The soft-reboot has me very excited for the future of this Spidey, even though he's still my least favourite of the 3.

- Tobey and Andrew have great chemistry together. Would be down for a Spider-Verse movie led by them....or just them teaming up for another film.

- Matt Murdock...... 

WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE

- .....for half a minute. I'm assuming Marvel cut some of his scenes and they should feel ashamed.

- Doc Ock was wasted in this for me. He's taken out with....bluetooth?! When he's supposed to be in ""evil"" mode he never feels like a legit threat. Spider-Man 2's Doc Ock was a THREAT that had you questioning wether Peter could beat him. HE IS ONE OF SPIDER-MAN'S GREATEST VILLIANS! In this he was a punchline

- This take on J. Jonah Jameson does NOT work for me. Why make him some alt-right scam artist like Alex Jones?! The most interesting part about Jameson in the old movies and the comics is that underneath all that hate --  there's a good man. In this JJJ seemed intentionally evil and that's just not the character

- I'm glad Ned seems to be exiting these movies because good god I cannot stand him. His jokes just are not funny and actually disrupt both the plot and tone of these movies. Also he knows magic now? The hell? It took Strange months to learn that in his movie.

- Tom Holland changing Spider-suits every scene to sell toys. First he's in the Far From Home suit, then the gold/black thing, then the new integrated suit, then the new one at the end......

- The plot threads from the former MCU movies felt distracting. Like the writer's wrote themselves into a corner with the last movie and them jumped leaps and bounds to skip over the fallout with the first half-hour of this movie because they came up with a better idea. Would have helped the plot feel more focused if they dealt with that in an earlier movie and fully dedicated this one to the old villains and heroes.

- What the hell are they doing with Venom?! So damn confused",ri7eum
hp9ovyt,"Unpopular opinion, but when you put all 3 actors in the same movie, Andrew Garfield for me comes across as the best Peter Parker/Spiderman.

I felt like the movie fell flat in several regards: the emotional scenes were dull as compared to Raimi's trilogy, the lack in quality of the effects and suits was also very apparent, everything looked like a You Tuber's VFX project. 

I also found the lack of any character flaws to be a detriment to the character, Tom's Parker isn't impulsive, isn't immature, isn't anything really. Blander than Captain America. What is there to develop? Why should I find this character interesting? How would the character grow as a person beyond superficial improvements? The thing Peter regrets in this movie is him having too big of a heart and it backfiring, a fluke essentially. The whole characterization of the MCU Spider Man is stunted by studio cowardice, cowardice of a character actually having real, tangible flaws which they overcome.

I personally felt it was just okay. The movie was super fun, but it‚Äôs stuffed to the brim with fan-service to the point that Ned and MJ end up failing to get as much time as they deserved in this.

It felt like the movie attempted to do an endgame type thing without basically any of the prior set-up and the result is a confused movie that doesn‚Äôt know if it wants to be about Tom Hollands origin as ‚Äúthe friendly neighborhood Spider-Man‚Äù or about his relationship with his friends when it comes to these high danger situations. I don‚Äôt think they have to be mutually exclusive if it weren‚Äôt for the fact that Tobey and Garfield are the biggest emotional impactors on Holland.

hoveanu,"Just got out. What a ride. The best Holland film by a mile, and would probably put it above Spider-Man 3. The original two Raimi films are still the best in my mind, whether that be from nostalgia though, I couldn‚Äôt tell you.

Most people will more eloquently explain what they liked, and I stand by the vast amount of positive reception this film has gotten so far. 

I only have a few nitpicks, curious if anyone else feels similarly: 

‚Ä¢ the combat in these marvel movies is starting to show some issues to me. The fights feel floaty, and it is very hard to determine the type of damage, if any, the characters are taking. In the Raimi films, when Peter is hit, the camera would work in such a way that it would show impact, like Peter hitting walls. Also a lot more close up shots in those movies, showing Peter exhausted and in pain. This film, these characters are invincible unless their specified weakness is exploited. Takes away some tension. 

‚Ä¢ the tone is all over the place. The constant banter and attempts at humor really derail some of the more emotional scenes of the movie. I loved the dynamic of the three Peters, but beyond that I found the unrelenting wise cracks to be tedious. I also think that it hurts rewatchability (is that a word?). I get these movies are ridiculous in premise, but I don‚Äôt mind taking them seriously. I prefer it actually. Just a lot of lines that had me rolling my eyes.

All in all, really enjoyed it. Maybe the aspects of the films I mentioned above are just not targeted at me, a 30 something year old nerd, and I need to just accept it. Shrug.",ri7eum

hp0llln,"So the movie was fun, but had a bunch of problems.   


1. I was promised more venom. Venom said he was going to go eat spiderman. He got up, left his hotel room to find spiderman, and then sat at the hotel bar and got drunk for 12+ hours. (dr. strange was dangling on a cliff for 12 hours). 
2. Dr. Strange, the strategist who literally looked at every potential timeline to pick the best solution just a few movies ago, started this spell and had to restart it 5 times because he wouldn't take 30 seconds to plan it out or even fully explain it to Peter. That's very out of character for Dr. Strange.  

3. Dr. strange, the dude who handled the time stone with ease, messed up a spell that he uses to erase peoples minds after parties get out of hand because peter was talking to him. He's a surgeon. He's fuckin Dr. strange. He would not have messed this up.   
It should have been Loki, fiddling around trying to do research on the multiverse disguised as dr. strange. He's tries to help peter because he thinks dr. strange would. Poof, he screws up and runs off.  DR. strange shows up and tries to fix the problem.  You had the icy room (icy giant). the loki like hairstyle. The inadequacy (loki's new to time magic). It'd of tied the tv show into the movies, and would have made way more sense than Dr. Strange screwing up a simple spell and then blaming spiderman.   

4. Dr. Strange never said pressing the button would send them back. WTF does the button do?! That was a huge assumption on Spider groups part.  They should have pressed it only to find out it was a carjack alarm or something.   

5. the movie should have featured, venom as promised and the voice actor of the spiderverse spiderman as Miles Morales as a live action Miles.

The movie's plot made no sense and was completely predictable. The action scenes were  non-eventful except for the first battle with Dr. Octopus and the chase scene with Dr. Strange.

Overall, this film just felt really silly. I'd rank it among the worst MCU films.",ri7eum
hph9fxx,"5/10 for me. 

Story is built on top of Peter (and Strange) being an absolute moron and most of the movie makes pretty much no sense. It was designed to use nostalgia no matter how contrived (Electro didn't even know Peter was Spiderman).

To me though the worst part is how all the returning characters and villains feel so different. It genuinely felt that the writers didn't watch a single Raimi or Webb movie. Having Doc Ock say ""My machine... the power of the sun in the palm of my hand"" is such a mind boggling stupid and stunted line that has LITERALLY no reason to be said on the bridge. Electro was fundamentally different and Lizard was just a poor flanderization of his TASM version. Goblin was the only villain that felt similar but even then his Norman version was way dumber.

Doesn't help that Marvel loves to throw jokes into everything they can so each villain is made lesser due to being the butt of a joke. 

Also, having everyone in the Raimi verse know that Norman was Goblin was such a needless retcon I genuinely wonder what the thought process was. It didn't serve anything and only paints Harry in a worse light during Spiderman 2 because he'd have been openly avenging his evil father.

This doesn't even touch how uninspired the location variety was. It's so mundane how the villains are just shoved into an apartment or how Peter and Andrew just kinda show up in the kitchen. Did the writers really not think of more interesting places or scenarios?",ri7eum

Also too much cheesy fan service that just came off as cringey. Where were all these fans before this movie was even announced? Its like they came out of nowhere...

1) Tobey- very believable as awkward Peter Parker, but has an intense sincerity about him that is really wholesome. He is truly a good boy at heart. 

2) Andrew- perfectly encapsulates the more cocky and charismatic version of Peter/Spidey, and is most believable as a genius out of the three.

And I really hated how Strange was portrayed in the movie. May's death didn't hit me hard because I was weirded out by the fact she wasn't dead already while standing and still talking to Peter. It may be a weird nitpick, but how the fuck was she still alive at that point?

The only highlights for me, and to be fair they are pretty big highlights, were the villains and the other spider-men. The theater was clapping and cheering for every reveal from daredevil to tobey to venom. The only one that got me was the tobey reveal, almost got teary eyed. All scenes with the three spider-men together were amazing tho. At this point, however, i just don't really like tom's spider-man or peter parker, and having the other two next to him made it even worse.

- Electro is no longer schizophrenic for some reason.
- The Lizard didn't die in¬†*The Amazing Spider-Man*, his voice is supposed to be modulated in lizard form, and he seemed way more intelligent and articulate in this film. His motivation from that movie was also ignored.
- Doc Ock willingly sacrificed himself in a redemption arc, and he's suddenly evil again? And wants tritium again after deliberately giving up his dreams for the greater good?
- Why can't Sandman appear human anymore? Other than that, he was alright.
- The Green Goblin was way more cunning and intelligent in the 2002 movie, and he had actual motivations. Here, he seems to be a non-threat generic insane guy. He gets the drop on Spider-Man once and that's it. Tom Holland even effortless beats the crap out of him without a real fight. Anyone who saw¬†*Spider-Man*¬†(2002) knows that's bullshit. Even the suit seemed off somehow.
- Now that it's established Norman being the Green Goblin and killing himself was a news headline, Harry's revenge arc is retroactively hilarious. It also paints the butler scene from *Spider-Man 3* in a new light.
- Magic and the Avengers supposedly don't exist in the Raimiverse, yet Doctor Strange was mentioned in¬†*Spider-Man 2*. What?

I‚Äôd die on that hill.",ri7eum
howyb0c,"Ok so I know I‚Äôm in the minority on this, but I have to share these thoughts here: the movie was just ok.

I need to preface with the fact that I knew about every major secret going in to seeing this movie. I knew that Matt Murdock would show up, I knew that someone would toss a brick through the window and Matt would catch it, he would state, ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm a good lawyer,‚Äù when asked how he did it, and I knew that Tom and Andrew were going to show up in the movie as well.

I did NOT know about Aunt May‚Äôs death, and I did NOT know everyone would forget who Peter Parker was.

So I feel like a lot of these big surprise character reveals are part of what made the movie for some people, and I missed that. Part of me laments that I didn‚Äôt have the willpower to stay away from spoilers before the movie, but also I see it as me going into the movie as someone who knew what to expect. Like someone who‚Äôs doing a repeat viewing of a movie.

A movie shouldn‚Äôt just be good for it‚Äôs surprises, it should hold up no matter how many times you watch it. So taking that into account, and since I felt like I was watching the movie as a repeat viewer because I knew about all the amazing character reveals, I feel like I had the benefit of seeing it through a more level headed perspective. And while I was certainly glad to see all these characters onscreen in one movie (the majesty of this crossover is not lost on me by any means, the MCU and Spider-Man is forever changed form this movie) I‚Äôve gotta say it feels like the movie was using those reveals to carry this film into the 10/10 category so many fans are putting it in. But I just don‚Äôt see this movie as a 10/10 film.

And I have to mention this too, it‚Äôs bothered me since the second he showed up on screen: Tobey Maguire‚Äôs acting was‚Ä¶interesting in this movie. He was my Spider-Man growing up, he was the one I was most excited to see. But I felt myself enjoying Andrew Garfield‚Äôs presence onscreen more than Tobey Maguire‚Äôs. Which is something I didn‚Äôt think I would ever say! Maybe it‚Äôs just because he wasn‚Äôt under the direction of Sam Raimi or something, but he felt like a multiverse version of Spider-Man who looks like Tobey Maguire Spider-Man, but isn‚Äôt actually him. It was just off.

Andrew Garfield nailed it though. I didn‚Äôt like the Amazing Spider-Man movies very much but they certainly have their fans, and he might as well have filmed those movies yesterday for how much he stayed true to his original performance in No Way Home. Outstanding, for sure.

As for the villains, I felt they were acted very well! Alfred Molina is still an amazing actor and I‚Äôm upset that his Otto Octavius couldn‚Äôt shine more in the movie, but I‚Äôm happy with what I got. Except for the constant repeating of the Spider-Man 2 line, ‚ÄúThe power of the sun in the palm of my hand,‚Äù when referencing his machine, his goals, or the arc reactor. We get it. That was his character‚Äôs motivation when we saw him last. You don‚Äôt have to remind me every 38 minutes. Jamie Foxx‚Äôs Electro got a little more development and I actually cared for him in this movie, whereas I kind of didn‚Äôt in TASM2. The Lizard was‚Ä¶well, he was in like 3 scenes I guess. And Sandman, you can tell they were really struggling to give him any motivation in this movie. I like how they started out with him helping Spider-Man because the last time we saw him, he and (his) Spider-Man were on good terms. So it was neat for him to be like, ‚ÄúHey Spider-Man, let me help you fight this electricity guy and then we can figure out what‚Äôs happening!‚Äù But then he suddenly just got all angry and ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt trust Peter anymore‚Äù so he turns evil. And the whole movie he‚Äôs just like, ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm evil because I don‚Äôt trust you‚Ä¶and I have a daughter I wanna see‚Ä¶yeah‚Ä¶‚Äù (also he had no reason not to trust Peter. Everyone dies when they get sent back except for him because he never died in the Raimi trilogy, he had nothing to lose except his sand. And he cares more about his daughter than he does being sandy, so what‚Äôs his deal?). I‚Äôm just glad they didn‚Äôt swap out Thomas Hayden Church for someone else; I had to admit I was worried when I didn‚Äôt see him in any promotional material.

Then there‚Äôs the crown jewel of the villains, Willem Dafoe‚Äôs Green Goblin. He sure as hell was the main bad guy, and he sure as hell was evil, and got Damn were his fight scenes with Peter brutal as hell oh my god. But same as Doc Ock, I wish more attention was on him because he felt like he had more to give but couldn‚Äôt when there were 4 other villains.

This begs the question: do we need villains established in prior movies to have even more time to be fleshed out when they‚Äôre playing the exact same character from the exact same time? I‚Äôm of the opinion that yes, we do. We‚Äôre in a separate movie, with separate motivations and separate stakes from their original movies. So more time spent on the villains should have been incorporated. Where you fit that time into a movie that‚Äôs already 2 hours and 45 minutes long after the credits, is beyond me. So maybe they did the best with what they could, or perhaps there‚Äôs fat in the film that could have been trimmed.

Earlier I touched upon a line repeated from a past movie, the one from Spider-Man 2. That wasn‚Äôt the only one. We had the meme line done by Norman Osborn, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm something of a scientist myself,‚Äù that I couldn‚Äôt help but both roll my eyes at and smile with appreciation that hey put it in there. It took me out of the movie, made me aware that some dude who browses Reddit like us probably helped write the movie, but damn it I‚Äôm glad they took the opportunity.

Another repeated line is Aunt May‚Äôs version of, ‚Äúwith great power comes great responsibility.‚Äù When I first heard this line in the movie, I again rolled my eyes because I felt they were just putting this in for more Spider-Man nostalgia. But as the movie went on I was troubled to see that it actually was included for a worse reason, as 1) Tom Holland‚Äôs way to connect with Tobey and Andrew, and 2) Tom Holland‚Äôs rally call to get him to be motivated to keep going again and to do the right thing by curing all the villains. However I take umbrage with this, as 1) that line was supposed to be Peter‚Äôs rally call to use his powers to help others as a super hero in the first place, aka his reason for being Spider-Man at all, and 2) we already got a different version of this line 5 years ago with Spider-Man‚Äôs introduction into the MCU in Captain America Civil War (I believe it was ‚ÄúWhen you can do the things that I can do, and bad things happen, the bad things happened because of you,‚Äù which is essentially the exact same thing as ‚Äúgreat power, great responsibility‚Äù), which again he used as his reason for throwing on blue and red sweats and helping people in the first place. So why was this line significant in this movie? Why did Peter need it if he already knew it? It‚Äôs an inconsistency in the writing at best and a poor understanding of the character at worst, and you would think Marvel would be able to do better with Spider-Man.

Uh let‚Äôs see, I love what they‚Äôve done with Peter Parker in this movie. Brought him down to his absolute worst, and at the end of the movie he‚Äôs more isolated and alone than ever. And I love that about him. He‚Äôs got no Aunt May to run PR charity events for Spider-Man anymore or support him, he lost his best friend / guy in the chair so he has to work solo now, he lost his girl and has to get her to fall for him all over again, he has no more Stark tech for any of his suits or gadgets, he‚Äôs presumably got no Avengers connection at all actually now that I think about it, and he‚Äôs broke and fending for himself. He‚Äôs gonna be Peter Parker with money problems, girl problems, super hero problems, basically the Peter Parker / Spider-Man that a lot of us have been wanting to see in the MCU for awhile now. It‚Äôs set up to be this way and all Marvel has to do is retain their focus on what they‚Äôve done all of this for and we should be in for a really interesting next trilogy. Also, we didn‚Äôt get too good of a look at that new suit (at least I didn‚Äôt, the low light and the constant movement made it pretty hard for me to get more than a quick glance at it) but he‚Äôs back to the classic fabric red and blue suit, no iron spider, probabky no suit AI or Iron Man HUD. But what‚Äôs most important is how it looks, which from that quick glance I got I think it‚Äôs going to look stunning, and I can‚Äôt wait until we get a better look at that costume. Marvel‚Äôs Spider-Man: Remastered DLC costume maybe? Fingers crossed. Though if they make us wait for Marvel‚Äôs Spider-Man 2 I‚Äôll be upset but understanding.

Also there‚Äôs something to be said about how this movie totally just negates the last movie as setting up Spider-Man as the new leading Avenger, maybe, idk. I‚Äôm gonna watch FFH again with the context of NWH I have now and see if I can get anything else from it, maybe I missed the point entirely. I never claimed to be a genius after all lol.

Oh and the Ned using the sling ring, even though his precision and control were inconsistent to convey a low level of mastery was very uncool I thought. Remember how hard Doctor Strange had to practice just to get it to work? And then Ned does it by accident? Idk you can probably excuse it away with some bs but I don‚Äôt buy it, I didn‚Äôt like that they did that.

Anyway Jesus fuck I wrote a dissertation on this movie. Let me know if you agree, or how wrong you think I am. I absolutely HAVE to talk about this movie. I‚Äôm going to see it again Saturday night with some friends, and until then I‚Äôve got no one to discuss any of this with.

Thanks for reading!

TL;DR: Movie was pretty good tbh I‚Äôd watch it again and I think it was a good way to conclude this movie trilogy, a good way to set up the next trilogy, and was a good inclusion to the MCU overall. Though I did have some criticisms. 7.5/10",ri7eum

hoy5wco,"The first two Tobey Maguire movies I walked out thinking, ""I liked those."" The third one I left thinking, ""Not great, but it's Spider-Man.""

Both Andrew Garfield movies I walked out thinking, ""There were some terrible things in those, but some great moments that made me like them.""

The first two Tom Holland movies I left again saying, ""I liked those.""

This is the first time I've ever left a Spider-Man movie thinking, ""THAT was a Spider-Man story!""

The one thing I was missing from Tom Holland's portrayal of both Peter Parker and Spider-Man was how he never really dealt with death on screen, especially when we saw it so viscerally with Maguire and Garfield. I'm glad we skipped the whole origin, but it would've been nice to see at least something before Civil War. Then when Tony Stark died, it's like, he was sad, but everyone else was WAY sadder. I didn't really get sad about Aunt May in the moment because I was too busy being so excited about seeing Tom Holland's performance of finally dealing with death, a key part to Peter Parker/Spider-Man's whole being. And then when everyone was made to forget, he has gone from dealing with hardly any loss to dealing with more than anyone ever has. AND IT WAS ALL ON SCREEN. This movie had everything that Spider-Man is.

And just as a fan, Andrew Garfield saving MJ was a moment that hit me so profoundly as a Spider-Man fan (and one who Gwen Stacy is the personal favorite of). Even though they made the circumstances of Gwen's death different in TASM2 in regard to Spider-Man's actions, I still thought it was a great Spider-Man moment. That and then leading to him saving MJ was the one moment where I fully broke into tears. Such a fantastic piece of cinema and storytelling and acting in that scene.

When Dr. Strange is first putting together the spell before it goes wrong, I thought it was a spell to make everyone forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man, not who Peter Parker is altogether. The exceptions that Peter wanted were just so his friends/family didn't forget he was Spider-Man since he didn't want to explain it to them again.

But in the end the spell that Dr. Strange uses to fix the multiverse rifts makes everyone forget that Peter Parker even exists. If Aunt May wasn't dead she wouldn't even know who Peter was, just like MJ and Ned and Happy. So it's a more extreme spell, right, not the one that Dr. Strange was originally going to cast? I thought they were just going to cast the original spell without exceptions but it doesn't seem like that's what happened.

It's weird to have a world were people literally don't know who Peter is. What happens to him in old photos? What happens if he goes to school or class and nobody has any idea who he is?

hq4td99,"I can't say I hated this movie (and maybe I would have liked it more if I had more familiarity with the other movies/Marvel itself), but the only redemption here is the character's performance, which I thought was spectacular and really brought out the emotional weight of the idea that ""with great power comes great responsibility"".  But the plot is egregiously and inexcusably contrived.

To summarize, Peter, MJ, and Ned are all applying to colleges, and are apparently convinced that they're all going to MIT together‚Äîbecause, you know, everyone gets in.  But in the last movie, Peter was revealed to the world to be Spiderman, and accused of being a killer, so even though he escapes police custody just by hiring a good lawyer, that's too much controversy for MIT to handle (and so too are his friends).  Apparently, this controversy is the only thing stopping MIT from accepting literally everyone.

But Peter, who has become the most famous man in the world, desperately needs that MIT prestige to complete himself, and feels bad for his friends, who, of course, would have had no problem getting into MIT without him.  So, following the natural progression of his maturity, he decides to try to alter the fabric of spacetime to restore his MIT admission.  Honestly, if you've ever been to A2C, that part might not be too far off.  But one expects Dr. Strange, the boss figure, to act as the adult in the room.  Instead, he gives in, and casts a spell meant to wipe the memory of Peter from the world.  But Peter hadn't really thought it through and realized that it would be awkward to have to reveal himself again to the people he loves, so he keeps modifying the spell parameters, which somehow makes it extremely dangerous.  Apparently, the risk of that danger was not enough to stop Dr. Strange from working to reverse a few college decisions.  So anyway, he realizes that the spell isn't working, so he contains it, but elements of the spell slip through, and somehow draw anyone who knows that Peter Parker is Spiderman from different universes to that one.  I'm not sure what the logic there is, but whatever.

Then, Spiderman resorts to Plan B, which is asking MIT to reconsider.  Thankfully, it's pretty easy for him to find someone, because a more distant friend (distant enough to get in) had just been at one of those mixers that colleges in different cities throw for new admits the very day the mail arrives, so he tells Peter that the Vice Chancellor is on her way to a flight.  That's when the first previous villian shows up, who wrecks havoc and ends up knocking the chancellor's car off a highway.  Spiderman catches it, but is grabbed by the villian's tentacles.  The villain gets ready to kill him, but hesitates because it's not the Peter he recognizes.  And unfortunately, he made the horrible mistake of... leaving the tentacles on his suit open to outside connections (rookie mistake I guess).  So Spiderman pairs his suit, takes control, and saves everyone.  The chancellor, not really caring that Spiderman likely brought about that chaos in the first place, decides that since Spiderman saved her, she can somehow force admissions to reverse some decisions.  Mission accomplished.

Now all Spiderman has to do is clean up the mess he made along the way by sending the visitors home.  Luckily, all it takes is one zap and Dr. Strange can put them behind a totally impenetrable barrier!  He gives Spiderman that ability and tells him to go find them, so he does, but along the way, his aunt convinces him that these people are worth saving.  Dr. Strange has a ruin that will send them home, but their fate was to die.  Dr. Strange tries to be the adult he failed to be beforehand, telling Spiderman that altering the fabric of timespace and risking unthinkable consequences is still not an option.  Spiderman won't take that, so he steals the ruin and fights Dr. Strange, who transports him into a universe that he fully controls.  But Peter recognizes Archimedes Spiral, so all it takes from there is rambling about dividing by pi and suddenly, he's tied up and trapped in Spiderman's webs by the power of high school math.   Unfortunately, his seemingly limitless abilities especially in that universe do not extend to breaking through some webs.  Spiderman also steals his magic ring, which gets transferred to Ned during a handshake.

So Spiderman tries to use some kind of technology to undo the villains' transitions.  It works for one of them, but then the rest of them decide to stop the process, killing the aunt in the ensuing fight.  Meanwhile, MJ and Ned become distressed that they haven't heard from Peter, and as they wish they could see him, Ned's new ring opens a portal, and they bring a couple of Peters through‚Äîjust not from their dimension.  MJ and Ned track their Spiderman and introduce the two new Spidermen, who decide to concoct cures for villainy and lure the villains, setting the stage for a fight between the previous villains and multiple iterations of Spiderman, seemingly, the whole point of the movie since the rest of the plot was painfully unthoughtful.

The fight happens and the rune to transport everyone back home is destroyed, causing the initial spell to be released and the sky to break as an infinite supply of villains pursue Peter Parker.  Dr. Strange escapes from his dimension during it, and Spiderman convinces him to put out an unmodified version of the spell to cause everyone to forget his identity (Dr. Strange, at first, didn't want to do that and was instead content to literally break the universe to avoid jeopardizing Peter's future at MIT with his friends).  He promises his friends that he'll return and explain everything.

So with his mess finally clean, he returns to re-introduce himself to MJ and Ned.  MJ is bandaged, a relict from the chaotic fight that had just ensued where she had been bleeding.  Peter makes the tough decision to not re-introduce himself after all, because he doesn't want that instability in her life, even though when she had it she made it abundantly clear that she did not want that tradeoff.  I guess it was supposed to be touching, but there's an obvious, gaping plot hole that the spell was stated to only alter people's memories (the whole point was that it could not touch spacetime), so there still should have been abundant, undisturbable physical evidence, and the fact that MJ is bandaged demonstrates that Peter/Spiderman's physical influences were, indeed, not totally removed.  So there should have been an MIT letter stating that they were too controversial, tons of pictures and texts, etc.  Not to mention the mass physical media.  That doesn't matter as far as closing off the multiverse, but it means that MJ and Ned and the rest of our universe forgetting Peter should have lasted for... maybe a few seconds before they figured it out again.  Even if the spell does remove physical evidence, Peter's extensive knowledge of MJ, Ned, and other loved ones (which is even more explicit) should have been proof enough‚Äîin the end, he decides not to try, but he could have just allowed the unmodified spell and used that from the very beginning.  If I had to guess, the answer here is that Marvel wanted MJ and Ned separated from Peter, and didn't particularly care if it made no sense whatsoever.

The characters pull off this garbage plot exceedingly well.  That emotional weight is even more magnified for more passionate Marvel fans, with scenes like another Spiderman rescuing MJ in an identical scene to that where that Spiderman had lost his own girlfriend.  But Marvel can do better than that utterly ridiculous plotline.  The movie really loses something here and performances can only compensate so much (although I do think maybe my view that plot is the most important part of a movie leaves me in a minority, even though I personally can't quite understand how people see otherwise).  I'm not disappointed that the movie sucks‚Äîit doesn't‚Äîbut that Marvel could have made a spectacular movie and chose to make an okay-at-best one by deciding on a climax before the rest of the plot and then failing miserably to find a reasonable storyline that could evoke the empathy this movie should earn.",ri7eum
hu23rkz,"I personally did not enjoy this movie. Although it had some great lines (I¬¥m somewhat of a scientist myself) and wholesome moments like when all three spidermen were on screen, I feel like it was like every other superhero movie with nothing special. The dramaturgy was a little basic and the pacing was weird (that might have been because there was too little time for the intricate story with so many characters). I also felt like when Peter suggested that everybody should forget him it felt very forced. Also Tobey should have gotten more screen time because he is undoubtedly the best spiderman. A lot of my friends think this is a 10/10 movie and the best spiderman movie ever. My question is what makes this movie a 10/10 best spiderman movie. What was the part where you felt like this was better than the other spiderman movies. What makes it special?",ri7eum

It‚Äôs the darkest and most mature Spiderman film to date in the MCU and it‚Äôs heart is on par with Spiderman 2 (Raimi) and may even surpass it. Everyone gives it their all performance wise (Dafoe and Holland are absolute stand outs) and Jamie Foxx recoups what was one of the worst takes on a comic book character ever with his new take on Electro for the film. 

The fan service is warranted and actually feels necessary for the plot to progress and culminate how it does. The first 30 minutes can be shaky, especially if you aren‚Äôt that big of a fan of the MCU Spidey flicks so far, but once it hits its stride and kicks into high gear its like a roller coaster you never want to end.

I recognised those eyes rightvaway and when he took the mask off and it was Andrew? The tears started running down my face. I could honestly say that this happened for anything and everything Andrew did. Him saving MJ was the absolute chefs kiss here too. 

Seeing Tobey again felt so weird to me considering how big of a part his Spider-Man played in my childhood. Hell, he got me into Spider-Man in the first place and so I was so happy to see him here too. 

The acting performances in this movie too across the board were nothing short of exceptional. Willem Dafoe stole the show and really tugged on my heartstrings as the weak and lost man. But then the Goblin reveal was nothing short of excellent and he was such a detestable villain. And holy fuck his fights with Holland were incredible and VERY physical. Garfield for me was a very close second and then Holland right behind him. The emotions pouring out of Andrew was the precursor that made me tear up every time he did something.

This movie easily eclipsed Endgame for me and that's because Tobey and Andrew were my Spidey throughout my childhood and teenage years respectively and so there was a lot riding on this for me. But now we had some finality for Andrew and Tobey, Holland has developed into his own incredible Spidey, we'll no doubt see Miles Morales on the big screen some day too. 

And if you look even further than that, you have Peter and Miles in the PlayStation Spider-Man games and they're equally as incredible. But you also have Miles and Gwen alongside Miguel in Spider-Verse and I feel it's very safe to say that my favourite super hero of all time is in very good hands for the future.",ri7eum

hovv4i1,"I really enjoyed how they blended everything together for the film. Asides from just seeing the characters interact, one thing I thought was cool was bridging some of the technology. While science/technology is a huge aspect in all of the films, I just thought it was a nice way to demonstrate what each universe had to offer. The biggest thing here was with all of Tony's tech and how that was eventually able to help them & how the arc reactor was used, but also, the others in terms of the serum for both Green Goblin/Osbourne and the Lizard. Another thing I liked was how Toby's Peter Parker just had the suit under his regular clothes - nothing fancy but just is. 

Using the music and re-introducing the old themes was great, and I think this hit me in a bit of an unsuspected way. It doesn't feel so much like nostalgia necessarily but like...almost makes your heart ache, haha. I think it's been awhile since I've felt the ""heart"" from a Spider-Man film because you know about the sacrifices Peter Parker has had to make and it's hard not to feel that sense of bittersweetness and empathy for the character. 

Overall, I really enjoyed it. As much as it was 'fan service' I think they really tapped into the heart of the character (not just through Holland, but just everyone). It was nice to have a film not necessarily tied to the MCU in a way that some of the other MCU films got when trying to tie them in with the Avengers. I mean, I do get that this is tying into the multiverse but it still feels a lot more separate in terms of how the narrative/story played out. I also think it benefited greatly from the fact that no new character really needed to be introduced; we all know their history in some capacity from a prior film (or films) and so jumping into those dynamics felt a lot smoother than if it was an entirely new villain.

Any ways, great film. Definitely a top one for me.",ri7eum

hovzted,"I‚Äôm a lifelong Spider-Man fan, comics and all, so I‚Äôm more nitpicky than the average viewer. I‚Äôve had A LOT of issues with MCU Spider-Man, particularly after Homecoming. This movie corrected ALL those issues. No iron man, complete focus on Spider-Man themes, characters, and issues.  May‚Äôs death was sad but perfect, her death is like that of Gwen and other characters, the kind of death that Peter can internalize as being his fault. And lastly the movie ended with such an amazing status quo for Peter. Broke college student in a crappy apartment. THAT is my Spider-Man. It‚Äôs what made me fall in love with Tobey‚Äôs version despite his more meek personality vs the comics, his version captured the themes and status quo of the character more than any and Tom‚Äôs version is continuing that

Now some more thoughts regarding the multiverse

I fucking loved it. Fan service? Sure. Still amazing. This was a love letter to 20 years of movies. If into the spider-verse was about what it means to be Spider-Man, this was about what it means to be Peter Parker

Tobey Maguire is the Spider-Man I grew up with, and I continue to believe his movies were the best overall with the best written Peter and villains. But Andrew‚Äôs performance in this movie reinforces the opinion I‚Äôve had the last few years: he‚Äôs the best Spider-Man performer by far. He stole the show this movie. His self deprecating humor and clear grief over Gwen was so endearing, and he‚Äôs the most charismatic of them all capturing Spidey‚Äôs trademark wit the best

Tobey had this great weary elder statesmen thing going on. Tobey‚Äôs Peter has always been an awkward but endearing guy, and he was great here. Always looking to lift up the other two spideys. Calling Andrew amazing, stopping Tom from succumbing to rage like he did.

Think this movie will end all the toxic debates in the fandom about who‚Äôs best. Despite this being a Tom Holland movie, this film did the smart thing and didn‚Äôt try to convince audiences he was the best or anything. It showed the merits in each version and how at the end of the day, they‚Äôre all Peter Parker, and they‚Äôre all Spider-Man

hovzz43,"Enjoyed most of it. Didn't enjoy that they went with the Brand New Day memory wipe.

First half of the movie was a little messy where everything just happens so fast but then the next hour and a half is just bonkers, wow.

Daredevil showing up omg.

And then when Andrew and Tobey came in, goosebumps. 

Willem Dafoe absolutely killed it (all of they did) but he was on another level. Same with Andrew Garfield, another acting masterclass.

And finally what I've been complaining about was remedied. A true Peter Parker without all the Stark suits and gadgets.

The only thing is that MAy's death didn't impact me. I think it's because she didn't have a big role like the original Aunt May who had so many great lines and monologues? Like she was just always there and in fact more like a hot object for us to look at which is wrong",ri7eum

I'm already thinking of plot holes and such, but none of them are bringing me down. It's a 10/10 cinema experience for fans of the character or the MCU - I think it tops Endgame for absolutely nailing all its elements.

The critic in me knows that it's not a 10/10 film, but as a pure experience this was possibly the best I've ever had in a cinema.

Only disappointment was Matt Murdock not getting a second scene or suiting up, but what a great cameo.

So happy none of it was spoiled for me (I had only heard rumours of Alfred Molina returning and the denials from Tobey and Andrew) so all of the twists and reveals were thrilling and surprising.",ri7eum

how73lq,"So what exactly did the spell at the end of the movie do? I'm still a little confused about it, did it alter memories basically making it so everything still kind of happened just without Peter there? How is everyone's perception of recent events now? Did it alter the physical world? Cuz even if memories are gone there's still evidence like pictures and videos and stuff of Peter out there correct? 

I'm assuming a lot of The avengers would still be there for Spider-Man because they would have remember working with Spider-Man they just wouldn't know who Peter was

Also was this spell just for Earth or was it cast through the universe? Because if it was just Earth that can be plot points there too

Also the spell just made everybody forget Peter? Like he wasn't wiped out of existence so to speak just nobody knows him, like his ID and everything still valid right? I know I'm asking some weird questions but it just got me thinking lol

It just seems like a sad ending and a harsh way to end it with nobody no one who Peter is, I see from a company standpoint why Sony wanted to do it just in case things with marvel/Disney goes sour they can pretty much keep making movies with Tom and pretty much can take the character anywhere now because he has no ties to the universe and nobody knows who he is",ri7eum

howcvre,"Saw it two days ago so I've had time to think about a few things

* I don't know about anyone else, but I was disappointed with this new version of Jameson. Not that J. K. Simmons didn't do a good performance, but it occured to me that the character just isn't that entertaining when he doesn't have people to bounce off of. He was one of the best parts of the Raimi trilogy and it was really because of his interactions with Peter and his staff. When he's on his own, he's not nearly as fun to watch.

* I found it odd that Lizard and Electro never mentioned Oscorp considering that it played a big part in their transformations. Also, their version of Norman Osborne was on his deathbed. Must have been weird for them to meet this 'Norman Osborne' who is both alive and healthy but also looks completely different. Guess they thought it wouldn't have worked in the script?

* Another omission (but also understandable) is that Tobey's Peter doesn't acknowledge that Andrew's Dr. Connors is a supervillain. The Connors in his own was a normal wholesome science teacher. Not really much point in making a big deal of it, but still. Wonder what he thought about that.

* In the UK, in my experience anyway, people don't really cheer or make noise in the cinema besides laughing. People didn't cheer during my screening of Endgame. But there was definitely a bunch of people who did when Andrew took his mask off. Normally I'd be annoyed, but... I don't blame them, I was grinning from ear to ear.

* I felt that Lizard and Sandman were a *liiiitle* underused. Also, howcome Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church didn't get in the main credits? J. K. Simmons too.",ri7eum
howcw6m,"One of the best Spider-Man movies ever. Spider-Man: No Way Home is a fanservice galore fest done extremely well with jokes, emotion, and heart added to the mix. Not only giving closure to so much of Spider-Man‚Äôs character, but also for the fans who always wondered how certain things would play out if they happened. This is a movie you need to witness.

Picking up right off from Spider-Man: Far from Home, the film gets straight into action with dealing on consequences and trying to amend outcomes. In some ways similar to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, the film stays interesting from scene after scene and never misses a beat. Solid action set pieces and character interactions give the film a lot of fun things to work with, and by the end everyone was clapping and cheering.

Without major spoilers, No Way Home will please most people who are familiar with all the previous Spider-Man films. I got a little emotional and attached when certain characters popped up again and I definitely didn‚Äôt feel the movie was a quick-in cashgrab at all. The performances were all really good, the special effects were top notch, and some of the music will be familiar to the fans.

In the end, it proves Marvel can still pull off a really entertaining yet rewarding movie for Spider-Man fans. Some minor criticisms I have is there are a few contrivances and maybe some characters could have gotten a bit more screentime, but in the end I had such a blast with what the movie set out to do. No Way Home will probably be my favourite film of 2021. 8.5/10",ri7eum

Tobey and Andrew talking about losing there loved ones and  Andrew talking about how he dealt with Gwens death  hit hard. I‚Äôm so happy that tobey was the one to stop Tom from killing goblin and Andrew saved mj. Tom Holland spider man really came out of his shell in this one. I still can‚Äôt believe this movie is real it felt like I was watching some high quality fan fiction. I also like how goblin killed may the same way he killled himself. Im really looking forward to seeing Tom in a new trilogy cause that ending was so sad. He has to deal with mays death by himself even happy doesn‚Äôt know who he is and that stung for me. Overall an amazing film.

Plus that cameo and post credit scene wow,ri7eum
howfpok,"I think this movie is tied with Spider-Man 2 for the best Spider-Man film imo. Not because of the cameos or the callbacks, but due to how much it's willing to beat the absolute crap outta Peter and to the point where he's alone and defeated in a way by the end. This is what Spider-Man has always been in the comics, a broke, down on his luck kid who always keeps moving forward no matter what he has to sacrifice or go through.

Sony got a lot of flaks for their marketing choices (and they should, especially for the posters), but the decision to keep the secrets was a genius one.

Given how stuffed this film is with characters and plot, they could've easily went down that road. 


But hats off to director Jon Watts, writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers and everyone who was involved in the creative process for putting together a film that was far from an unwatchable mess. A film that covered an insanely wide range of emotions, making me laugh and cry while giving me goosebumps all at the same time.

Andrew Garfield is incredible in this film and stole every scene he was in. Absolutely did his character justice

Characters from the Raimi trilogy felt like caricatures of themselves. It felt less like they had come from an alternate universe and more like they‚Äôd been pulled from a film *within the universe of the movie*. They kept repeating lines they said once or twice in the original trilogy and ugh it felt incredibly pandering and too self aware at times, they didn‚Äôt feel like real people and I think the writers didn‚Äôt totally understand their characters

I‚Äôm glad Tom Hollands Spider-Man finally got his uncle Ben moment with Aunt May, as well as the whole great power comes with great responsibility thing. Finally makes him feel like a more traditional character, and Aunt Mays death was definitely shocking and I legit didn‚Äôt see it coming. It was very well done

Overall I‚Äôd give this film a 7/10, it‚Äôs an incredibly fun film and seeing it opening day at the cinema was a great experience, the crowd was going nuts at points which is really uncommon for UK crowds. Even Endgame didn‚Äôt bring out such emotional responses in people imo. But the thing is this is a film which is probably a lot more fun on your first watch and doesn‚Äôt have as much rewatch value just because of the crowd pleaser moments, much like endgame and infinity war. But I guess that‚Äôs just the marvel formula",ri7eum

- Garfield and Maguire got an opportunity to continue their stories that didn't materialize from the cancelled sequels. Garfield's Spidey got a bit of emotional closure and Maguire's one has found a happy life balance with Mary Jane.  
- Dafoe and Molina effortlessly came back to the roles like they'd just played them yesterday.  
- They did a great job of showing off just how strong the Goblin really is. The original certainly demonstrated that but given every threat we've seen Tom fight, you see the Goblin could match it with most of the Avengers.  
- Just had a big smile on my face most of the movie. The 3 of them together, all the villains back and Charlie Cox is officially back too.",ri7eum

I was certain that Tobey's SM was going to die prior to the film. It's ashame that May had to die but that's comics for you.

howkw9v,"There are already thousands of comments and I know nobody will ever read this or care, but I just feel like I have to get my thoughts out before I can fall asleep tonight.

First thing's first: I loved it. I thought it was incredibly well done. As soon as it finished, I walked into the next screening and did it all over again.

This was definitely the best example of fan service I've ever seen in a movie (Star Wars and Ghostbusters, take note). In both screenings, the audience whooped and hollered when Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire showed up, and right on cue, I teared up both times. It reminded me of the ""on your left"" moment from Endgame where everyone in my audience cheered. As someone who has watched all the Spidey adventures in theaters on opening day, it was very gratifying to give these characters their due and send them off in such a respectful, full-circle moment. All the bantering in the lab and trading quips during the State of Liberty scene was incredibly satisfying, as was watching all the Spider-Men hug each other at the end (literally tearing up again just remembering it).

That being said, this film did have its problems. The main one not even being with the film itself, but all the marketing and hype leading up to it. There was just literally no surprises in it for me. We knew all the villains that would be returning (no surprise ones showed up), and everyone was already expecting this film to canonize all the other films, which naturally led everyone to speculate that Tobey and Andrew would return (not to mention the overarching multiverse plot, which conveniently makes it all possible). Like [Kimmel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBDIH6Qm4Yo) said a few nights ago, there would be a Capitol-style insurrection if they weren't in this movie. We were all already expecting it.

The one plot point I wasn't expecting got ruined for me yesterday in a random comment on a random website that had nothing to do with Marvel, superheroes or Spider-Man. The comment I read was in all caps and went thusly: >!AUNT MAY DIES IN THE NEW SPIDER-MAN!<. I'll never understand why some people in this world are so fucking awful they just want to ruin everything for everybody. That was the one twist that would have totally caught me off guard, and so now I was completely expecting it. Again, not an issue with the film per se, but the nature of the beast with these giant tentpole films.

If I'm nitpicking, the whole thing with Peter Parker opposing Dr. Strange is a bit of a stretch. I think the fact that Strange humored him for so long (""make the world forget me so my life can go back to normal and my friends can go to college"") is a bit ridiculous, considering all the consequences that would come from it. Also, the fact that Strange tells Parker that everyone in his life will forget him AS HE'S CASTING THE SPELL is so dumb. Why couldn't they have had a full conversation about it beforehand? Why wouldn't Strange have already anticipated that, at the very least, the Avengers would still remember who he is? Why did it have to be all or nothing? Yes, it's a very whiny point and the film wouldn't be possible without it. I can forgive these huge plotholes because the film was so fun and entertaining.

So where does that leave Spider-Man at the end of this film? I don't really understand how this ""forget he ever existed"" thing works. So no one has ever met Peter Parker before? All the years at school and everything? Is there just a big hole in their memory where he would be? When Strange casts the spell on top of the Statue of Liberty, all Peter had to do was just stay there instead of swinging away. They would have gotten their memories erased and then saw him standing there in the Spidey suit and he could have explained everything right then and there. Did they not wonder how they ended up on top of that platform? How does MJ think she got that scar on her head? Goddammit, you just can't apply logic to these movies or it takes all the joy out of it.",ri7eum
howkwpl,"The white cain came into view and the cinema erupted.

So many times during the film people cheered and clapped, most electric film i have ever seen.",ri7eum
howlbw6,That piece of venom symbiote left by Venom was the cherry on top I never knew I needed. I'm excited for Tom's black suit phase and it is very applicable since he just lost everything.,ri7eum
howllzu,"I‚Äôm stun about the level of storytelling. Wrapping up so many layers in such an elegant way. Rebooting to an origin story and naked superhero for one that has casually went for several movies and in a center position, no less. brilliant.

As always, I‚Äôll accept anything if the story is nice. Absolute respect for the writers.

Second thing I liked, is how I got baited into a build up, from a light and fun tone at each step, like a one off story, to a darker tone with larger implications. Aunt May for fucks sake, I didn‚Äôt see it coming.

I felt in the end the whole Spider-Man curse: his life is gonna be shit, never really pulling off a form of happiness",ri7eum

howokwu,Can we talk about Tom Holland Spider-Man in the astral plane. How he was able to move his body. Did anybody else catch the SPIDER SENSE ( visual around Peter‚Äôs face )when he was in the Astro form,ri7eum
howp2qe,"The scene right after Aunt May‚Äôs death was just brilliant. The purple aura and the fallen bag, the rain, Parker watching his character be dissected by JJJ into nothing but a criminal - the environment and the ambience was both gorgeous and so, so sad. 

This movie really sits above all for me. Watching Garfield come in the way he did and Tobey, and witnessing how all three characters interacted with each other was just euphoric. 11/10.",ri7eum
howp9ps,"I don't think it could have been written better.

Plenty of nods to the other Spidey films, continuity was tight, Andrew's redemption saving MJ was beautiful, the villains were great and didn't necessarily outshine each other or make it feel crowded (ala Spider-Man 3), it introduced Matt Murdock to this universe in an organic way, Tobey alludes to a great life with Mary-Jane without giving away too much (teasing for future instalments of some type of media), humour was present but didn't feel shoe-horned in and the emotions ranged from delight to shock to sadness to nostalgia.

I loved it.",ri7eum
howpxan,Now we need a Miles Morales trilogy,ri7eum
howrgs4,"That final scene with Peter swinging through NY in that beautiful suit was extremely well done. If the next trilogy, or movie even can capture some of that that magic, it‚Äôll be the best Spiderman put out.",ri7eum
hows0eq,"Loved Molina as Doc Oc, he just brings so much gravitas to the part. Aunt May hit hard, but Spider man needs that push. I thought Tom Holland did a great job and showed a different side tp the character. I loved Andrew and Tobey. Andrew did a really good job playing the spiderman who had everything go wrong, I liked the low self esteem and his sense of humour. Tobey did great as the wise, middle aged hero. Everyone killed it. I like that they've set MCU spidey up to be just a normal local level hero again. Dafoe killed it as well. All the villans did. Electro got a much better turn of things in this film as well. Not a top tier MCU film  IMO (Endgame, Infinity War, Guardians 1, CAWS, Ragnarok) but a solid B+. Also, really hyped for Strange MOM now. Strange Supreme!",ri7eum

I wasn‚Äôt sure before I saw the movie because I had read some of the leaks, but after seeing how the actual diner scene unfolded, I‚Äôm almost positive MJ will be back. Why else would they have her wear the Black Dahlia necklace; a necklace that, mind you, she obviously doesn‚Äôt remember how she got it or who gave it to her, but still wears it regardless? I feel like they weee trying to hint that MJ was intrigued by Peter; especially that last shot of her watching him walk out the door. 

& I mean, Peter did promise her (and Ned) that he was gonna find her again and fix everything. Granted, he didn‚Äôt give her the note he had written, but maybe he just felt like it wasn‚Äôt the right time to do so. I just think Sony/Marvel would be absolute idiots to not bring her back. I mean, she‚Äôs Zendaya. Who could be better?",ri7eum
howxw2r,"So many things to love about this (and a few plot conveniences, but those don't really matter).

Some random thoughts


I hadn't clocked that Holland hadn't had his with great power speech yet, I assumed we just didn't want another one of those (oh boy did we want another one of those)

I re-watched Spiderman 2 a couple of days before this, and I kinda feel Doc oc was a bit off on this one. Way too goofy, but eh

Did anyone notice other villains in the sky when the multiverses were opening apart from Kraven and Rhino?

The ""it doesn't hurt anymore"" line absolutely killed me and having an all alone Peter Parker will be interesting

Second post credit scene annoyed me - as I don't watch trailers anymore for spoiler reasons

I wonder how far down the writing process this movie was when into the spiderverse came out, as I feel the overwhelming acclaim that movie got enabled them to do this.

There were a couple of spectacular shots in this movie. One when Holland is swinging towards the woods to find electro, awesome wide. The second when all three spideys are perched in their signature stances, chef's kiss

Can't wait to rewatch this",ri7eum

hox0lp5,"So I‚Äôm in the minority here but I think Peter lost too much at the end. I think people should still remember Peter Parker, just not that he‚Äôs Spider-man. It can cost him his relationship with MJ and Ned can go to MIT, but it‚Äôs weird he has absolutely no identity and has to take GED courses. Like, when you start thinking about it having no identity, the fact that there is no Peter Parker recorded anywhere, causes a lot of logical problems for Peter. 

I think the reality is he was put in this position so if Spidey is ever removed from the MCU, it can be easily brushed off. No one will be asking where Peter is during a huge battle. Potts/Happy won‚Äôt awkwardly ignore his existence. FFH potentially left a huge unresolved cliffhanger in the MCU if Spidey didn‚Äôt come back, and it seems like going forward Feige and crew are not risking that again. I do hope in the sequel some of the supporting cast remember Peter, because as much as everyone is saying we are getting the true down on his luck Parker, I can‚Äôt say it really feels like Peter with him being a 17 year old GED student with no family, no MJ, no Flash, no Betty Brant, no Ned, no Harry, and none of his major recurring villains (Goblin/Dr Ock).",ri7eum

IMO many people have overlooked just how strong SM is physically. He EASILY threw Winter Soldiers metal arm to the side in Civil War, and WS is every bit as strong as Cap. And in Infinity War SM was dealing more damage (going off how much Thanos got knocked around) than Iron Man was doing.",ri7eum

hox77sl,"Andrew conveyed the emotions so well when his Spiderman saved MJ.

Also I don't know if it was done intentionally, but when Andrew saves MJ, he first catches her and then uses the web to slow down both of them, unlike in TASM2 where he directly uses the web to catch Gwen which proved fatal. I think it was a nice touch.",ri7eum
hox7pe1,"Honestly, I wonder if Peter can ever have friends or a gf *in the context of these movies*.

Of course, in the comics, he has relationships and gets married. 

But I interpreted certain aspects of this movie in a darker way.

During the rooftop reconciliation scene, all the Peters bond over their loss of a loved one. It seems to be their 'fate'. 

So then, what of that loved one? They only exist to die and propel Peter's maturation forward? Don't they have interior lives & hopes and dreams of their own?

And since they all died, how can Peter reliably stop other people close to him from dying *without* cutting them out of his life for their own safety?

I'm reminded of the ending scene from Amazing Spiderman 1. Gwen's dad asks Peter to stay away - because he's going to wind up endangering her. Well, by the end of the film and after Capt. Stacy *dies*, Peter disregards his advice and dates Gwen officially.

And then she dies in the 2nd movie (like she always dies in the comics). 

So at the end of *No Way Home*, shouldn't Peter cut MJ and Ned out of his life?

He has these 2 other Spidermen to learn from - so wouldn't that be the biggest lesson in light of Aunt May's death?

I hope that he does this and it becomes the central tragedy of the new trilogy - letting go of his past life.

Moving forward, he will be alone *at first*. How will Peter learn from everything that happened in this trilogy?

That's what's most exciting to me.",ri7eum

In all seriousness, I wonder what the next step for Holland's Parker is. A clean slate is easy enough but he somehow has to develope emotional stakes for the next movie to matter. We know Harry Osbourne is not in this universe, so who will he meet? 

I also wonder who the next villain would be, we have pretty much gone through all the major ones I think, although I would personally love to see Kraven the Hunter.

I would also love to see a Black Cat introduction in the next movie. 

Given the currently announced Marvel Studios release schedule, it looks like we won't be seeing Spiderman for another 2 plus years. I hope Tom Holland will be back for a team up movie. Maybe Secret Wars? (Which would be pretty convenient given it was the first appearance of the black suit Spiderman in the comics).",ri7eum

There's depth to those characters which I don't think the MCU has, as of now, achieved. The developments at the end of the movie - resetting MCU Peter to a more traditional setting (anonymous, poor, shouldering a heavy burden) will do a lot to fix that.

I will say that Marvel has done a good job of setting up Strange and Spider-Man to anchor the next wave of films. They're never going to capture the RDJ magic again but Cumberbatch and Holland are great faces for the franchise.",ri7eum

hoxrinq,"Great fan service film and lots of very enjoyable moments. The plot felt extremely forced and characters were making stupid and imo out of character decisions in order for the plot to progress to where they clearly wanted it.

In one scene he breaks our heart and in another gives the creepiest vibes. The first fight scene with Tom Holland where he was taking his punches, his facial expression went from pain to maniac. This is great acting to say the least. And his line deliveries were just marvelous. I really hope there is a strong push from Disney for a supporting actor nomination for the upcoming Oscars.",ri7eum

All the callbacks to his previous films, comics, games - made me feel overjoyed and as if I was transported back to 2002, my younger days. It felt great being able to relive his amazing adventures. Together with Spiderverse, it is my favorite Spiderman movie. 10/10. It will always have a place in my heart. Seeing Alfred Molina and other rouges brought a huge smile to my face.",ri7eum

- Murdock's cameo felt like the most comic book moment ever- where random characters show up for a single panel and disappear. Love that they did it, as they clearly could have cut him out

- Confirmed that MJ is MJ Watson- hopefully everyone who wants the ""real"" mary jane to show up can calm down. 

- Glad this wasnt Dr Strange Jr, which i was afraid it would be. Strange is in it just enough, and i cant wait for Multiverse of Madness

- Green Goblin is great, and its exactly what happens when you go to Willem Dafoe and say ""go off""

- Electros line about how he thought Garfield's Spidey would be black was amazing lol",ri7eum
hoyhzwg,"I really enjoyed it, had way less annoying Joss Whedon quips and way more emotion than I expected. Plus Tobey just still has it after all these years. Though watching this made me remember how much I fucking hate movie theaters since the dude sitting next to me that reeked of weed when he wasn't shoveling buckets of popcorn into his mouth felt the need to repeat the line that any character on screen just said. I don't think I've had an enjoyable theater experience since the first Avengers movie because for some reason since that film so many audience members think it's totally fine to just not shut the fuck up and scream.

I also had 0 interest in this new Holland trilogy they announced but after the end of this film I'm down. They have Spider-Man actually feeling like Spider-Man again living in a dumpy apartment, no one to rely on but himself, no more Stark Tech but instead sews his own suit like Tobey and Garfield did, the movie really feels like the writers taking responsibility for all the criticisms people had over the years.",ri7eum

- Tom got to act his ass off. Great to see him coming into his own traditional Spider-Man by the end of the film

As soon as it started I was like, ""oohh here we go!"" It went pretty much as I expected too, Strange was practically toying with Spider-Man at first until eventually they went into the mirror-dimension which was absolutely mind blowing. The audio during that scene was done so spectacularly that the entire IMAX theater sounded like it was inside the mirror dimension as well.

My only gripe was I felt like goblin and tobeys spiderman should of had a scene together.

Dafoe absolutely stole the show for me though.

I do wish we had more moments with peter and aunt may. Her dying for me had zero impact, because unlike the previous spider-man movies, we never got any really good scenes with aunt may and peter. So her dying was sad but it had no impact on me. 

The 2 other spider-man were great. The comedic timing was was better than most MCU movies. Nothing felt forced. 

I kind of wished, andrews spider-man had moments with the foes from tobeys spider-man, would have been fun to see.

Wishing one day we get TASM 3 and spider-man 4. I'm sure sony is considering it, since they love money.",ri7eum

I'm sad about the ending because there's very little I despise more than the ""memory wipe"" narrative trope. I don't even nitpick stuff usually, but that technique always destroys my suspension of disbelief, just couldn't care for it.

Luckily the full trailer of MoM got my spirits up again, very hyped for that!",ri7eum

Pretty cool how Tobey is maybe the oldest iteration of Spiderman in the films we've seen, although I think it shows how you can't do the role for too long. He worked as support and he had some amazing stunts but any given actor can't play Spidey too long. I'm glad Holland is breaking the 'three film curse' (two for Garfield), I hope for the same for the Spiderverse films (if they can make it engaging).",ri7eum

Tobey:

Since Goblin was cured, does this mean things in his universe change? Harry's whole motivation was that Spider-Man killed Norman. But since Norman was cured, he shouldn't have died and things should be different. 

Same for Doc Ock. Shouldn't he be in jail now and not dead? Or do they still go back and die? 

I would love a Post-Credits scene with Tobey and Dunst and it's like: ""Hey, Harry wanted to see you."" ""What?"" And you see how things have changed. But we didn't get that. Missed Opportunity.

&#x200B;

Garfield:

Why couldn't we see him meet MJ? Or Gwen be alive? Again things should have changed. But... missed opportunity.

hozmrsr,"I liked the stuff with the 3 spider-men (though it took too long to get there imo) and I enjoyed the villains for the most part too. But the emotional beats didn't work for me. 

You can't spend film after film treating Aunt May like nothing but a punchline and then expect us to care when she dies, even if you shoehorn in a 'great responsibility' speech 20 seconds before she's gone. Also this is just a nit-pick but how did she survive so long after being clobbered by the glider and blown up?

Also whilst I've enjoyed MJ and Ned (particularly the latter) in these films I've never been too invested in their relationships with Peter, they've mostly felt like side characters. Iron Man seemed to be the main emotional driver for Peter in Homecoming and imo his ghost took that role in FFH. Maybe I'm in the minority but the scene where Peter gets dusted in Iron Man's arms hit me way harder than him saying goodbye and later choosing to stay distant to MJ and Ned. I feel like something's gone wrong if I'm more emotionally invested in Peter saying goodbye to Tony Stark than MJ.

Other than that I thought there were some pacing issues and in typical MCU fashion the ratio of funny quips to quips that make you cringe and/or kill the moment wasn't great. But in spite of these criticisms I still enjoyed it overall and would recommend it to any Spider-Man or MCU fans.",ri7eum
hozn7g2,"Loved it so damn much.  I took my 3yo, since he just started appreciating super heroes, with Spider-Man being his current favorite.  He was a blast to sit with.  He cheered when others cheered, and sat through the whole thing.  

I had to watch my childhood spidermen and watch a brand new Spider-Man with my boy, who‚Äôs just entering the new wave of superheroes.

At the very end, as we waited for the post credit scene, he said he wanted to be the next Spider-Man.",ri7eum

They felt more like MCU stories feat. Spider-Man. Thor's movies felt Thor movies, Guardians movies felt like Guardians and so on and so forth while Spidey's didn't feel like they belong to him but finally. 

This truly felt like a Spider-Man movie. This was Tom's movie. Seeing Tobey and Andrew was wonderful. Tobey telling Andrew he is amazing was heartwarming. The ending was beautiful, full of hope and man i wish we could've seen more of that suit because gawd it looked gorgeous. 

I now understand this trilogy of Tom's Spider-Man was his origin story. I just couldn't see it until now and now I want to see more of Tom's Spider-Man.

The Avengers would surely still count him as one of their own, albeit with a secret identity as opposed to them knowing he's Peter?

hp09y7r,"Two things I keep seeing people question are how the spell works at the end and why no one with the ability to prove he was innocent stepped in.

To the latter, I tell you to look at real life. People actively choose to believe or disbelieve in science, fact, and truth for various reasons. If Pepper, Sam, or even Thor said he was innocent people would just call it a cover up or conspiracy. The Earth is flat, we never went to the moon, and Mysterio was right!

On the spell, just because people don‚Äôt remember Peter doesn‚Äôt mean he can‚Äôt exist. Just like you don‚Äôt remember every kid from your grade school days, he could still be present in events in his life but not a focal point. So while Spider-Man could have still been recruited by Stark and the Avengers, he may never had taken off the mask. Remember his first adventure with the FF after the reset in the comics? They knew Spidey, they remembered past adventures, but Peter was a blur, a forgotten memory to distant to recall. So Peter can still exist in the world, but as a nobody who the world forgot or in this case never knew.",ri7eum

* Why did Toby‚Äôs spider sense not go off that he was about to get stabbed?
* With their memories wiped, how would MJ and Ned rationalize they‚Äôre on the island?
* With Strange‚Äôs memory of Spidey wiped, how would he rationalize the reason why he tampered with reality and multiple dimensions? Peter was the reason.
* how did Electro not know who Peter was if the premise of why he was there was knowing who Spider Man is?
* how are they going to make more Spider Man movies if they basically just used all of Spider Man‚Äôs A list villains in one movie so if MCU sees an Osbon or Octavius, he‚Äôll surely be sketched out?
* it seems the premise of the spell changed at beginning of movie vs. after? At beginning, it was that everyone would forget that he was Spider Man and MJ and Ned would only forget him if his relationship depended on him being Spider Man. At the end of the movie, everyone just forgot who he was entirely. Did that inconsistency seem weird to anyone or was it explained?
* It's weird that Harry wasn't in the movie since he knew Spider-Man's identity, right? (But I get why because of Franco's issues)",ri7eum

hp3bkox,not only did Tom‚Äôs spider-man mature at the end I think we have seen Jon Watts mature as a director as well. hope he directs the next trilogy,ri7eum
hp3brg9,"when u think about it, every multiversal character in the movie came from a different universe since the villains from the sequel movies know that the older villains died and the Peters themselves are pretty far in their timelines after their last movies ended and that should mean their villains should already be dead except may be sandman. So in a way, they are all just as much as strangers to their respective peters as they are to mcu Peter.


Also crazy nitpicking, but the movie doesn't show how Peter or his friends manages to break the villains out of their magic prisons after strange gets locked out in the mirror dimension. I don't think the movie shows a ""release everyone"" button in the dungeon and they couldn't possibly use magic themselves to get them out.


Also I have a crazy fan theory or more like a speculation, that doctor strange might actually be planning something evil. He doesn't show up in Wandavision even though he knows about Westview based on post credit scene/teaser. Technically he is the one who fks up the spell in this movie(and even mj points it out) even though it could be totally avoided by planning it before. It is kind of played as a joke but he says he is afraid of wong knowing his messing up of the spell. Wanda is now kind of a ""oh, yikes"" for rest of the characters even though strange could have prevented it and Peter is even worse being completely erased from memories. So may be he has some ulterior motives behind these actions or at least I thought like that until they showed the darker strange who I guess, can fulfill that evil Dr strange role but it would be still cool to pull some twist like that.",ri7eum
hp3bwpa,"Just saw the movie again, absolutely slaps on repeat viewings. I‚Äôm now thinking that we see Ned and Peter in MoM, and they may reverse the memory thing to kick off Tom Holland in a new trilogy.

hp3fp57,I thought we were going to see the OG landlord and his daughter at the end,ri7eum
hp3i3ah,"Loved it for the following reasons:

\-they finally grew Tom Holland's Peter Parker up and placed him in a ""true"" Spider-man setting: broke, cheap apartment, struggling to make rent and superhero-ing in his own homemade costume with no luxurious Avengers back-up. Friendly Neighborhood Spider-man indeed.

&#x200B;

\-gave us closure to Tobey and Andrew's Spider-men and let us know they were both going to be okay. Both of their takes on the character just kind of ""ended"", so it was nice to hear Tobey's Peter had made it work with Mary-Jane and Andrew's Peter getting the boost he needed to keep on fighting the good fight after Gwen's death. Great stuff for both of those more than deserving actors.

&#x200B;

\-finally bringing some gravitas to this era's Peter with stakes that felt real and hard lessons for Peter to learn (ties into point one, but wanted to give a special shout out to Marisa Tomei's excellent work in her final scene).

&#x200B;

\-yes, the nostalgia of getting to play in the spider-box with all our favorite villains. Great to see Molina continue to bring pathos to Doc Ock and Dafoe unleashed as the Goblin was a comic book dream come true.

&#x200B;

\-Zendaya remains MVP of any project she's in. MJ's final scenes with Peter were appropriately heart-wrenching and leaves you rooting for these two kids to find their way back to each other. Zendaya did a lot of the heavy lifting there and I'm hoping they find a way to incorporate her into the next Tom Holland iteration.

&#x200B;

Yes, it was convoluted and typical MCU-messy but the fun and good outweighs the bad and confusing here by far. I'm excited to see where they take Spidey. Would love to see him grab an internship at the Bugle and spar with JJJ; maybe meet Felicia Hardy and his own Eddie Brock at NYU? Become friends with Miles Morales?

The discussion about natural webbing. The banter between Spideys. And ""I'm something of a scientist myself."" Hannibal Buress ripping into him while JB Smoove complimented him had me rolling.

I know Aunt May died, but if she had lived, would there still be a room in her house that belongs to Peter Parker with his name probably on homework and random stuff that she could see? Does that news footage released by the bugle revealing Spider-Man‚Äôs identity still exist? Does Peter still even have a social security number attached to him? It would be different if they just forgot he was Spider-Man, but they seemed to forget him entirely, like Peter Parker is not a person anyone knows anymore, but his stuff still exists?

I also found it weird that Topher's Venom wasn't in this since he was also killed by Spider-Man.

hp4d2ke,"Can someone help me understand some parts I didn‚Äôt understand?

So the characters are pulled into the MCU universe from their own universes because they know ‚ÄúPeter Parker is Spider-Man.‚Äù And in the dialogue it makes it sound like the villains are pulled right before they die. But these felons died at different points among their timelines, so how are they pulled in to one simultaneous moment? I don‚Äôt know if that makes sense. Like, how does Norman know that his son died? 

What exactly are the parameters of the spell at the end of the movie? Does Spiderman just not exist at all in the MCU past events? Or do people accept that he was there, but have no idea of his memory (including the Avengers/his friends?) in the end shot it looks like he was studying from a GED manual. Does that mean that ‚ÄúPeter Parker‚Äù no longer exists? He‚Äôd still graduate from high school right? And wouldn‚Äôt his friends still know him as Peter Parker?

Do we know the limits of Strange‚Äôs spellcasting abilities? Like, would Thor or the guardians of the galaxy or Captain Marvel be able to remember him as they weren‚Äôt on earth when the spell was cast?",ri7eum
hp4gs50,"I've been seeing so much discussion/videos on the internet why Tom Holland's version of Spider-Man is truly not Spider-man (due to him being connected to Stark Industries and no Uncle Ben death shown, aside from a 2-second segment of him loading up his clothes in a ""UB"" bag), but this movie definitely redeemed it for me. When Aunt May died, he started to be different, he wasn't that happy spoiled teenager but actually spiderman. It was chilling to see him change and now living in a cheap damp New York apartment with a spider suit that HE created.

3.) I like the fact that all the villains are villain bec. of psychological side effect of what happened to them. So it makes sense that they can be cured.

hp9cndh,"*Because Sony has the rights to Spider-Man, Disney and Sony had originally reached a deal for Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019), whereby Marvel produced these movies for Sony under the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) banner. Sony kept full financial, distributive and creative control, while Disney received merchandising rights and a small percentage of the gross box office. However, in August 2019, Sony wanted to expand the deal with Disney under the original terms, which led to Disney exerting its right to back out of the next Spider-Man film. Sony, which had done well with Venom (2018) and especially Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), then announced that they would continue making the film within their own cinematic universe, outside of the MCU. However, due to negative fan reaction and after intervention of star Tom Holland, a new deal was eventually reached, with Disney investing into the film‚Äôs budget in exchange for a higher box office percentage, and the movie remaining in the MCU.

First of all, I loved the movie but the ending has me worried.
I‚Äôm worried that was a very strategic retcon of Tom‚Äôs story. They took away his Stark tech and his contribution in the Infinity War arc by erasing him from memory. Now Sony doesn‚Äôt need Disney and can do Spiderman outside of the MCU with no problems. I don‚Äôt want to see that. This Spiderman is solidly in the MCU and needs to stay there.",ri7eum

hpaen85,"OK, just a thought I had immediatly after the credits rolled:  
The spell brought back the ""people who know P.P. is Spiderman"", and apparently it did so at an earlier time (before Electro / Goblin ... died), doesn't that mean, Gwen Stacy could have been brought back?  
\-> She knew that Garfield-P.P. was Spiderman  
\-> She died after Electro, so the spell hit their universe before her death  


I am so mad at Marvel! My tortured soul could have really done with a true proper happy send-off to the TASM-characters. You had the power to make things good and you chose not to!

If the spell was for everyone to forget Peter Parker, and it was to stop people form all multiverses who knew Peter parker's identity.

I do wonder what they'll do for Spider-Man now though. We got Daredevil again, so there's no reason why the next trilogy wouldn't give us a more grounded Spidey. It's actually a neat idea.

‚ÄúSuper weird, I was at the Statue of Liberty, helping Spider-Man, cause he‚Äôs like my best friend, but then he took off his mask, and I blacked out for a few seconds. Actually, come to think of it, I don‚Äôt actually know who he is.‚Äù

Also, there has to be a physical effect of his existence right? Like things Stark mailed to him, that didn‚Äôt actually contain any identifying info. It‚Äôs not like the spell changed time, so if someone left something at Peter‚Äôs house, for example, they may not remember why, but they would remember doing it, right?

For that matter, people can remember Spider-Man, but not Peter Parker, so where is the overlap? Like if someone was on the phone with Peter, and he told them he was Spider-Man, they would remember the part relating to him being Spider-Man, right?

hrnlc6g,"Went to this in 3D yesterday.  Considering how formulaic the MCU movies have become, I'm honestly not sure how to say whether something is ""better"" or ""worse"" than another MCU movie or compared to past iterations.  I'd say perhaps that in terms of the MCU Spidey, this one perhaps had a bit more heart than just humor which the others went for.  Since we didn't witness Peter's origin with Ben and all that, that aspect of emotion felt missing from the previous two movies.  As ham-handed as a lot of it was, including May's death, this sort of served as an ""origin"" to get Peter out of being a puppet and into his own thing as a lone wolf superhero who has grown up.  So even though it was poorly paced, had some questionable scenes and motivations and cringe-inducing moments, it sort of stuck the landing.  

As far as the returning characters, this kind of fucks up any plans to include these characters as villains in new Spidey flicks, doesn't it?  I'm surprised that they did SO much referencing of the previous movies given the internal studio issues with how both of them ended up and the purpose of the MCU Spidey being to ignore them.  I wasn't expecting the returned iterations to be so extended and important; I thought that the Spideys would appear for maybe one scene or something.  However, all this multiverse stuff was already done in the *Spider-Verse* flick and will be repeated in *Flash*.  Dafoe did okay, but I'm not that big on the others' involvement.  A little Foxx goes a long way, and he could have been canned.  I knew that Maguire was in this due to an accidental look at a cast list, but didn't know for sure about Garfield.  Viewing Garfield again emphasized that he deserved better in his movies.  They're not bad movies, but he was a better Spidey than the material.  Maguire was my Spidey on film, and it was cool to have him back despite him looking a bit tentative.  Some of the dialogue between them all was awkward (""You're amazing!"").  Maguire being stabbed and then shrugging it off was pretty lame manipulation.  

Also cringe-inducing was the idea to ""cure"" the villains because they'll be killed if sent back.  Well, duh, they're bad people and have already been killed, although I don't think Sandman was.  Restoring them would fuck up the time continuum in their dimensions.  Then the ""I need the cure"" stuff was also pretty lame.",ri7eum

Strange plans on casting a world altering spell that will affect the minds of every person on the planet, including his own, and doesn't take 5 minutes to hash out the details with Parker before just going on with it and then blames Pete for it? Like wouldn't he want to include himself in the exception list of whose memories to delete anyway?

Asides from that though, I absolutely loved it. Seeing the 3 Spider Men play off each other was the highlight. Andrew's saving MJ and being happy he got to spare Holland that pain, Tobey stopping his attack and just looking at him with understanding.

hqmp1bz,"I‚Äôm getting more pissed at this film the more I think about it. I saw it early today. 

This films just throws away the lineage Tony Stark has towards Tom Hollands Peter and the set up in both Homecoming and Far From Home of Peter taking over. Idk if they did it for Ironheart which I‚Äôll be frank I‚Äôll be pissed if they did it for that. Watching Peter get his spider tech suit to getting the Stark builder box and making his new suit was freaking cool, solidifying Peters ascend into being the person to take Tony‚Äôs mantle. But nope! They strip everything away in the third film carelessly that was built upon in the first two. 

Magic Ned is a bummer because there was no set up in previous films and they make it clear in Strange‚Äôs movie that learning magic ain‚Äôt for everyone and a steep curve and certain people can do it. 

I was hoping we would have seen the meme of the three Spider-Man pointing to each other on the big screen but that was a missed opportunity. I‚Äôm just bummed. I hope the 4th film retcon this film. We don‚Äôt need to see another Spider-Man in the shitty solo apt. struggling.

how4u2y,"Am I the only one who feels the ending made the entire movie basically meaningless? The issue Strange had with casting the spell originally is that everyone would forget Peter Parker is Spider-Man. He goes through this entire event, and then an even worse outcome; everyone forgets Peter Parker is Spider-Man and also his life as Peter Parker has essentially disappeared? Having to take the GED exam implies that he never finished high school , or at least there was no record of it. Seems incredibly lackluster. Unless I‚Äôm missing something",ri7eum
howf901,"My only gripe with the film, besides typical immature, bratty, and spoiled MCU Spider-Man getting people killed and ruining timelines, is that the actors for Sandman and Lizard weren‚Äôt even fucking present? Sandman was awkwardly in perpetual sand mode and Lizard was always in some dark corner with his eyes visible. They literally reused clips from their old movies, it was so painfully obvious, and there was no wholesome moment with Tobey and Flint. They got the other actors back, wtf happened?",ri7eum
howmz8c,"I thought the first act was the best. All the chaos and Peter trying to manage the situation felt real and consequential. Everything after that just felt scattershot and I could never get on board with the plot or Peter's decisions. He really annoyed me in this film, his thinking was awful. Just send them back to their own worlds ffs. Dr Strange had more patience than I could ever have with Peter.

I didn't really feel any of the emotional impact. Aunt May's death did nothing for me- she was a background character for this trilogy; she served little purpose. The only bit that got me was Andrew's Spidey saving MJ and his reaction. That was raw.

I also think they squandered the potential of the three spidey's coming together. Tobey looked half-asleep and didn't want to be there. Andrew was far more energetic and put more effort into his role. Their first encounter together felt like such a downer and their banter just wasn't at the level I wanted it to be. Bonding over Uncle Ben stuff was expected but I wish their first meeting was more comical. The shot of them all swinging around was cool though.

The villains were a mixed bag. Doc Ock was obviously great and crazy Green Goblin is fun. Electro was not good, I'm sorry but Jamie Foxx never suited that role. Lizard was just there looking like a CGI mess still. Sandman was a weird one though. Wouldn't he want to go back to his original world? He doesn't exist in the MCUverse so neither does his daughter so why would he want to stick around here. His motivation was always his daughter so I don't know why he randomly turned bad along with all the other villains at the midpoint.

And the cure didn't really make sense. It completely stripped Lizard and Sandman of their powers but Doc Ock still has his robo arms and Electro still has his electro-powers?

I do kind of worry that people are so distracted by the nostalgia and the call-backs that they aren't properly judging this film. Like yeah it's fun to hear Norman say his famous line and to see Tobey talk about his back but if that's the main thing people are taking from this film then what's the point. Studios are really weaponising nostalgia and I see no end to it now.

Finally, the plot did remind me a little of X-Men 3 with the McGuffin being a cure and the villains trying to destroy it.

Also, the sequence with Dr Strange trying to get the box back from Spidey made him look real pathetic. Like come on Strange, jesus.",ri7eum

Peter didn't have to release all of the villains to help them; instead, he could have kept them in their containment cells and treated them one at a time. Putting complete trust that supervillains will just sit and wait for you to cure them is a really stupid character choice and a writing contrivance.

Too much destruction and people lives ruined for the pay off in this one.

Second the movie ended two minutes too late. All you had to was see him walk into the dounut shop, smile, and say ""i'm peter parker"". Hard cut like edge of tomorrow. Him doing scanner stuff and small crime felt like a rehash. Nothing learned nothing gained. Only sadness for last 20minutes of the movie with no payoff.

&#x200B;

He made a deal with his friends to tell them the truth. They know the consequences, its selfish to keep them out the loop for their own good. Plus by this movie they have earned their place in the world and they were just become interesting to the movie.

Hard reset didn't feel earned and didn't make much sense with the last 1 minute of the movie. That was a depressing ending.

hq2988k,"Marvel movies frustrate me by hamstringing any and all of their interesting set-ups. No Way Home reminds me of Endgame in the way it squanders its strong premise for a bland, saccharine, and even cynical interdimensional love-in. Where it has a cohesive beginning and end, this movie's middle forms a bulky coulda/woulda body that might have been formidable if it weren't so unapologetically stupid.

Yes, curing warped-in villains of their sin by stabbing them with anti-psychotics sounds incorrigible, but it might have worked if there was connective tissue to Spider-Man's identity dilemma. But that relevance never materializes, just more Spider-Men. Most of the movie after that point is perfunctory Marvel quips, gags, and touching moments - until the end, which loops back to the strong beginning. How this was botched after Spiderverse wrote the perfect cheat-sheet a couple of years earlier is confusing. 

Marvel would be wise to remember the reason audiences even cared about the cameo-ing Macguire and Garfield: they loved their movies as movies (well, at least Garfield was great in TAS). If the narrative hook to your films is pushed to the side, an after-thought that gives way to franchise building and crowd pleasers, once you run out of steam, you'll step into a cold zeitgeist that has no lasting attachment or good-will to spare.

Not to get confused, I adored the movie. Really, I enjoyed more or less every moment of it. The whole multiverse thing and the appearances of characters from the previous two reboots were absolutely lit. Even I got goosebumps when Andrew and Tobey showed up.

But someone has to say it. It's crystal clear that the only reason the studio decided to put the multiverse thing to action was because they thought they couldn't find someone else to play Doc Oc in MCU other than Molina. (And there are plenty of them who could play him.)

And I don't know what's sadder; that very fact, or the fact that a 70-year-old Alfred Molina (as well as a 66-year-old Willem Dafoe, etc.) actually agreed to reprise his role.

Don't get me wrong, the movie was still awesome, and all the performances were fucking top-notch - but the fact that this movie was good is actually a bad thing.

hpm639i,"This truly shows why the MCU is such a killer idea and a pop cultural phenomenon. This movie is beyond fantastic and it perfectly wraps up the loose ends left by previous films and executive meddling.

The original Spider-Man films with Tobey were great for the time and Andrew Garfield added a new vibe to the character. Then comes Tom Holland whose Spider-Man is more modern, is an Avenger, is Tony Stark's apprentice and uses his technology and doesn't have an Uncle Ben or Gwen Stacy. He gets an entirely new Spider-Man story.

Then this movie comes in just in time when the MCU has proven to be unstoppable and Sony realized that only Marvel can do their own character's films right.

The movie allowed the villains some redemption as Otto really wasn't evil and he got a second chance by helping the Spider-Men in their mission. Sandman's story was always sad to me because I felt that after Spider-Man 3 he would never get what he wanted and was cursed to stay a freak forever.

Electro had an interesting edge to him and the Lizard was a bit less prominent as a character. But the Green Goblin finally proved why he is Spider-Man's biggest enemy - he did the unspeakable and killed MCU's aunt May! (I never saw that coming)

The performances by everyone were excellent and the emotional moments were so heavy and well-done. Andrew felt reinvigorated, Tobey was wise and sage-like and Tom finally got a fresh start as THE Spider-Man we know from the comics.

Seeing Doctor Strange in this movie was also fantastic as it set the stage for his film and others to come. It takes me back to reading The Amazing Spider-Man (the original 1960s comic) and its first annual issue seeing Doctor Strange's astral form in the middle of a Spider-Man story.

This is why the MCU is an excellent idea - so many storytelling possibilities in a shared universe and we finally get a Spider-Man starting all over. It's Marvel fixing all the problems that came out of their having to sell Spider-Man to Sony in the 1990s and setting up Tom Holland as the current and only Spider-Man.

He lost his aunt, heard the great responsibility speech from her, fought the incomplete Sinister Six, met multiverse versions of himself, lost his love and best friend, has to start from scratch by sewing his own suit, will come across a symbiote one way or another, now lives broke and alone in a shitty apartment and saves the neighborhood with his brains, heart, wit and willpower.

All of this because a comic writer in the 60s was fighting to have an idea about a teenage superhero with real-life problems made into an actual comic. An initially rejected idea that would grow to become one of the most complex and interesting characters in global pop culture.

When the 2nd trailer was released and we saw MJ falling, I just imagined how cool it would be seeing Andrew flying in out of nowhere and catching her and that being his first involvement in the movie.

Same with Tobey, I imagined Tom being put in a really dangerous situation by one of the villains then out of frame a Web shoots in and its Tobey's Spider-Man saving Tom's Spider-Man, or something similar to that.

But on the other hand I can see why they came in as early as they did because it gave them a lot of screen time whereas in my scenario they would have had about half the screen time.

But as the film goes you kinda lose that sense of threat. Stuff like making fun of doc ocks name, Dafoe doing the meme lines etc. I dunno, the meta jokes break the immersion you have with the film and reminds you that it's a movie. 

That hit the peak when the other 2 showed up. They have all their jokes about each other and kinda poking fun of their movies and it doesn't fit the tone at all. It's like something out of a YouTube skit. I dunno, it just took all the tension/stakes out of the movie for me. 

But regardless I still loved a lot. The entire first act was pretty flawless (even if you could tell scenes were cut to make it move quickly). The ending was fantastic. You could tell there was a conscious effort to make Holland's Spidey more like the iconic version of Spider man people know. This was there right from the start of the film but obviously at its most in the end. It left me excited to see where theyll take the character. 

I'm being critical because that's what sticks out, but I did enjoy a lot. Everything up to all the villains being put in Syrange's prison and the multiverse fight was straight up some of my favourite stuff in the MCU in a while. Itsjust once they brought the other spideys in that it lost me a bit. And some of it was too repetitive of Spider Verse. Ending was tragic and fantastic tho 

I'm repeating myself a lot. Whatever. I think parts of the movie were better than Homecoming, butit didn't keep the immersion throughout sadly. Still enjoyed it a great deal.",ri7eum
hpb2yt8,"Really didn't care for it. I checked out after Endgame and I think I probably should've just stayed checked out, it was nice seeing Tobey and Andrew as I'm sure most people can agree, but I think people's opinions will start to shift as the initial insane hype dies down. 

Also, I might be being lame, but I absolutely hated the end of Daredevil's introduction and reaffirmed my fears that I'm probably not going to care for how Marvel treats the characters from the Netflix shows, tonally at least.

hp6yfab,"I only have three critiques for the movie:

1) That they only used spider-men & villains from previous, non-MCU movies and didn't throw in any wild cards like other actors as Peter Parkers or villains we have never seen on screen before.  In the end, feels a little lazy in retrospect. 

2) I feel like they spent the first two films building up Flash Thompson as someone who would absolutely resent the fact that Peter Parker, a person he believes he is better than in every respect gets to be Spider-man (and an Avenger).  I liked the idea of us letting them slowly build up this character from classmate & bully to full-fledged villain (after all, he does become a version of Venom in the comics).

3) And speaking of Venom, why was the current Sony version of Venom/Eddie Brock pulled through into the MCU?  These two have NEVER met or even heard of a Spider-Man or Peter Parker in their two movies.  Why would the spell affect them?

Other than that, it was an excellent movie that I will watch again.  The crowd in my theater cheered when the other Spider-men showed up.  Willem Dafoe bringing that ""Lighthouse"" crazy energy.",ri7eum

hp2dczz,"I just came back from the cinema. Overall it's entertaining, but Idk if I missed some parts or it never mentioned. It was too quick for Andrew to understand that MJ is equivalent to his Grwen and too quick for him to realize and accept he was in another universe. Even if he is smart, the thought process is too quick in the span of not even a day. Same for Tobey. So many things felt rushed yet the scene where they confronted and talked to each other about Ben and Gwen felt too... dragging. 

May died too early on, and the thing she taught Tom about helping these vilians was kinda... stupid, in a way. They could've come up with different approach rather than pin it on life-lession and on May like that. The fighting in the first act was great but all the vilians disappeared in the second act, only to came back and magically knew the location of all  three Spider-Men. Green Goblin built up beautifully and bam, beating up to death easily. I was hoping for some kind of explosion or deception from him. Nonetheless, Willem did a fantastic job. 

There is something missing but I can't quite put it into perspective. The only thing I appreciated is the feature of 3 Spider-Men together. And the other 3 vilians. I came to realize how good of a vilian Thanos was, best development and writing ever.

Never have I seen them explore a character on such a level. This was a true Peter Parker story. When I came out I felt like I had watched a really good movie with an amazing ending. Peter Parker without stark tech, money, help from avengers, this is who he is supposed to be. We will be witnessing the true friendly neighborhood spiderman.

hpjo588,"I really enjoyed the movie but like Civil War, it has a ton of ramifications that if not followed through in future films, it becomes super annoying and pretty much a moot point. I mean, does the Sokovia Accords even mean anything anymore? Is anyone even enforcing it?

Some thoughts:

\-Considering all that has happened, I'm surprised at the negative public opinion of Peter being outed as Spider-Man. Sure, you'll get a few assholes here and there but overall, you'd think people would actually hero worship him.

\-I know Gwyneth Paltrow is likely no longer making any more MCU films but there's no way in-universe Pepper wouldn't step in to defend Peter. And we're expected to believe that with control of EDITH back in Peter's hands, he couldn't produce proper proof of the fight with Mysterio?

\-So we really expect to believe Talos dragged Spider-Man into the mess with Mysterio but just upped and left him to deal with the fallout?

\-Unless they use a different continuity than the Netflix series/comics, Matt Murdoch doesn't have super strength or invulnerability. That catch of the brick through the window should've wrecked his hand.

\-Storytelling wise, I wished it was Amazing Goblin instead of Electro as he actually knew Andrew's identity as Spider-Man while Electro didn't. I get them not wanting two goblins but curing Amazing Goblin would also prevent Gwen Stacey's death, undoing the tragedy that shaped Andrew's path, giving him true redemption. But as a viewer, I much prefer to watch Jamie Foxx over Dane DeHaan.

\-As Sorcerer Supreme, you'd think one of your own guys messing up a spell leading to a break in the multiuniversal reality would take priority over whatever Wong was doing. 

\-It looks like Sandman comes from a future way beyond Spider-Man 3 as he asks Tom if he remembers him. He's still a piece of shit though, resorting to violence for no reason as if he hasn't learned his lesson from everything that happened in SM3. 

\-Willem Dafoe is still amazing as always.

\-So Tobey has been watching Tom, presumably by following him around but didn't step in when Goblin was wrecking the condo?

\-So a high school lab has everything you need to undo lizard mutations and military grade goblin sterioids, huh?

\-""He died in my arms, after he tried to kill me."" Dude, he died in your arms after saving your ass from Topher Venom. Lead with that! Or at least explain the goblin serum messing him up which is why you want to develop a cure.

\-Ned promising not to become a super villain is cute and hopefully not an omen.

\-It's unfortunate curing Otto and Electro would do nothing to prevent their fates. The moment Otto arrives to the MCU, the fusion experiment already became self-sustaining. He would still have to drown the thing, which is what killed him. And Max would return to the point where he gets fried. 

\-The other Spider-Men not knowing what the Avengers are is hilarious.

\-I liked how Tobey's theme and Andrew Garfield's theme from their respective films is incorporated into the soundtrack.

\-Tobey getting stabbed was one hell of an emotional rollercoaster.

\-I don't know how I feel about hijacking Tom Hardy just to introduce the symbiote into the MCU.",ri7eum
hpmmyb6,"I'd venture to suggest this movie was, at list in part inspired by the Spider-verse movie.  Given that movie's commercial success must have, at least in part, been part of the Disney/Marvel/Sony/Pascal decision process.

That being said, I totally loved this movie.  I was a big fan of the Raimi trilogy (and Venom, though we only caught a glimpse of that), and not so keen on Garfield's 2nd one... 

An amazing movie, bringing closure to 7 different movies and 3 Peter Parker iterations.  It felt like Endgame for Spiderman.  

So meta, so heroic, yet so... human.  Leaving MJ to her own devices in that coffee shop, that was a nice touch too.

It also showcases the amazing acting skills of Marisa Tomei.  Let's face it, she previously didn't have a lot of Aunt May material to work with, but her star went nova in this movie.

hq3nsem,"Unpopular Opinion!

I really didn't like this movie and I would be happy if someone could turn my opinion around. Everywhere just shows praise for it and I don't get it. I really don't see it. There were some really fun moments but I didn't enjoy the means that were used to get to the end. For reference, I am a big MCU and Spiderman fan. I think Tom Holland does a great job and Homecoming is actually one of my favorite MCU movies.

&#x200B;

What I actually liked about it: 

Performances. I thought that there were a number of good performances by the actors, namely Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina and Tom Holland. I enjoyed Dafoe in particular.

Direction of the plot. I enjoyed where they went with it. The ending was good and I appreciate what they are trying to build for this phase. It feels like they may be setting up Kang and they very clearly set up the next Dr. Strange movie.

Nostalgia. It was cool to see some old faces from the franchise. I also enjoyed some moments between them like talking about Tobey's mysterious web abilities. There were some really fun parts.

Peter's inner battles. Peter is a young idealist and we all know he just wants everyone to get along. He is also a very selfless character and I bought that he would accept losing everyone he knows if he believed it was best for him. It was a cool way to ""reset"" the character within the universe.

Unfortunately that is about it.

What ruined it for me: 

The Jail. Dr. Strange can just put the bad guys in a makeshift magic jail on a whim. Villains that commanded an entire movie on their own. He basically just sighs, conjures a magic jailor's gauntlet, gives it to Peter and says clean up your mess. I understand that he has lots of power that we haven't seen and magic is magic, but when things are just too easy it is just bad writing.

The Box. There is an ultra-convenient ""cure-all Spidey-Villains"" box in Happy's apartment because the movie had no real time to establish a more difficult or believable way to cure them. I was ok with the ""I cured him once, I can cure him again"" option, because there is experience to draw from. Curing those that were never cured because now they have Stark Tech just didn't do it for me.

The Arc Reactor. This was also conveniently in the box. It's like they are Russian Nesting Plot Devices. Why is it there? To power the box, sure, but really it is to make Electro want it and power the plot. I actually liked the arc reactor Electro story arc, but I didn't like how convenient it was.

Dr. Strange's behavior. You want me to believe that this guy is going to risk tearing the universe in half in order to make people forget that Peter was Spidey? He trivializes it a bit saying to Wong that ""more has been done to accomplish less"" or something, but then he changes the spell SIX times in the middle. Maybe he decides to cast it and MAYBE he decides to change it once for him, but he would have either completed the spell as is or shut it down long before that if you ask me. I know they are old pals, but he is far more pragmatic than that.

Aunt May's behavior. I can actually see Peter going off and being the na√Øve idealist and trying to save everyone. I buy that. I don't really believe that May would insist he try to save a bunch of Supervillains, let alone ones from another universe. Not kill them? Sure. Cure them and make their lives sunshine and rainbows at  the risk of the greater public and her family? not so much. This one is less egregious than the others though.

Too much. I got serious Spiderman 3 vibes from this movie but apparently I am the only one. There was a lot going on and not nearly enough time to give it a great story arc. Instead, you had supervillains phase in and out of relevance just so we could cheer in the theater when they first hit the screen. The reason the Avengers movies worked so well is because they used the other movies to inform the viewer before the movie even began. They left a partial story that just needed to be woven together in a few big movies. You had all the background. In this movie we had the pieces of the inside jokes, which were great, and we knew the characters, which was nice, but the problem was that there was no common plot. Even the characters themselves didn't understand why they were there. It all had to be built in the one movie which is why the shortcuts were taken, which is why I did not like it.

I am still excited for the MCU. There were a number of good moments throughout the movie, but the poor plot devices destroyed my immersion and my enjoyment. I enjoyed the direction they were taking the plot, but the ends did not justify the means to me. The multiverse makes a lot of sense for the MCU and I am excited to see Dr. Strange.

&#x200B;

Thoughts? Am I nuts? Did I remind you of something you liked or didn't like? I welcome the input.",ri7eum
hqyo38k,"Figured I wouldn't love this movie, didn't think id hate it. The reason I saw this was to see the old villains and Spidermen. I hoped and sort of figured that due to the more serious nature of the older Spidermen films this would also be more serious. I was very wrong and the film was pretty well just jamming jokes into every single line. I get Spiderman is a quippy character but holy crap it was too much during scenes that were meant to be more severe. It also annoyed me because I actually appreciated a lot of the nostalgia jokes but they came off more blandly since it was just too much. Last point on this is the constant jokes also came from Doctor Octopus, and The Green Goblin which was bizarre and didn't fit the already established characters. 

I thought the start to the movie was stupid. Peter shows up to Dr Strange and Strange just does what he asks? Then goes on to scold him after word? Maybe instead of doing that take some time to think it through and avoid the whole thing. 

Aunt May's death didn't resonate with me at all. I was mostly just confused that she died, seemed forced. Meaning, she was way too trusting from the get go and as a result died. I get the lesson here, and that it is her character but based on given information it was just an outright bad decision. 

In addition we have a few things that upset me due to my own lack of understanding.

- why did Lizard not come up to the apartment?

- why did Sandman go bad? I feel like if they would have just taken an extra minute to converse with him it would have been fine. Even the initial detainment of him could have seemingly been avoided.

-the memory wipe thing didnt make much sense  especially at the end.

Things that I liked:

-Andrew Garfields redemption through saving MJ

-most of the fight scenes

-Doctor Octopus becoming sane again

-some of the nostalgia jokes primarily The goblin saying I am something of a scientist myself and him breaking his mask.

Overall most of my hatred comes through the excessive jokes. That led to me feeling the movie was an hour and a half too long since most of that was just jokes. I will say that the movie clearly was not for me and I am glad so many people like it!",ri7eum

hoxg72l,"There was a lot I liked, a lot I wasn't so sure about. I'm expecting this comment to go down like a lead balloon so here it goes...

What I liked:

- This is still very much Tom Holland's movie, even with the sheer amount of things going on here he has a clear trajectory that works well on its own and in tying together his whole trilogy

- This is definitely Marvel's most nostalgic movie to date, and it does actually work, I got a massive kick seeing them all on screen again, especially Dafoe and the Spider-men

- They had the balls to both kill May and end it on a relatively dour note, which admittedly is something of a low bar for Marvel but I really appreciate them doing something riskier creatively here

- Andrew Garfield was probably the highlight for me. He  has so much enthusiasm for the role and he was clearly shafted by two terrible films. Seeing how good he is and how much fun he has made me want to revisit his films just for his performance, and I say that as someone who grew up on the Raimi films

The stuff I was less keen on...

- This has already been pointed out a lot, but I found several CGI elements to be jarring or outright bad at points. Strange looks like he was pasted in on that train, and seeing Happy at the gravestone at the end looked fucking atrocious. They really had to shoot that on a green screen?

- On that note, and this has been true for a while, I feel like the Watts' Spider-man films are borderline aesthetic-less. They have the occasional fun shot or gimmick here and there, but everything they shoot is so bland now, some scenes looks closer to television, like they had half a day to shoot something and put it all together. I don't think it helps that Spiderverse had so much personality and style and imagination

- Tobey Maguire is... fine. I know he's always had a bit of a spaced out vibe to his acting, but when he turned up in a shirt it made me think, ""This is just a pay cheque for you, isn't it Tobes?"" I think I could have been convinced he was putting in a deliberate performative  choice if Andrew wasn't putting him to shame in every scene

- Doctor Strange's wig is more noticeable with every film and I pray to the wig Gods that they eventually fix it

My only other thought on it all isn't really a positive or negative but more the question of how this film will hold up in five years or so time. 

Will new viewers care for it if they don't have the same nostalgia for the older Spider-men? Will the film actually hold up on its own merits? Or will we be neck-deep in multi-verse type films by that point that it's a redundant question? Who knows I guess...",ri7eum

hp1y46n,"This movie was a lot of fun. I love that it had the right amount of ""meta"" humor and fanservice without being corny.

I'm a bit confused by the ending though, wasn't the original spell just going to make everyone forget he is spider-man?

hp4aoyx,"I am no movie critic, and if you like it is all good. But personally I found the storyline in this story to be pretty lackluster and somewhat random?

The fight scenes were bland, if at all present. As a stand-alone movie, it didn‚Äôt really bring something new to the table. Lastly the jokes weren‚Äôt that witty in my opinion, but that‚Äôs just me.",ri7eum
hp4b345,"I like the movie, but it has flaws. 

I'm honestly confused why Venom is there in the first place. Because the movie established that people who came to MCU that they know who peter is, but Venom never interacts with Peter/Spider-Man. 

They also made Vulture know Peter's identity in Homecoming is irrelevant in this film. 

I also didn't like how they made the Lizard more generic in this movie than Amazing Spider-Man. 

Sandman just turns into a villain again for the sake of it seems for the plot's sake. I feel like you can replace him with Venom from Raimi and could set up the black suit better than the post-credit scene. 

They also mention that Peter is broke but they never show it any moment that he is struggling financially. 

But now the positive. Willem Defoe is still a great villain and the beatdown he did to Tom Holland is amazing. 

Alfred Molina is still a great Doc Ock. They improve Elector. 

It is great seeing Andrew and Tobey back as Spider-Men. Made me realize again that Andrew is such a great Peter and Spider-Man and is close to comics more than both of them. 

I like their conversation being Spider-Man is hard. I love how Andrew getting redemption saving MJ. 

The kinda solve some of the issues I had MCU Spidey like the acknowledge Ben Parker. It feels so much more consequences. 

I didn't expect Aunt May to die because I thought Happy will die but no. Hit really hard. I love how Tom Holland almost kills Golbin but Tobey stops him so he won't become like Norman. 

I like they improve the spidey sense like the scene in Happy's house. 

The ending feels very classic Spider-Man. I like how Peter is going to make his own Spider-Man suit and won't rely on Tony anymore.",ri7eum
hp4c4ov,It seems pretty stupid that in a world where the Avengers have as much power as they do that they would allow Spider-Man to become publicly vilified by a tabloid journalist. That story thread doesn‚Äôt really work in the MCU.,ri7eum
hp4ikv0,"Fun 2nd half but damn was there some bad/lazy writing. 

Spiderman releasing all villains to go back to Happy's condo. Okay. You couldn't figure out all their cures while keeping them in their prisons? 

Ned says, ""My family says we have magic!"" and is written off by Dr. Strange because of how stupid that sounds. Oh wait, it was a setup to reveal that he does have magic. It's still a stupid set up. 

Spiderman couldn't immediately let his friends know that all these extremely powerful villains are now loose and they all could vanish at the push of a button? Why even have the magical box button if the writers never use it?  

A fire grenade basically goes off by Aunt May and she's not burnt or blown up or anything. She has enough time to slowly die before giving her important lines. 

Even just the way they opened up the multiverse felt clunky. Dr. Strange and Spiderman mess up a spell? A literal brain surgeon & (former) sorcerer supreme, and a scientific genius are the reason for the multiverse opening up? Into the Spiderverse already had a cool way of doing this and I guess they couldn't rip off it, but a lot of things could have been better than this. 

Andrew Garfield was great though. I liked that they allowed him to play the part with something to prove. Redeemed a lot of poor decisions from the previous ones, including completely wasting Sandman in Spiderman 3 and basically giving him no ending.",ri7eum

hphidof,"I thought the movie was amazing, but it felt more like a sony SM movie than one that fits into the MCU.

Enough has been said about how good Tobey and Andrew were in the movie, and I really enjoyed Defoe, Fox, and Molina, however I thought that sandman and reptile had weaker entries here. It was still cool to see them come to terms with being from the same dimensions though.

I never had a problem with the goblin suit so I thought it was disappointing when it got destroyed almost immediately. We did get to see more of Defoe's great emoting, but when he is covered in body armor, being helmetless feels unnatural. Something self retracting could have been a nice middle ground. His physicality was great though.

While I can understand peoples dislike with the nano-tech suit, I as a casual viewer liked the Homecoming and end of FFH suits. I will especially miss the gliders and lenses.

I am surprised by how many people are rejoicing that Tom finally ""heard the line"", or that he ""now doesn't have it easy"" or ""is all about sacrifice"". I personally enjoyed that MCU SM had a good home life and a support network. Is it really such a bad thing that the guy was happy and had people he could open up to?

Of course May's death was emotional, but did it need to happen just to give him an Uncle Ben moment?

Especially in the MCU it felt extremely believable that someone like Stark could find out his identity with all of their resources. I don't anticipate liking SM's dual identity becoming a big part of his MCU character.",ri7eum

Such a great movie. I can't wait to see it again.",ri7eum
hpj8dc6,"Okay Okay. I think I found whats my beef with this movie. I liked it but something I felt was off. I think the movie was on a great start with the idea that Peter *couldn‚Äôt have it all* and maybe that he *cant solve all the worlds problems* and maybe its not his responsibility. Then it just switches into it is his responsibility? Like thats some sort of growing point?  Also Aunt May‚Äôs death kinda felt weird. That it just felt forced for all these other two spider peeps to have some sort of moment and a reason for spiderman to be out of character mad at the end. 

Also all three spiderman have huge plot Armor besides the thick skin they barely have. (Tom literally is maskless when he gets bombed, shoved through concrete and thrown around on metal like his skull is made of titanium)

Also, All this second chances talk would make more sense if the villains weren‚Äôt already given opportunities to not be bad in their own universes. Why is it Tom Hollands Spiderman‚Äôs responsibility to fix these choices? Dr Strange was *right* in wanting to send these people back. These villians *did* have their chance and now we are forcing them to be normal for no real reason. Just to feel like Aunt May‚Äôs death wasn‚Äôt wasteful (which it totally was. Also, Uncle Ben‚Äôs death was from the action‚Äôs of someone else not from Spiderman‚Äôs own direct choices). 

Anyway. Bleh. Maybe‚Äôs Aunt May‚Äôs death would have meant more if Peter was like, this is enough, I‚Äôm sending everyone back home and then trying to build his life back from that point and just owning up to his own universe. 

I guess you can say, since he ends up alone and an orphan that, he doesn‚Äôt go scott free. But idk the ending just feels more like Sony preparing us for more Spider-Man movies than it is organically telling a story.",ri7eum
hpjd9xs,"Anyone else confused about the morality aspect of the movie?  
Why did May want Peter to keep the villains instead of sending them off? At that point she had only met Osborn who was feeling really lost and scared to be in a universe where he and his company or anything familiar doesn't exist. To me, her asking Peter to keep him here sounded more like kidnapping than helping.  
Also, why 'save' the villains who had apparently already died in their worlds? Isn't trying to undo death supposed to be a hugely bad idea in the MCU? (considering the Dr Strange episode of 'What If' and things we have seen in Loki like Pompeii and Lamentis).",ri7eum
hpqfc91,"I just realized that this movie gives Sony an MCU exit strategy. Everyone in the MCU has now forgotten who Peter Parker is.

hprnu6t,"I liked it but didn't love it, the main problems are peter could've just had anyone he wanted to remember stay inside a magic shield strange cooked up, this shield would protect them from the spells influence.

Also the spell cast just made people forget, but all the stuff is still there, like video, photos, documents, it was not to erase him from existence. I can forget anyone but if there's tons of photos in my house/phone I'll start asking wtf who is that.

Just came back. Damn man. That was easily the best ""Home"" iteration of the spider trilogy. I didn't feel overly invested considering the overwhelming fan service, but wow. Electricity is what I can describe this movie as. It is frenetic, fast, and funny if not a little bit boring at parts. I was sort of feeling the movie's length somewhere during the villains exposition dump. But by the end of Act 2, things have been ramped up to Electric again.

This movie managed to juggle a lot in such a long package, I understand why the 2nd act is a little...slow. Not one character does not have a reason for their motivations. Everyone >! (Except Happy, I think) !< serves a purpose here. In the end, the movie doesn't forget that this is Parker's story and delivers some absolute JOY in it's 3rd act.

The film also borrows elements very recently done elsewhere and better (Into the Spiderverse for obvious reasons, but the Aunt May fate was a bigger blow in the PS4 game).

The interactions with Strange were great, although the ""Let's brianwash the world"" thing was so grotesquely irresponsible that I couldn't shake it the entire film, and Mordo saying that Strange is the villain in the trailer for Strange 2...yeah, that fits. Why not just...brainwash...the admissions person? I just couldn't get around that idiocy. Especially not mentioning other details beforehand, since that would have left him, what, homeless and kicked out of school? I was waiting for some twist to reveal that something was wrong with Strange and sadly...nope, they wrote him like that!

I also never watched the Garfield films, as the consensus seemed to be ""this is ass,"" so I was missing that emotional carry-over. It's less of an issue with something like Endgame that is effectively the end of a series, whereas this is drawing plot elements from a technically unrelated film series.

The thing that threw me off was the fact that there's alot of pointless events that happen in the movie that seem significant but have not effect at all. 

For example, why was charlie cox in the film with no other purpose than to say ""hey im still in the MCU too"". 

Or what was the point of aunt may injecting the syrum into GG? They never explained what happens to GG when he is injected. Which leads to the plot hole that GG was able to throw spiderman through concrete floors and fuck everything up in the middle of the movie to being a total pushover by the end. How did he become super weak? Was it that syrum? If it was, the film didn't do a very good job of explaining it (should have had a scene where the GG loses all his power).

It was not at all cool to read comic books or play video games and studios didn't seem to care.

I cannot express the pure joy this movie brought to me. I have not been this happy while watching a movie in a very long time. It was nostalgic, full of fan service (and I mean that in positive way because it was the best executed fan service I've ever seen in a movie) with a surpsingly emotional story at the core.

Also, I definitely think this should be the last one, but obviously there will be another one and it won‚Äôt top this.

The interactions, however, were even better than i expected. Definitely worth it just for all the fan service. Everything outside of the logic of the plot was good the plot is just so bad that it makes the movie as a whole bad, although extremely enjoyable lol. 

Not looking forward to the tired amnesia storyline. Also surprised they didn't bring in more shit. Just a little nonsensical venom goo drop is way less than i expected. 

Also missed opportunity not bringing back either Harry Osborn. 

Also, since when is Garfield's Spider-Man that great? I remembered liking him a lot but wow. Highlight of the movie. 

Also, seeing Holland's Spiderman be bailed out by Stark tech again was dissapointing. He's definitely my least favorite Spiderman and this movie left it even more clear. Hopefully the next movie really gets him going. Crazy he just got his own origin in a way now through May. It was great to see how the other Spidermen developed.

hpgssfp,"So I watched this on Saturday and have had some time to reflect. I think this is a mediocre movie, 5/10. Leaving the theater I was a bit overwhelmed by what I had watched, the movie was definitely 20 minutes too long. I certainly smiled and laughed seeing Andrew and Toby, but beyond that the movie was very hollow‚Ä¶

The direction is middling. Direction by committee is something you can clearly see in all Marvel movies, and this is no exception. Zendaya and Tom gave just okay performances. The supporting cast did good, though it felt like everyone was kept in neat little boxes to spoon feed us fanfare. The plot was contrived  drivel. The ending was strong.

I feel like this movie and marvel movies more generally are a reflection of the sad state of the movie industry. These movies are not made to be art, they have no message to convey, there is no creative inspiration. They exist solely to extract the maximum amount of money they can from the population. Income projections exist long before the plot is thought out.

I guess I just don‚Äôt get this MCU stuff like other people do. There are meaningful and moving stories being told by original authors all over the world.

But No Way Home fixed many of my MCU issues. High stakes and *real* consequences, with great fight scenes! He FINALLY becomes his own man, becomes SPIDER-MAN. I loved it. I haven't loved an MCU movie since Infinity/Endgame. 

EDIT: I have not seen Eternals yet, waiting for Disney plus. I'm going to start Episode 5 of Hawkeye, which I'm currently enjoying but that's due mostly to Hailee. She's great, reminds me of Tom. She's perfect for the role.",ri7eum

hp0j4oo,"To be honest, I wasn‚Äôt the biggest fan of Ned and MJ forgetting who Peter was. It kinda feels like a undo of all the character building of the last three movies. I understand everyone else‚Äôs excitement of course, but it just doesn‚Äôt do it for me. I also dislike the post-credit scene, I was hoping for Tom Hardy‚Äôs Venom to be a part of the MCU, and it also doesn‚Äôt really make sense that a piece of Venom was left behind. I don‚Äôt really see the current Flash making a good Venom, and don‚Äôt really want a different person playing Eddie Brock as I love Tom Hardy‚Äôs performance.

3 Spidermans was by far the best part

Andrew Garfield was awesome as Spiderman and is still my favorite in the suit (cockyness, the jokes very comic book spiderman), while I think Tobey is the best Peter Parker

Nice seeing old bad guys

Green Goblin killed it still proves he's Spidey's best bad guy

The Bad:

A lot of bad writing, Aunt May's advice was horrible

Ned magic stuff was dumb

The mirror dimension fight is probably my favorite MCU Spider-Man scene. Loved the 3 Spider-Man and their interactions. Andrew getting some redemption. The villains were good especially Dafoe.  

But everything with the mcu Spider-Man just doesn‚Äôt click for me the first half of the movie was a drag imo",ri7eum
hpc29pa,"I just saw it yesterday, and man oh man was it awesome, not only rivaled with Into the Spider-verse as the second Best Spiderman movie ever man (Spiderman 2 is still number 1) but also in my top 5 of the best MCU movie (quite possibly my most favorite MCU movie) and the best/my most favorite movie of the year, and this time I mean it. I absolutely love, love, LOVE this movie. Not only is it a great conclusion to the Homecoming trilogy, but also the culmination of a ongoing Saga that has started all the way back in 2002, and brings everything full circle with the themes of responsibility, which I feel are handled extremely well here, and the emotional and powerful moments hit extremely well, with this having the best drama in the entire trilogy, whereas Homecoming and FFH were reminiscent of the Early Diko era were it was more of a comedy, NWH is more reminiscent of the later more serious Era of Diko and Lee (or at least a great transition into it) and it really shows in the best way possible. From the death of Aunt May which was tragic and unexpected as all hell, to Peter having to say goodbye to all of his friends, knowing they won't remember him but it has to be done in oder to allow there lives to be normal again.

Defoe still got it as Green Goblin, more so then in the earlier films, he was hamming it up like crazy and you can tell he was having so much fun with the role yet again, same goes for Alfred Molina as Doc Ock and Jaime Foxx as Electro.
 
Molina also still kills it as Doc Ock, and Foxx was so much better here as Electro then he was in TASM 2, Thomas Hayden Church as Sandman and Ifans as Lizard were great too, and all the villains have actually good and reasonable motivations for why they are doing what they are doing, I was so worried and nervous they would ruined, if not destroyed Doc Ock and Sandmans redemptions by turning them evil again, but they actually do a good job explaining why they are like that again (With Doc Ock being taken out of his universe  before his death, and Lizard being taken out i assume before Peter unleashed the cure in his universe, and Sandman still being good and only joins the villains once he fins out that MCU Peter isn't his Peter) and giving them good motivations for why they are doing what they are doing, same goes for the other three. And the visuals were actually really good, especially the Doctor Strange sequences, they shined in his film and they still shine here, speaking of which I really like the dynamic between Strabge and Peter in this movie too and I felt they worked off of each other very well, and without making him a mentor too. Tom Holland does a fantastic job as Spiderman, in fact this is his best performance as Spidey and gave off so much raw emotion this time, heTRULY felt like Spidey and Peter Parker, just like he did in FFH, if not more so, and everyone else did a great job too. Especially Zendaya. Also really thought Peter and MJ were cute in this movie.

And the fan service was so awesome, and so welcoming. And of course...Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, wow, not only does Tobey Maguire still do a fantastic job as his version of Peter, proving way he is still the best Spidey, and brings in so much beautiful wisdom (and I was literally Hyperventilating when he came on screen) but also Andrew Garfield is redeemed as Spidey for me, he was so much better and he actually felt like Spiderman and Peter Parker, such a redemption after how HORRIBLY he was treated in the TASM films, it actually makes me want to see a TASM 3 now, maybe they can confirm its in the same universe as Venom and Morbius so we can give that universe a reason to exist. 

And seeing them banter with one another, gushing over Tobeys Organic Web shooters, Garfield saving MJ, comforting Peter along with Ned and MJ after Aunt May's death, and Tobey stopping Tom from killing Goblin, with no words needed, just silent expressions, was just perfect, and they all work off each other so well, especially Tobey and Andrew, you can tell they had the most fun. It wasn't flawless, the humor was still very hit or miss, and I don't really care for the Black and Gold suit, I also don't really like how they handled Venom in this film, like, at all. But the positives outway the negatives, and overall, this is the movie Spiderman fans have been waiting for for years, taking the best of all Spidey films and rolling them into one, and it's because of that this film was very satisfying and worth the wait and lived up to the hype. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who is a huge Spidey fan or Marvel/MCU fan.

Oh, and the soundtrack and New Suit Peter gets at the end is very cool too.

I'm giving this a 9/10.",ri7eum

I ugly cried when the other 2 Spideys shared their pain.

And, I woo-ed a little too hard at Matt the lawyer while everyone was quiet. Will they team up, I wonder? Tom‚Äôs Spidey could really use an elder bro looking out for him.

That ending is what being a real hero is all about.

They should have had Tobey say something like ‚ÄúI fought an alien made of black goo once, then a couple years after I fought a guy dressed as a vulture‚Äù and Tom could‚Äôve been like ‚ÄúMe too!‚Äù

I think Tony's main motivation of helping the avengers on the making the time machine for time heist is when Tony is washing the dishes and it accidentally got out of control and wet their picture together (Tony and Peter). If tony did not know peter, no emotional connection between him and peter thus, he will not push for the time heist. We can tell at the ending that he is not wearing any nanotech suit which means tony doesn't made one for him.

I think the only way that the endgame happened is if the spell dr. strange did does not affect the dead people. Only the presently alive person in MCU.

Or this is a branch of reality that the sorcerer supreme discussed way back on end game. this reality doesn't have any infinity stones in it so its a possibility.",ri7eum

Moved him to a different city, ina handmade suit, moved his friends with him, Avengers don't know about him, and Aunt May is no longer there.

I really didn't think they would pull it off, but they did.  Somehow they managed to get all these characters in and make them all feel like they should be there, no one felt like an after-thought.  The chemistry between the three Peters was great, it really makes me sad that we likely won't see them together on screen again even if Marvel does more projects with Tobey or Andrew.  I loved seeing Tobey get to mentor not just Tom but Andrew a little, and the reunion with Doc Ock was great.  Andrew really knocked it out of the park, he was always my least favorite but he really endeared himself to me here.  The whole bit with Tom Hardy makes zero sense (he shouldn't have been brought in by the spell since he didn't know who Peter Parker or Spider-Man was, and Let There Be Carnage implied he came in before the spell was even cast), but at least we got a tease for an MCU Venom.

They exist in totally different like‚Ä¶moods? Tones? Genres? I don‚Äôt even know how to explain it. But in OG Spider-Man you don‚Äôt laugh at the name Doc Ock. Because it‚Äôs a comic book movie and you‚Äôre buying in. OG Spider-Man is a comic book movie and marvel Spider-Man is it‚Äôs own thing, trying to be more grounded(??). 

But the tea is that when you throw in Tobey Maguire, doc ock, and green goblin into this movie it just makes me think about how much I prefer the OG and how much they don‚Äôt fit into this universe.",ri7eum
hpbb2u4,"Controversial opinion: all of the reprising actors could have just as easily been random actors. I felt like none of the personality or quirkiness of the Raimi characters came through in this movie, and each of the Webb villains underwent redesigns anyway. They dropped the ball in this aspect in an otherwise decent Spider-Man movie. Fan service was a priority for better or worse. I was extremely excited to see Dafoe‚Äôs return to goblin, but felt underwhelmed by his character‚Äôs writing. Yes, he‚Äôs volatile and suffers from reconciling two personalities, but his character lacks other motivation here. He exists simply to keep the ball rolling in a meandering plot. I wanted full arcs for seven notable characters when the runtime could not possibly allow for it.  It seems the writers knew this would be a problem too because they chose to have characters quote their own memes several times. None of the interactions between the villains and their respective Spider-Men were particularly compelling either and seemed only to echo audience reactions. I did think the moments when Tobey and Andrew felt some catharsis for helping Tom on his journey were high points, albeit slightly underbaked ones. I respect that the creation of this film was no doubt a massive undertaking for all involved and I commend them for their efforts. This was a monumental feat to achieve made even more impressive by the build up of hype surrounding it.",ri7eum

I want to add that we can really tell how much people watched or didn't watch, well, *everything* leading up to this movie just by the reactions.

- A majority reacted to Doc Ock, Green Elf, and Electro's first appearance. 

- Some laughed at Norman saying he's somewhat of a scientist himself. 

- Some people recognized Lizard and Sandman.

- Girls and women squealed when Andrew Garfield appeared. 

- Whole theater popped for Tobey McGuire.

- Filipinos laughed during Ned's Lola conversation with both Spider-Mans. 

- Initial mixed reactions to seeing Tom Hardy on screen, took a while for people to figure out who he was until Venom spoke. 

- Not a big reaction to seeing Wanda and her cabin house in the post-credit trailer for Doctor Strange 2. Although my husband whispered loudly, ‚ÄúSonuvabitch. They got Shuma Gorath?!""

I watched all of the Spider-man movies before watching No Way Home, and I gotta say, Spider-man 3 is a good movie (I remember not liking it because of Venom and the edgy scenes).",ri7eum
hoz0t3r,"This truly felt like watching movie history. Not only was it celebrating the character's past and playing a greatest hits album of every Spidey movie that has come before it, but it was groundbreaking in the way it brought previous continuities together and found a way to explain to the audience how the same characters could be played by different actors. Not only did it honor the previous installments, but it actually acknowledged their long-criticized shortcomings and allowed the actors to redeem their regrets. It gave the actors and filmmakers a second chance to improve on what came before, and MY GOD did it deliver. In the midst of doing all that, it somehow managed to balance and pace the arcs of three heroes, all his supporting friends, and five villains (the most any other significant superhero film had done was three, I believe). AND it had real heart. This is maybe the best superhero film of all time. It took risks while also giving the fans exactly what they wanted, it broke new ground while also honoring the past, and it kept the action full-throttle while also making the audience feel something real.",ri7eum

It felt like the whole movie took place in an apartment, a condo, and on some scaffolding. Overall I did like it, just sort of wish it maybe had a better sense of place.",ri7eum
hoz8xef,"This film fixed MCU Spider-Man in every single way. This was the origin of Spider-Man in the MCU and Aunt May was his Uncle Ben. It cements Andrew Garfield as the best Spider-Man for sure, he just is complete and absolute perfection as the character. He is just untouchable.

hozgo19,"saw this today, still processing all my emotions. my fan heart is racing. There was someone else in the theatre who I don't think knew Garfeild and Maguire were in this and they geeked out so hard when those two showed up. It was a moment of pure joy. I clapped, so they'd know someone was enjoying the moment with them. This is why you go to theatres, to hear the fan reactions. 

One of my favourite emotional moments was Garfield's Peter Parker getting to save MJ when she almost died the same way his Gwen Stacey did. He couldn't let another Peter Parker go through what he did. 

Aunt May's death was also heartbreaking but I wonder if it would have been more heartbreaking to have her forget Peter at the end of the movie. I hope Ned and MJ remember him again eventually. Looking back at moments throughout Holland's arc are bittersweet now. Remember at the end of Endgame, when Peter and Ned were reunited at school? that feeling of he's home again. Now there truly is no way home for him.",ri7eum

hp1te02,"So what‚Äôs interesting to me is just how they‚Äôve slowly educated people over the years about multiverses (not counting CW shows).

Growing up, when you‚Äôd have a superhero movie with the main hero recast there would always be people saying ‚ÄúWait, didn‚Äôt Joker die after falling from a building? Why is he fighting Batman again and look different?‚Äù Casual fans of superhero movies might not often consider that movies can have distinct ‚Äúuniverses.‚Äù

So when you have movies like Into the Spider-Verse fully embrace it, it helps. But in terms of the MCU:

*Tease it in Endgame
*Acknowledge it in Far From Home (even as a red herring)
*Easter egg it in WandaVision
*Explain the concept in Loki
*Show the possibilities in What If
*Finally use it to connect previous incarnations with one of their most popular heroes

What a great movie. An emotional culmination of twenty years of Spider-Man movies and it seemed like a love letter to all these movies. Tom Holland's Spider-Man hugging the others, thanking them profusely, Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man being able to catch MJ, Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man fixing Sandman, speaking with Otto Octavius and stopping Tom's Spider-Man from going too far was all absolutely perfect, and then I haven't even discussed the brilliant fighting scenes (Osborn vs. Spider-Man in the apartment complex, for instance).

What set these films apart was the cheerful happy fun tone it had to it.

+ How would a mindwipe spell have any connection to opening the multiverse?
+ If a multiversal drift happened, why would you entrust a kid to fix it? Why didn't strange send a wizard team to capture all the people flowing in from other universes?
+ Why didn't the literal spell to fix an entire universe not account for that one piece of symbiote goo? Don't that piece of goo also count as like a foreign entity under the logic of that spell?
+ So do the other spidermen also forget about Peter Parker? Or does the spell only work on that universe. If the spell only works on that universe, how would that fix anything? Or is it like coding where the spell's logic affect each other and spell one is like BRING EVERYONE TO PETER and spell two is like NO THING IN THIS REALM KNOWS WHO PETER IS like as if the spells themselves have some limited form of consciousness to be like aware of the identity of a specific individual?
+ Was the snowed sanctum set piece just a cool visual thing like the director just went ""I want snow everywhere it's gonna look cool"". Or is it like they can't finish the CGI in time so they just plaster snow texture everywhere, or is it like a thing where Kevin Feige was like ""Im gonna put this in there to distract the audience when the trailer drops"" but then no one took the bait?
+ Why would entering a new universe give Max a new cooler looking body? Or is it a thing of like, because being electricity makes him formless, he can be anything he wants and he chooses to imagine himself as that and when Peter like zaps him or whatever (i don't remember) it gave him a semi corporeal form?

hp98a2y,"I really enjoyed this movie and agree with pretty much everything others have said. Seeing Maguire, DaFoe, and Molina in their roles again was great and Garfield/Fox also really redeemed the legacy of their films.

One thing I didn't love was how literal the ""cure"" plan was. I know the Spidermen aren't therapists, but it seemed like the biggest issue with each villains was mental health, not powers. It was a little reductive to just create little gizmos to ""fix"" everyone in a magic Stark printer then high school lab.

I do think Doc Ock was handled well since the damaged inhibitor chip was established in his movie. For Sandman and Lizard, cures would be great but they seemed much easier to create than made sense. I also think in a world of alien invasions, these two could have been helpful if they saw themselves as potential heroes rather than outcasts. There was room for a different approach on them.

The main villains were clearly Green Goblin and Electro, and their issues weren't really physical at all. There was a lot of time spent on GG and Electro's personalities and internal issues that I feel could have been addressed differently, rather than a big needle in the neck and battery on the chest. This might be an unpopular view, but I would have liked to see Electro realize he could be a hero by helping stop GG. It would have been a good arc (heh) for the character rather than just getting his mini reactor drained.

GG of course couldn't be redeemed and live, but the idea of curing him with an anti-serum was sort of lame. I'd have preferred one of the Spidermen tried to talk him down and/or GG was again killed by his own actions like in Spiderman 1. I don't hate how his story resolved at all, but I think the idea of ""curing"" villains of their villainy was underutilized.",ri7eum

Bravo.

* You could hear the theater erupt into hype when Matt Murdock showed up. I was 50/50 on if they were going to do it or not but holy shit I was astonished when Parker's not so mild mannered lawyer showed up.

* I love how JJJ is a paper thin knock off of Alex Jones

* The Doctor Strange music started to play when Peter walked towards the Sanctum

* Spider Man beating Doc Ock simply through the nanotech and just emasculating him, the menacing villain of a whole Spider Man movie, in a 10 minute scene was something else... LOL

* The whole scene of the trapped villains was just a circular roast between all the Spider Man films and Doctor Strange LOL

* You can TRULY see the strength of Doctor Strange when he *easily* manhandles and traps the villains of almost *every* modern Spider Man film just in the first act

* Yooo, that Strange vs Peter fight was so cool. God, I love these superhero mashups. For that moment it was pretty much a Doctor Strange film and Peter was literally dragged into it (albeit with surprisingly less shock than when Strange was dragged into it in his own movie). 

* I love that they got to pull the ol' trippy Doctor Strange CGI out of the box for the scene

* ""The mirror dimension is just math"" HAHA, fucking Spider Man lampshading the whole aesthetic of Doctor Strange 1 lol

* Spider Man beating Doctor Strange *in the mirror dimension* is something I never would've had on my bingo card

* Ned's lola in that scene is fucking gold. Filipino representation! So glad that Ned is also Filipino in the MCU.

* Green Goblin is fucking devious. Willem Dafoe plays this role hauntingly well in this film.

* Anyone else get the same vibe as in that Doctor Strange *What If...?* episode where >!Dark Doctor Strange implodes the universe!< when Strange's cube is shattered and he's desperately struggling to contain the literally visible cracks in reality.

* The theater (and I) ERUPTED INTO SO MUCH FUCKING HYPE when Garfield's and then Maguire's Spider Man showed up

* The others being completely baffled at the concept of The Avengers HAHA

* I literally got *chills* down my spine when I saw the 3 Spider Men swing in unison from the Statue of Liberty

* I literally said ""oh no, not again"" when MJ fell off the Statue of Liberty. Thankfully Garfield's Spider Man was there. üò• How cathartic for him.

I was hoping a better story to do with how he would deal with being exposed by Mysterio and where to go from there.

And the thing I hated most was just how right Jameson is where he states how the reason Spiderman is a menace is because HE brings the danger wherever he goes. Which is true in this case unfortunately for him. 

Most comic movies have that going for them, but. It would get boring if every hero just did street crime vs normal people endlessly. Even look at Dragonball for expample. Even Goku knows him existing just means even more powerful villains will come to exist.

That said, the action of toms spidey screwing stranges spell to cause the main plot of the film still made for a great movie and I can sum it up as a love letter to the past Spiderman films 

I wish or hope the mulitverse intertwines more in the future as it's a shame to loose that connection now it's been made. I loved how electo knew he was in a new universe just from feeling the electric, him coming back and feeling Thor's thunder would be a sick scene as he got a taste for the MCUs arc reactor

Also if you know of the comics and know of the brand new day retcon bullshit, then this movie absolutely did a better job. In the comics it's a deal with the devil and he takes MJs love as the fee so they never get back together (not sure if that's still the case)

All that was because of the civil war events so the MCU timeline is skewed but that a great thing and it makes for a new experience not just a copy paste of the comics

My only other comment is that the premise felt too similar to Into the Spider-Verse with the multiverse, past spidermans and villians coming back, etc. I don't know how closely related the two movies are. I don't think Into the Spider-Verse is canonically apart of the MCU but I could be wrong. I can't help but feel like they saw how successful Into the Spider Verse was and decided to make MCU movie with the same exact idea.

hp6fiau,"I have super mixed feelings about this one.  I love the ending and how they've essentially rebooted MCU Spiderman, and he can still work for the Daily Bugle to pay for college, that he sacrificed himself for everyone's benefit, all that shit.  I loved how they ""fought"" the villains with trying to resolve their trauma; that's something pretty unique and not something you normally see in MCU, and I loved how dealing with the villains was basically a fight for Spiderman's soul

I didn't love how much banter there was.  The quipping between the villains, the casual conversations between the Spidermen.  I get it.  People are attached to the Raimi Spiderman and like to see that Pete has grown from his mistakes and can mentor Tom Holland Spoods, but it just felt like it was wasting time in the movie

Overall, I think it could be leading towards a Spiderman series on Disney+.  Lower stakes, back to basics, something like what we saw in the early 90s Spiderman cartoon.  Wouldn't be surprised if no Spiderman in any Avengers shit this phase, then later comes back for a  Venom movie (likely Flash in this universe, right?)

Also, really *really* thought one of the after credits scenes would be Electro back at Oscorp seeing their new intern, Miles Morales",ri7eum

Garfield & Fox were definitely the weak contributors of the film. Though I did like the detail nod to the comic book Electro with the lightening appearing around Fox's head. And Garfield nailed the emotional moment when he dives to save MJ. To no surprise, Dafoe just dominated every scene he was in. One detail that caught me off guard was that when Strange returns from the Mirror, he is wearing The Eye. Did anyone else catch that? Because I don't remember him wearing it earlier on.

It is going to be impossible to recreate and bring together all the things that has made the Spiderman movies great over the last 20 years.

Though the multiverse sounds interesting, and the future movies will probably explore that, for me I feel I've got the closure I needed for Spiderman, the only superhero I closely followed and cared about in the MCU.

I also feel that they should have waited to release this until the pandemic becomes an endemic like the Flu (I've stopped considering that Covid will ever end, we'll just treat it as a flu and get vaccinated annually eventually), even if that meant waiting until 2024-25.",ri7eum

&#x200B;

I did not think this was a good movie.  More so than most other Marvel movies, the plot just doesn't hold up, and the movie just kinda forgoes logic in order to get to the next scene that they want to do.  It's fun fanservice, but I could not get behind the story at all.  For example, Peter feels so strongly about his convictions that everyone should be saved, who he knows to be villains and has no connection to, that he's willing to fight Dr. Strange, his actual comrade, and leave him stranded in the mirror dimension(and he doesn't know what the fuck that is) and take away his sling ring, possibly leaving him there forever?  That's where the movie officially lost me. I got plenty of other problems with it but like I said, overall the movie is fun and I liked it. I think?",ri7eum
howlwv2,"Thoughts on the film:

Marvel hasn't really being doing it for me lately but NWH was a lot of fun. 

Willem Dafoe was over the top which I couldn't help but love. Alfredo Molina was also another highlight. Jamie Fox was a better Electro this time around. I kept laughing when Sandman was on screen because he had no purpose...he just wanted to go home. Like Sandman, Lizard really had nothing to do. The movie would of been better without them and while focusing the core 3. 

Watching all three Spider-Man actors on screen was surreal. It made for the perfect mix because I always found Tobey's Peter a little dry as he lacked the comedic side of Spider-Man, but here he bounced off of everyone else while being the straight man. The line about Harry dying in his arms was the line that killed me. Watching Andrew made me miss his portrayal as Peter. While his Spider-Man movies weren't great, he did make for my favorite Spider-Man himself with a mix seriousness and banter. This is where Holland suffers for most part because there's just too much comedy injected into his Spider-Man. Although Holland does get some scenes where he plays that tragic side of Peter that was needed in this movie. 

The plot itself was weak. I wasn't convinced that Aunt May would want Peter to help these villains. She came off as way too naive. None of the villains really did anything bad beside Goblin and even then he killed one person and did some property damage. I think there was some one off comment about Goblin at some army tech site but it really didn't explain where he got his upgrades. Electro wanted electricity I think. As I mentioned Lizard and Sandman weren't needed...Flint just wanted to go home. Doc Ock was fixed early on. So I'm not really sure what the end goal was or why they even worked together. 

Despite it's flaws, I think it made for a nice send off for everyone. Peter ending up where Peter should be - a broke ass student in a homemade spandex suit.",ri7eum
howr6ia,Thus movie really showed me how awful the writing in the amazing spiderman was. Andrew was born to play spidey but he was held back by two awful movies,ri7eum
howzau9,The Amazing joke was great. The chemistry was great. I think my favorite cameo was easily Matt. The one I expected the least. Also I love just Tom Hardy down in Mexico being himself. Probably my second favorite Spider movie besides Into.,ri7eum
howzho5,"I enjoyed the movie. I‚Äôm a bit against the consensus in that I didn‚Äôt enjoy the explicit fan service all that much though. It was funny, but it did take me out of movie in a big way.

Also, this movie definitely felt like it was a separation point for Spider-Man and the MCU. All of the interesting wrinkles that made this version of the character grounded in the MCU have been entirely stripped away, and instead the story has been morphed into the traditional Spider-Man set up. It is very clear to me that Sony wants Spider-Man back under their control.",ri7eum
hox2xa3,"I think for a very long time, we‚Äôre going to point to this movie on how to do fan service without absolutely fucking it up. First of all, they got me with Charlie Cox and I was so excited; once I teared up I never stopped being completely dry eyed I think

It‚Äôs amazing to me how my entire childhood was unlocked and I remember watching Tobey in theaters and thinking THAT was the coolest. And I loved Andrew but he just didn‚Äôt get enough time and great material, so this really felt like a redemption for him. No wonder he walked around with movie poster with a huge ass grin lol.

The way the story used the villains was not what I expected. I think MCU has got me always expecting a certain‚Ä¶storyline format so this was a breath of fresh air. Kind of the way Black Panther was.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm something of an actor myself.‚Äù I honestly felt the spirit of Reddit when that line came out of his mouth.

Wouldn't it have made some sense just to like...stick around and explain what just happened? They had to cut away at that moment where the spell was cast because you literally couldn't explain your way out of it on screen.

quick review and opinion of nwh
The movie is quite slow. 
And Holland Finally learns to fight. He lands a punch for the first time.
Andrew Garfield Steals the show, Willem Dafoe is wonderful as usual. Having Tobey is simply a cherry on the top. There's a good amount of Raimi Memes in the Movie. The background score music is pretty disappointing to me. They could have actually used original character themes better, it would have been more impactful. The cinematography isn't that great.Honestly i feel jon watts is a sub par director. Tobey and Andrew were under utilised. The final fight doesn't gave me the chills of three Spiderman fighting together, which into the spider verse does better.He could have put some very good Money shots such as Three Spiderman suit ups and many more, still no proper swinging montage of spidey.Simply wasted potential. The movie is a pure fan service and does very good at it and i liked it. But as far as a how good the movie stands in entire Spiderman franchise, i would say second.  Spiderman 2 is still the best Spiderman Movie. The movie retcons a lot of stuff and is kinda soft reboot at the end. I am quite excited for the future Spiderman movies to see how it pans out. Being a solo hero and no reliance on stark tech very much entice me",ri7eum
hoxb4ev,"Felt like throughout the movie, they were just roasting Andrew Garfield‚Äôs Amazing Spider-Man and I was all about it.",ri7eum
hoxbrpv,The awful humor ruin one of the best scenes ever (tobey and andrew entrance).Im sick of marvel s humor,ri7eum
hoxc3p8,"I have never seen a movie before and had one of my first reactions be, ‚Äúplease show me the gag reel!‚Äù  I want to see all the Spider-Men and Villains riffing off each other.",ri7eum
hoxiu1o,tom hollands peter moving into tobey‚Äôs apartment was the icing on the cake for me. all time moment,ri7eum
hoxk058,[deleted],ri7eum
hoxl7uk,"I appreciated the fact that they fixed the Sony Universe (by un killing their villains)  AND paved the way for a proper MCU Venom. 

If Sony is wise, they‚Äôll continue to use Andrew and/or Tobey going forward

I really liked that it gives Ned, potentially, back to to Miles Morales.",ri7eum
hoxlerv,"Nobody seems to be talking about Nick Fury being off world, yet he was in Far From Home

That motherfucker was a skrull.",ri7eum
hoxmdgx,"Unpopular opinion, but I really hate the direction they took at the end with the wipe. I liked that this Spider Man was different than the rest, and there were more people in his life and he wasn't just alone and broke in NYC. This has kinda killed my interest in Spidey going forward. 

That said, basically a flawless movie otherwise. Everyone's said it already, but Molina, Tobey, Dafoe, and especially Garfield just ran away with the show. So good. As great of a send-off as this was, it really makes me want to see more of these interactions.",ri7eum
hoxpo3e,"Movie was incredible, all the villains were great but I hatttteeee memory wipe endings. Something about just changing who people are on a fundamental level is super villainous",ri7eum
hoxpzfm,"It was a good movie but it rode too much in nostalgia and fanservice very *The Force Awakens *, the CGI was sloppy and the plot has some wholes but somehow it was enjoyable? I‚Äôm surprised that they gave a big role to Ned and MJ, Happy wasn‚Äôt needed they need to get ride of him.",ri7eum
hoxrzv1,"The moment the fight scenes were gonna get serious, they added a joke.. I mean it's good but I expected some serious moments too.. there were too many jokes in the movie.. but I do appreciate the aunty may ki death scene, tom fighting Norman scene, each Spiderman talking about losing special people in their lives and all!",ri7eum
hoxxhhw,"I for one really liked the movie, I just had a bit of an issue with the ""character arc"" of MJ.  
 The whole ""Always assume the worst"" felt a bit forced, the way they introduced it and resolved it via dialogue.   
IMP it would have worked really well if, in the end, Peter tries to talk to MJ again, he tries to finish her sentence with ""always expect the worst"".  
But instead of agreeing, she retains the lesson from the Statue of Liberty fight, stays optimistic.

My wife thinks (and I agree) that Doctor Strange gets swapped out for an alternate Doctor Strange within the film as when we first see him he is wearing a hoodie, no necklace, seems relaxed and shows kindness to Peter. But later Strange is shown to be wearing his iconic outfit (w/ necklace); something the alternate was aware of and stole the look as it is his most commonly associated with Strange. That‚Äôs why the other Strange could be getting angrier, annoyed a lot faster as he is not use to dealing with others.

We already know another Strange will appear in the sequel but maybe he‚Äôs be right under our nose this entire time, could‚Äôve even waited for Wong to leave as he knows he‚Äôs the sorcerer supreme and didn‚Äôt want to be noticed.

hoyuiy0,"I wanted more Matt Murdock and Spider-Man interaction, honestly. 

I liked the movie, but I do feel like the Mcu misused Spider-Man. They shouldn‚Äôt have revealed his identity like let him live two lives with the people he cares about knowing. Or at least have holland‚Äôs Parker stop revealing his identity to everyone. I felt like the biggest flaw in their characterization of Spider-Man is that he needs to be liked by everyone. Maybe that‚Äôs why it feels like hes just a kid or little brother to the older superheroes. I‚Äôm glad they ended it how they ended it, he should be on his own and build his own reputation and grow up. Not build it off of tony stark/ nick fury/ or dr strange. Throughout his movies, he hasn‚Äôt proven to be a hero on his own. Even in this movie, he‚Äôs dependent on two other Spider-Man franchises. This trilogy did feel like an origin story for this Spider-Man, but where do they go now with the character in this universe? The things that he had like family and friends are gone so what does he have to defend. And like they can‚Äôt do doc ock or green goblin for a while and that kind of sucks. 

Ohh another thing, why‚Äôs damage control not on Spider-Man‚Äôs side. Like why isn‚Äôt anyone defending Peter Parker/ Spider-Man? Where‚Äôs the avengers? Fury can‚Äôt make a phone call. Mysterio was a bad guy and a liar and could have easily been traced back. He had an employment history at stark industry. Stark used his tech on stage. Come on, happy. You have one job in charge of security. I get JJJ and the daily bugle maybe subverting the narrative but there would have been an opposing news source to counterbalance. 

I liked the movie, the three spider-men were great. The villains were great. I didn‚Äôt see the logic in curing them! Or that they came back when they came back and tobey being older and still coming back, did the spidermen die and that‚Äôs why they came back when they did. Those logistics don‚Äôt make much sense.

Just a few thoughts/questions I have: 

- Everyone's acting was absolutely fantastic. Tom, Willem, Alfred, and Andrew being the standouts. 

- Loved the chemistry between Tom, Andrew, and Tobey. They really did feel like brothers and the scene of them hugging in the end made me tear up. Also when MCU Peter was thanking and saying goodbye to the other Peters, you could tell it was also Tom thanking Tobey and Andrew for the impact they had on him. 

- Andrew tearing up after saving MJ made me want to cry. Like he was somehow able to forgive himself for not saving Gwen. 

- The whole science lab scene with the three Peters was amazing. 

- The two physical fights between Peter and Norman were fantastic and brutal. The slow shot of Peter grabbing the glider and approaching Norman was so well done. 

- I'm do glad we actually had meaningful and comedic interactions between the three Peters and it wasn't just Andrew and Tobey showing up for the final fight. 

- Loved that the three couldn't fight well together at first but eventually made it work. 

- I wish an epic rendition of the original Spider-Man theme would have been used when the Spideys swung in unison.  And then have their own individual themes blend into each other. 

- The ending was incredibly bittersweet. I want more of this Spider-Man. 

- Realistically, could MJ and Ned get their memories back? If so, how? How much of their memory is missing? Was Peter erased from stuff like videos, pictures, specific memories, etc? 

- If they want to bring Ned and MJ back, how would they do it if the two are moving to Massachusetts? I kinda wish their top school would have been Columbia University so they could stay in New York and so it would be easier to keep those characters close enough to use, but not close enough to Peter (if he ends up going to ESU). 

- Could MJ realistically figure everything out and get her memories back? 

- I wish Aunt May's grave would have been next to Uncle Ben's. To give Uncle Ben some acknowledgement. I swear Peter acts like he never had an Uncle. Not even when Tobey and Andrew bring their Uncle Ben up did he say anything about him. 

- I hope that now that Andrew's PP knows that his variants were able to find true love with their MJ, that he goes and finds his own MJ. We know MJ was supposed to be in TASM2 so I hope she exists somewhere and they find each other, even if we don't get to see it. 

- The way Peter bluetooth-ed his way out of the bridge fight with Otto was hilarious AND the way he used Geometry to get out of his DS fight was also hilarious.

It all the most roundabout way to get a symbiote into the MCU. It just makes me hate Let There Be Carnage even more since the post credit scene in the movie amounted to nothing.

hp5eruy,"Can we actually talk about Willem Dafoe, because he is a superhuman actor. I am serious when I say that I legitimately have NEVER felt actual discomfort, unease and fear from a movie villain before. Let alone an MCU villain. Holy shit, that man is a RIDICULOUS performer. The scene where he snapped and the Goblin came out has left me tilted. It's been 2 days since I've seen it and I'm still tilted. What the fuck. Wow.

This movie was actually incredible. I've seen it twice now and I can say without a doubt it's a fantastic and honestly *miraculous* piece of work. The fact that this even exists is mind-blowing enough on its own, but even if you look past that, it's a well-made movie. The ending got me hard. The MCU is notorious for having boiler-plate template formula movies with no lasting consequences, but holy fuck - the ending to this movie was nothing I could possibly expect. It's so incredibly tragic that I found it funny how upset I was, because I never get this upset at fictional movies. But that's how heartfelt this film is. Honestly a masterpiece. Not just because of Tobey and Andrew being there, but because of what it represents.

Big complaint of Tom's Spider-Man has always been that he has it too easy. Has access to Stark tech, has Happy Hogan, private jet, help from the Avengers, got to go to space, etc etc. The ending took all of that criticism and blew it out the water. He literally has nothing and nobody now. I can't imagine anything more tragic for Peter Parker than to be in complete isolation. Even from the people who used to love him. It's a terrible fate and a horrifically bittersweet finale to his story arc. I loved it as much as I wished it didn't have to exist.

The only complaint I would have maybe - all of this coming from a goofy spellcasting fail by Doctor Strange seems a bit underwhelming. None of this would've happened if he had simply told Peter what the spell would do before he started casting. I would've very much preferred if, in the post-credit scene, we found out that Dr Strange didn't actually fuck up, but broke the multiverse on purpose because he was possessed by Mephisto or Doctor Doom or something like that.

&#x200B;

But yeah, other than that - this is an incredible piece of work. Music at the end made me fucking cry when Peter was saying goodbye to Ned and MJ. Literally unbelievable that this kind of crossover actually happened, the idea of 3 Spider-Men meeting across universes used to be a meme, that's how unattainable it was. I personally never believed it could actually manifest.

I know these corporations are motivated by money, and I know movies are nothing but a distraction in the end; but there is some part of me that greatly appreciates this nonetheless. Behind the executives and faceless boards tossing around cash and contracts, someone thought of the sheer wonder and excitement people would experience watching something like this, someone advocated for this and made it happen. Yes they might've done it because it would sell, but so what? It's still incredible. And the quality of the movie and script proves that this wasn't just a cash-grab crossover. The people making this actually cared about it.

8.5/10; took points off because of missed opportunities during the final fight (Tobey and Andrew's themes were criminally underused, also no proper shots of them suiting up or putting their masks on, which would've made the audience detonate).

&#x200B;

Second is as Strange is casting the spell that actually works to make everyone forget Peter. Peter looks at Strange and says ""Do it."" The first lego he puts out? Palpatine.

Like, you spend all that time in the previous movies making some amazing, likeable characters, and you just kill then off? Are you kidding me?

It just seems like a lazy way for Sony to cut ties with Marvel, which is a real shame.

Overall, while this movie was pretty good, I feel like it's mostly because at this point I expect marvel movies to be disappointing, so it's not as bad when I watch them and they are actually disappointing (funny how that works out, with that being said in the movie lol).

As much as I enjoyed the pay off of going in blind to the fact they were in the movie, I would have also loved to see both Tobey and Andrew on the press tour, it would be amazing to hear what it was like wearing the suit after all this time - especially from Tobey who seemingly hasn‚Äôt appeared in much for almost a decade. 

I also watched Matrix 4 a few days earlier and it really opened my eyes to how poorly executed that was compared to Spider-Man. Reading the behind the scenes info, it seems like the producers moved mountains to give us all the Spider-Man movie we all wanted to see.

Fine film. The cinematography was much improved over the the previous films and the film had emotional weight even if the MCU level humour did mitigate said weight at times. It was nostalgia baitr but it was still respectful despite some issues.

Being a massive fan of Raimi's first two films, I was pessimistic about their handling in this film. Whilst I would've liked to have seen Sandman's struggle a bit more given his daughter and knowledge of who Peter was, he was still shown to be in a dichotomy. Goblin and Ock were the best villains in the film although I would've liked to have a more scenes of his Goblin persona conflicting with Norman.

With this number of characters in a movie, Marvel has somehow managed to make it look cohesive and not crowded, which Sony has failed to do it twice. They've successfully integrated fan service into the plot. Overall a fantastic Spider-Man and MCU movie.",ri7eum
hp1b1ia,"What I liked:

 ‚Ä¢ Willem Dafoe‚Äôs Green Goblin. Despite him not playing the character in nearly two decades, he fell right back into it as if it was only yesterday. Not only that, but he was arguably the first villain in the Home trilogy who I genuinely felt scared for Peter Parker. Michael Keaton‚Äôs Vulture and Jake Gyllenhaal‚Äôs Mysterio were more ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt bother me, I won‚Äôt bother you‚Äù kind of guys, Green Goblin actually sought out to ruin and kill Peter.

‚Ä¢ The heart and dramatic heft. A major issue I had with Far From Home was where it seemed almost every moment had to be punctuated with a joke. This movie laid on the heavy stuff, and it did not pull its punches, it didn‚Äôt try to end on a lighthearted note, nor suggest that Peter will reconnect with his old life. It was a welcome change that I hope stays in the next Spider-Man trilogy.

‚Ä¢ The acting. This is honestly my favourite performance of Tom Holland in the role to date. Not saying he should win any awards for it, but I could tell he was really putting in the effort and not just playing ‚Äúthe dorky teenager‚Äù archetype. Same goes for Zendaya and Jacob Batalon, I loved how there were moments where each of them got to shine.

‚Ä¢ Doctor Strange. His role almost mirrored that of Tony Stark in Homecoming. He tries to mentor Peter the best he can, even if it causes them to butt heads, and ultimately leads to the erasure of their history together.



What I didn‚Äôt like:

‚Ä¢ Some of the humour. I don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs so funny about the name Otto Octavius. Was it supposed to be a meta joke about his real name and his villain name? Regardless, I thought it was dumb, and the scene felt forced.

‚Ä¢ >!Tom Hardy‚Äôs mid credits scene. They went through all the trouble setting him up in Let There Be Carnage, only to send him back before he makes any headway. Maybe he‚Äôll be brought back, maybe Holland‚Äôs Spider-Man will visit his universe, who knows. (This is more of an inner fan complaint then a criticism of the movie)!<",ri7eum

This movie had Tom‚Äôs best acting to date & Garfield proved that he would have been remembered as the best Spidey if it wasnt for the poorly made crap that was ASM2. Toby was great as the elder Spidey too.

Andrew saving MJ was great closure for his character and got the biggest cheer of the movie in my theater.

Im glad that even with all the fan service, this still felt like Tom‚Äôs movie and was a great ending to his trilogy. Im excited to see where it goes next, especially with that awesome looking suit he made in the end.

Actually deserves the Best Picture Oscar. They merged multiple universes into a coherent film.

Also, is there cancer in the MCU? A teenage boy can fix a sand monster. Why is there still disease here? This is a mindfuck for me.

Garfield rescuing a woman the right way...that moved me to tears. Moved his Spidey to tears too.

Maguire is charismatic. He's a dick in real life, but he is damn charismatic. I didn't realized how much I missed him. His back line is a joke from his attempts to get more money out of Sony by claiming a back injury.

But X-Men did a climatic Statue of Liberty fight first. Putting up a shield would kind of desecrate the monument. Spider-Man does damage a lot of monuments. Damn him.

Everyone gets a moment, a time to shine, and some action to them, even if Ock and Gobby get a majority of the screentime. One of my favorite moments is just all the villains sneaking into Happy's apartment, and it leads to just Peter hanging out with much of the villains and just trying to do good and help them.

hp0o4ce,"Highly enjoyable. The action, nostalgia, and acting were overall nothing short of amazing.  
  
That said, I do have some issues.  
  
\-- I'm still confused about why dr. strange casted the spell. being aware of the consequences, why would the defender of the universe be convinced to do something he knew could be multiverse shattering. This is the guy that told Tony Stark he would stop at nothing, absolutely nothing, to protect the time stone. When did Strange get soft?  
  
\-- Furthermore, why didn't he brief Peter on the full extent of the spell? It might of been useful to remind Pete that this spell would remove the memory of Peter as Spidey from everyone, including his close loved ones. Just seems to me that they needed Dr. Strange to act out of character to make the whole movie work.  
  
\-- I liked the idea of Aunt May convincing Peter that the villains deserved a 2nd chance, but at the same time I feel its a bit problematic as these are displaced villains who they have no real knowledge of. After everything they've been through, exercising a bit of caution when dealing with enemies from other universes is just a given. I just felt the film tried too hard to push a moral message without considering the circumstance.  
  
\-- Since when did electro get all swagged out? It would of nice to at least see a little explanation of how electro went from being the socially awkward oscorp electrician to a swagged out jamie foxx with a new hair cut.  
  
\-- Pacing was very off for me. It seems to start out fast, then slows down, then speeds up again in a way that felt jarring.  
  
\-- Where is the Holland Peter's Uncle Ben?  
  
Things I loved:  
  
\-- Wilem Dafoe killed it as Goblin! The acting and action, oh man was that a delight to see. And his outfit? It looked almost identical to his comic book/animated series look! I loved it! Peter vs Goblin was freaking amazing!  
  
\-- All the Spider-Men scenes were just a treat. The charisma was so on point. The dialogue worked so well. I was never a big fan of Garfield's spidey, but boy he sold me as Spider-Man in this.  
  
\-- The nostalgic moments were super fun. All the little nods to scenes from prior movies as well the glimpses at the comic accurate spidey villain sillohouttes -- just plain amazing. It was great seeing Garfield spidey save MJ.  
  
\-- While I can't say I'm fully on board with the inciting incident in this film, I must say seeing a humbled, more matured Holland peter is exciting. I'm absolutely stoked to see what comes next. His new suit is IMO the best alongside Tobeys'.  
  
Overall -- I highly enjoyed this film. I can't say its the best Marvel film, nor the best Spider-Man film. I can honestly even say it was a bit disappointing. The story rests on a pretty rocky foundation; as said before I can't really suspend my disbelief and accept that Dr.strange had no qualms about performing such a powerful spell for Peter. What this film really excels at is giving a series of fun and nostalgic moments. I'm not mad, it's a fun ride. I just wish the story went in a slightly different direction.",ri7eum

(1) the first line, just like the last movie, should have been ""-uck?""

They should have had Ned and MJ in a relationship, so that he is afraid to break up their newfound happiness together.

Holland hasn't just lost May, he's the only one to lose his parents, uncle Ben and May.  


Also, that was really dark. I think we tend to gloss over Tobey killing who he thinks killed Ben out of sympathy, but it's really very dark that he just murdered him. Somehow I misremembered it as him webbing him up, but maybe that's Garfield. Which would mean both Spider-Men already did the redemption arc - I felt like Tobey's was the least actually redeeming.

hovdpsq,"Obviously was incredible but truly I think this was the funniest MCU film to date, so many jokes just landed perfectly.

My only gripe against an otherwise perfect film was that Maguire getting stabbed meant nothing, felt thrown in there for the sake of a cheap shock moment that only got resolved by two quick gags. Not saying I wanted him to die (although we obviously won't be getting a Spiderman 4 either way) but would have meant more for it to have been resolved some other way.

Edit: Also let's greenlight Amazing Spider-Man 3 already!",ri7eum
hovf1x3,"I loved Andrew Garfield in TASM & the sequel I thought he was the perfect spider-man at the time. In fact I was a bit disappointed when they announced a new one for the MCU when civil war came around, but I grew to love Holland as well. This film was everything I wanted out of a spider-man film, I loved all 3 spideys, but Andrew‚Äôs performance & true love for the role solidified my view that he is the best of the 3. Oh, and his redemption saving MJ was a tear jerker for sure!",ri7eum
hovfa42,"Really enjoyed it and I sat through the horrendous Far from Home to see this since Marvel was doing something different here. It's fan service cranked up to 11 and I think anyone who is been watching Spider-Man since 2002 would reminisce the moments when they watched it the first time. My first theatrical experience was Spider-Man 2 so I teared up a bit seeing Doc Octavius and Tobey. It's also kind of surreal seeing different versions of the characters on the same frame, like who would have thought about this a few years ago. Marvel benefitted so well from all those previous unfinished Spidey franchise.

But my reservation is that it won't age well. Few dialogues are there just for the meme content and in few years we would look at few scenes and say that MCU hired the writers from HISHE. Also, Tom Holland is still the blandest Spider-man.",ri7eum

hovgiz6,"It was so nice to see Andrew Garfield return. His child-like excitement to be back as Peter Parker really came through. Plus his redemption of catching MJ? That activated all kinds of emotions for me. Incredible.

He's the most underrated Spider-Man in my books and I'm happy to see him get closure, especially because of how disappointed he was when Sony called it quits and shattered his childhood dream. The same thing can be said with Toby and I liked his return as well, but in real life, it seemed to hit Andrew much harder because he loved the character so much.",ri7eum
hovhhtu,"It was so great seeing all three spidermen. They each bring something new to the table, they have their own mannerisms and ways of speaking.

All the villians were great in their performances but it got a little bit dull during the capturing and curing and betrayal stage. I think that hinders the emotional impact of May's death.

With that being said, it picks and the fun and excitement once the other two Spider-Men come. All that stuff was great. 

I would give it a 7/10",ri7eum
hovklqn,"I know people want another Garfield movie after this one but by the time it actually got done, he‚Äôd be 40 or older. This was the perfect way for him to show people he was a perfectly good Spidey. No need to ruin that.",ri7eum
hovkngl,"I loved the culmination of Tom Holland‚Äôs journey as this character. That new costume, listening in on the police scanners, having no Avengers or friends or girlfriend anymore, and leaping out into the night to do the right thing anyway. Pure, classic Spider-Man. I can‚Äôt wait to see where he goes from here.

One thing that I absolutely would love to have an explanation for though, and hopefully now that the movie is out, the actors can actually talk about it now: what on Earth was up with Sandman and Lizard in this movie? Halfway through I was convinced that it had to be voice doubles for them, because I couldn‚Äôt come up with one good reason why they would have those two stay permanently in their sand/lizard forms and never turn human apart from their cured state. But then I check the credits afterward, and sure enough, it was indeed Thomas Haden Church and Rhys Ifans? So, what gives? Took me right out in certain scenes.",ri7eum
hovkoyk,"They gave May the Fitz treatment.

Agents of shield fans know what's up",ri7eum
hovkpei,"Goddamn, was that a spectacle of a movie. Really cool the subversions they did on classic Spider-Man stuff to really make Tom Holland's Spider-Man uniquely different from the others.

Like the ""Great power"" line being told by Aunt May instead here I think is fantastic. In hindsight tho, I think it would've been cooler if May keels over saying the first half of it, then Tobey finished the line while Holland is distraught over what happened and what May's last words were going to be.",ri7eum
hovkpiq,"Brain dump below. TLDR: I fucking loved it.   
  
\-Looking back, Holland hasn't really felt like Spiderman for me until this movie. The real loss and pain is core to his character, and Holland's performance in this one finally put him up there with the other 2 for me. I personally didn't rate this version compared to the others until this film, but he was definitely on equal footing by the end. Meeting the other Spidermen AFTER losing May was a perfect choice, as seeing them share their pain was a great way to build their relationship quickly.  
  
\-of course, the Spideys teaming up was pure joy. All the call backs, fan service and nods all landed perfectly for me and I was grinning the whole time. I was waiting for a grand Endgame-style entrance for both, and I'm really glad they did it in an understated way. 

\-All of the Spiderman interactions were just soooooo goooood. Garfield cracking Tobey's back, comparing web methods, talking about their exploits, supporting each other. All absolute fucking gravy  

  
\-The film deserves credit for somehow making this work at all, and I overlooked the clunky plot beats because of how damn good it was overall. And I really like that all of the plot devices are actually in line with what we've seen in other movies to help us suspend disbelief (eg the fabricator, Strange's powers etc.)  
  
\-Garfield was the perfect Spiderman IMO and I'm so glad he got the chance to cap off his version. His playfulness, his pain were all perfect. Catching MJ and tearing up was a really good moment. He absolutely sold his short performance and I'm so glad that his version got some well deserved credit and closure.  
  
\-I actually thought Tobey got overshadowed pretty hard. His take was pretty laid back, which was OK because it helped balance the crew and it felt like his arc was complete prior to this film. But of course I'm just glad we got him back and it worked well enough.  
  
\-the plotline of Peter wanting to save the villains was surprisingly effective. There were a few instances were this felt silly (considering...that they're villains) but it gives Spider Man that extra responsibility (pun intended) and empathy for others which is the crux of the character. 

\-the apartment scene where Peter's spider sense is going off was fucking great. Really built the sense of dread for...  
  
\-Dafoe.....so fucking good. I knew his heel turn was coming and I didn't care, he's just too damn good in the role. And seeing him overpower Peter and smash that building apart (with minimal CGI) was my absolute highlight of the whole movie. The final fight was pretty good too and finally seeing Peter go all out against an opponent of equal strength was sick  
  
\-I didn't love the final twist of everyone forgetting Peter, and this strongly felt like franchise course-correction rather than an emotional plot point. I am excited to see Peter with a blank slate however, as the continuity has gotten extremely messy (which got a few funny nods in the film)  
  
\-Ock's arc was weird overall. That first fight was good but he was just....there for the rest. I think a bigger focus on him and Goblin at the expense of the other villains would've helped the film.  
  
\-the inclusion of all the other villains felt a bit greedy and unwieldly, considering that their arcs were kinda done. I wish they'd instead focused on the key ones, and maybe warped in the other villains at the final fight to save some screen time. I guess they were committed to Sinister Six (I think i saw a sixth cell??) but then didn't really go all the way. Which brings me to....  
  
\-Venom wtf!?!? I was waiting for his appearance, and now he's back out of the MCU? I'm extremely confused as to what they're planning here (besides Black suit spidey) as from what Feige has said, it sounded like he was joining the MCU. I'm wondering if Venom was supposed to join the final fight in early development, and they changed course and booted him out again? It's going to be a stretch to warp Spiderman to the Venomverse for a battle and then back out.  
  
\-I'm guessing Thomas Haden Church's appearance is too different from when he last played the character? I'm pretty sure those shots of him after his cure were from Spider Man 3.",ri7eum
hovku1r,"I never really liked Hollands Spider-Man films, but man this movie was a complete 180 for me. Everything was so well done. One of my favorite moments was his fight with Steven. I‚Äôm sure this film will go on to break some records.",ri7eum
hovl1xv,"I forgot how much I hate being in a movie theater with certain types of people. My theater had multiple flashes going of during the spidey reveals. Just wrong on so many levels. One for everyone else in the theater, you‚Äôre distracting from an incredible moment and two, I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôre going to post the pics to social media which will ruin it for people who didn‚Äôt get to the first showing. 

People with toddlers way too young to control non stop talking and even walking in the aisle. Fucking light up shoes and shit. 

Loved the movie though, just wish it wasn‚Äôt so hard to be fully immersed because inconsiderate people.",ri7eum
hovl2lm,Does Dr Strange remember Peter Parker or did he forget too?,ri7eum
hovl7q2,Why did they not show sandman in his human form until he was cured? seemed weird for him to be in sand mode for 99% of the movie.,ri7eum
hovlblk,"I am very positively surprised with this. I enjoyed it a ton.  


We've seen a ton of movies pop up recently that are just blatant nostalgia bait. They have no story and attempt to fill the void with ""Point and Clap"" over and over. Examples include TFA and Ghostbusters Afterlife. They're soul-sucking and devoid of anything resembling a unique personality.   


Those movies lowered my expectations for this a bit as I was expecting them to do the same. Marvel & Sony absolutely could've done that and received the same dickload of money this film will make, but they actually put some effort into this and did fan service correctly, which is extremely hard.   


The plot was interesting, subversive, and refreshing. Three adjectives I would rarely use to describe a Marvel film. And (most importantly) the fan service was weaved into the story in a way to where it was actually tangible. The characters actually feel like they have a reason to be doing things that can often become ""Say the line, Bart!"" and I appreciated that they did this in place of just creating more passable sludge that everyone will consume.  


8/10",ri7eum
hovldf8,"I‚Äôm so glad I went to this movie with a good crowd. Seeing Charlie Cox again was a huge surprise, everybody in the theater went crazy.

I grew up watching Tobey as Spidey so seeing him again made me feel like a little kid all over again, I was hit with a surge of happiness because him as Spiderman was my first ever glimpse into the superheroes world, I was only 5 and Spiderman was just pinned in my mind as my favorite superhero till this day. People in the theater were cheering when the portals opened up, and I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling throughout the third act.

One thing nobody in our theater caught. When Electro says something along the lines of ‚ÄúI wish there was a black spiderman somewhere‚Äù, my mind went straight to Miles, and that line wasn‚Äôt in the script for nothing.

I‚Äôm so glad I stayed off the internet in the days leading up to the release. This movie had everything I would want in a Spiderman movie, and everything they hid took me by surprise.",ri7eum
hovll4r,This is officially my favorite Marvel movie of all time. It will be hard to top this.,ri7eum
hovllxw,"While all the villains were pretty much the same versions as the originals, i feel like they completely changed Electro's character for the better, he was so whiny in the Andrew's movie and felt like he had no direction as a character, but Jamie Fox had some of the funniest lines in the movie and completely turned him 180 and i hope he returns now , the ""i thought you were black"" joke made my cinema erupt with laughter",ri7eum
hovlrpt,"All in all, I thought it was great. Something bothers me about the ending, I feel like we have more ground to tread with MJ and Ned as characters. I think this is going to derail those relationships and our next three movies are going to be sterilized because of it. They pivoted way too hard from the Iron Man Jr. complaints. 

I‚Äôm still happy we got what we did, this was beautiful. I just hope it doesn‚Äôt harm Spider-Man going forward.",ri7eum
hovlswa,"Garfield's spider-man used to be my least favorite. After seeing him again all those old memories of the amazing spider man series came back and I realized that most of my hatred came from the anger of him replacing maguire and he was actually a fantastic spider man. At the same time, I've grown pretty sick of tom holland's spiderman.",ri7eum
hovlt6c,So so so sooo good. Maybe recency bias but this is def a top 3 maybe top MCU movie. Just a perfect trilogy and story for the current iteration of Peter Parker and closure for the other 2.

The Morbius trailer includes an image of Spiderman, and Michael Keaton's Adrian Tooms/Vulture. Making Morbius as being set in the MCU.

One thing that I couldn't not think about afterwards was, how did Peter get all the villains out of their forcefield cells after trapping Dr. Strange?

hovmsgu,"I said in another post that I think MJ felt a connection to Peter even if she didn't understand it, but I also think on some level deep in everyone's subconscious they remember Peter Parker and that will be something explored if they make another MCU Spider-Man.   
  
Like the villain has bits and pieces of information about Spider-Man that he remembers and targets MJ or Ned or both.

It had all the fan service we wanted and somehow did it so it wasn‚Äôt over the top cheesy. Yes there was meta jokes and silliness but it really just added to the movie. I laughed, I cried (seriously, a lot), I cheered, I was stunned (beating Dafoe almost to death with no music, üòØ), just‚Ä¶wow.

hovrr1r,"Seeing it in a packed cinema with so many people clapping, cheering and woo-ing at all the great scenes that others have already mentioned here really made it that more special. Can‚Äôt wait to see it again to experience it once more.",ri7eum
hovry0f,"This is such an amazing movie, and one of the best movie experiences i have ever had. Might have to do with the first theatre visit in a long time, but the movie itself is really good. 

It has both warmth and seriousness, but above all a big heart.

Probably my favourite MCU movie and definitely the best Spider-Man movie.",ri7eum

In Spider-Man (2002) as Norman dies, he asks Peter not to tell anyone that he was the Green Goblin. Peter kept his secret until the 3rd film, where Doc Ock was already dead.

How did Doc Ock know that Norman was the Green Goblin?

EDIT: Just want to say, I still really enjoyed the film. Maybe the best Spider-Man movie ever but I know some people are going to gripe about it.",ri7eum

hovszg7,"I can‚Äôt say a lot of moments were unexpected, but they were heartfelt nonetheless. Like Garfield saving MJ. I think a lot of us that saw the trailers expected that, but dang was it bittersweet.

All the interactions between the Spider-Men and other characters are so good. Truly the Avengers: Endgame equivalent for Spider-Man. How we get to certain plot points aren‚Äôt fully logical, but everything is done so well it‚Äôs hard to knock the movie for the few flaws.

I also like the sort of soft reboot of the lore. In the Garfield and Tobey movies we know that barely anyone knows who Peter Parker is, so the ending of this movie seems to be a cool ‚Äúreset‚Äù back to those basics while making it make sense.

SUPER excited to see the additional ramifications throughout the coming MCU movies.",ri7eum

hovt98k,"Honestly. Holy shit. The way everything came together was great. Great pacing throughout, had a hard time finding a spot to go to the bathroom. Willem Dafoe was unfreaking real. Having Tobey as an older and wiser spider was spot on. We finally got to see the real Garfield spiderman which was AMAZING. Honestly just everyone in this brought the best they could and it was truely an awesome experience.",ri7eum

hovtspb,"I‚Äôm torn about the ending. I kind of dislike it because I liked seeing a Spider-Man that was different from the previous two. Tom Holland‚Äôs had the nano suit, is an avenger, has intriguing relationships with other hero‚Äôs etc. but know it kind of feels like it‚Äôs all taken away. I get that they wanted to move in a direction where Spider-Man is creating his own story without having mentors or things just handed to him. But it king of feels like nothing he‚Äôs done in the mcu matters. And its moving towards having the same style Spider-Man story as the previous two spider man.",ri7eum

hovu3xe,I can‚Äôt believe aunt may got slimed y‚Äôall,ri7eum
hovu44w,I thought it was out of character for Dr strange to go along with this plan so quickly. If he didn't there wouldn't be a movie but still.,ri7eum
hovu461,"They really focused on who and what spider-man is and can do. 
Spider-man is ultimately the strongest marvel character, the fact he beat dr.strange the earth protector. Spider sense + genius mind + superman physicality, human potential. 
They kept Holland injured for the rest of the second half movie is a great way to increase intensity rising into his origin story. So much depth. I hope ya‚Äôll got to experience it in Dolby Cinema it beats imax out the water. This movie made me feel I was in it. Multiverse ftw.
We are all spider-man. They‚Äôre counting on us. The mask always fits. We choose.",ri7eum
hovu913,"Movie was great and all but two things that I have a main gripe with this film, how dark the fight scenes were and how they keep their masks on. 


The first fight with Doc Ock has to be the best one because you could see everything. I wish they extended the fight with Green Goblin because at least they show his mask. They end up cutting it short and we see the mask for two scenes. 

The fight with Electro, at the Condo and the finale was all at night with the last fight happening dawn.

Like you can have some of these fights happen at sunset. You could also have Electro go god mode and ascent to the clouds and electrify everything underneath him. This would light up the sky like massive fireworks. During his god mode, they can keep having his electric mask on because we only see it in two frames. (He stops going god mode because he accidentally shocks the Lizard and Green Goblin and they tell him to stop.)

Green Goblin could also be in this fight instead of showing up last minute as well. He could have a little nostalgic moment with his Peter Parker. 

I honestly think that we see Spider-man's mask for less than 10 minutes in this film and we have 3 of them. This is what I have gripes with Marvel Studios is how they don't let their heroes keep the mask on. It's so frustrating that they keep putting the back on and off and on and off at the finale. 

Like they shouldn't have the mask off at any part of the last battle because it make any sense. Maybe at the end Tom Peter can take his mask off to Norman and be like 'I want you to see the face to the man that kills you!'.

But it's just really dissapointing that this film and the trilogy is more a Tom Holland Peter Parker trilogy than a Spider-Man one.",ri7eum
hovueze,"I really liked the ending.  I like what i think you call poetic endings.  Many times in this trilogy Peter Parkers actions and mistakes are annoying..but I Guess he is just a kid after all there still in stories need to be consequences.

I like how at the end he decided not to tell MJ who he was..he realized that it could either wait or she was happy as is for now.",ri7eum
hovum40,"I thought the film was amazing, but I can't get past the thought of what happens to the others in their universe. If green goblin never dies, does Harry still turn evil and die?",ri7eum
hovun5b,The Venom tease in the end technically got us a Sinister Six,ri7eum
hovuryc,So is tobey with his mj or is it still complicated‚Ä¶?,ri7eum
hovusev,"I never bought for a second that Kevin Feige would let the Sonyverse be canon to the MCU, and I‚Äôm glad the post credit scene proved me right. It seems like they‚Äôre going to share Venom with Sony, like how they shared Quicksilver with Fox. I‚Äôm just confused as to how Vulture and Venom are both in the same universe as Morbius?

hovxr5y,"I don't think alot could be done to make this movie any better other than some minor nitpicks but I do feel the climax was feeling a bit lackluster and should have had one more villain to up the stakes. I honestly think with the theme of Tom Spiderman possibly on a blood rage could have been explored with Andrew Spiderman... By introducing the other goblin from his universe. Hear me out, peter just lost his aunt to the goblin, and Andrew Spiderman lost his Gwen to his goblin, it could open up an opportunity for Tobey Spiderman to teach the others about going to the dark side etc. It can also put mj in danger and also have Andrew save her and still get his arc fully realized. Just my personal opinion. I'm sure if you guys want a more detailed opinion I be happy to give it but I think for a movie this hyped it should have had more at stake and more villains.",ri7eum

how15sz,"9/10 for me. 

I've seen every Spider-Man movie with my dad and got to continue it again tonight. Also was the first time I got to see a Spider-Man movie with my fianc√© so this was a great experience. 

Willem Dafoe was fucking insane and brutal and I loved it. Was bummed he smashed the mask though, wish it would have been broken in battle or something. I'm a fan of the mask but Dafoes face was needed for this Goblin. Alfred Molina back as Dock Ock was awesome and the bridge fight was so damn good. Peter hacking the arms was so unexpected.

Tom's acting was phenomenal. When he was out for blood, my heart broke.Then he still showed mercy, and still made a sacrifice after all he lost. This was such a good Peter Parker story. 

MATT MOTHER FUCKING MURDOCK. After this and Hawkeye I'm so excited for the MCU to have DD back. Hope him and Spider-Man team up soon. They are my favorite team up in the comics. Charlie Cox has said he would love to do it too. 

It was a weird choice for Sandman to be sand the whole time. But it is what it is. 
Lizard was underused but I loved what I saw of him. Glad we got to see their faces at the end. Jamie Foxx was good but something was off about his lines to me. His action scenes were awesome. Liked his little nod to Miles and I hope he comes in soon. Electros action scenes were awesome, and the nod to his comic suit was so damn good. 

I was grinning ear to ear when both Andrew and Tobey came in. My entire childhood was there, I'm so happy this exists. They all looked so damn good in their suits in the final show down. My jaw dropped when Tobey's Peter got stabbed. I was gonna be pissed if they killed him off. 

Andrew stole the show for me. I'm glad he got to save the girl this time. Felt like the ""I'm still worthy"" line from Thor in Endgame. Loved it. Would love to see him come back and do Spider-Man again in the Sony verse. 

His classic suit looked amazing at the end but I wish we got a still shot of it to get a better look at it. 

The Dr. Strange battle was super cool, and can't wait to see Multiverse of Madness. I'm so happy we are going full cosmic this phase.

Its such a good time to be a Spider-Man and MCU fan.",ri7eum

Normen kills a scientist with a throw, he sends Spider-man flying with one punch and a kick with enough force to break a lamppost after.

Who knew this would be the film I needed after a disappointing 2021?

It was made all the better by the total fanboys and girls at the back of the cinema shrieking at those key monents, which we don't usually do in Scotland.

I think this is top spot on my marvel film rankings. Nostalgia, bit of poking fun at itself and hitting all the right marks for the tragedy of spiderman forming who he becomes.

Spiderman and batman always want to help their foes but the villains just can't shake it off. I felt this film covered that amazing, i was looking forward to seeing how he would help the villains - and that was before multiple peter parkers turned up.

how8q2j,"My one genuine complaint is I really don't like how the ending with Tom and Norman went. Peter KNOWS Norman needs help and is actively working on a cure. He knows the Goblin personality traits over at times and is pretty much separate from Norman's original personality at this point. He's seen Norman offer to help and generally be fully cooperative and kind, and fearful to be sent back to die. Peter spends the whole movie, YET AGAIN, trying to learn the lesson that he has to do things even if he doesn't want to because it's the right thing to do. Believing in rehabilitating these people. 


 So the Goblin kills May and Peter is understandably upset and filled with rage. He lashes out at the Goblin. I hate that he had to be stopped by external factors instead of an internal change. When Toby first grabs the glider, even with Toby between it and the goblin, Tom is still pushing down. Even though they literally have the cure ready. Tom's Peter never truly learned the lesson, he was just prevented from doing it. Even after everything May said and the other two Peter's said. I would've liked to see him grab the glider, be about to finish him off, and hesitate. Long enough to have Toby stop, and take the glider, just to have Tom hatefully inject Norman with the cure. To just have him accept that the right thing to do is cure him despite the personal rage, and that killing him would go against everything he's currently trying to do.",ri7eum

Doc Ock in SM2 is still my Spidey CBM favorite supervillain, but in NWH he was the first to be redeemed and turned to Spideys' side, thus weakened his arc in NWH. I have to give MVP supervillain to Dafoe's Goblin, such a compelling menace and superb acting from Dafoe.",ri7eum

howbjr5,"Dafoe, Molina and Garfield shine in this movie.They bring such a presence and gravitas to the movie. I cannot understate how much of a threat Goblin was in that movie and that was due to how he was portrayed. Was great to see Tobey, JJ and Matt back as well.

Was a real shame that Venom didn't do anything (especially after that Venom 2 credits sequence). That spell also feels like that Marvel has written Spiderman out of the MCU. I've heard Sony and Marvel will still be working together so I'm really interested in seeing what happens later.",ri7eum

I'm more of a DC fan than Marvel, but I just love Superhero movies in general and this was the best kind of fan service. Such an incredible movie and some amazing performances from Dafoe, Garfield and Holland. Molina was great too. The interactions between the 3 Spidermen were great and I can't believe they were able to pull off such a massive movie with these many characters, so so well.

- The visuals + fight choreography seemed like a significant step up from what we've seen before via Watts

- The character dynamic was on point, really hit the whole nostalgia feelz

- Zendaya's MJ Watson won me over, idc if the red hair is missing lol

- Pacing was handled flimsy in some parts, but props to Sony for that effective marketing. The lack of footage made the character interactions feel fresh  & added to that whole unexpected event feeling

- And finally, Spider-man using da brainz. The whole mirror fight sequence with Tom getting the upper-hand with the power of science was choice",ri7eum
howejb3,Is it me or was there a huge plot hole? Ok so when the movie started the pulled doc oct from his time (Spider-Man 2) just before the moment he drowned meaning everything from that point on hasn‚Äôt happened yet but then in the end they asked what was the weirdest thing they fought and Tobey said he fought venom (in so many words) but how has he fought venom if that was a while after spider man twos ending and this was supposed to be happening basically as Spider-Man 2 ended right?

howh24p,"I have a theory. In the post-credits scene we see Eddie and Venom teleported back to their home universe right as they learn about superheroes in the main MCU-616. Venom then says ""We'll have to go to New York and see about this Spiderman"", but they are teleported.
Which means they might still go there to investigate and find a spiderman, but it won't be Tom Holland. It might be a CERTAIN BLACK SPIDERMAN that the movie teased earlier (Ultimate universe where Peter Parker dies).
Also venom blood is gonna find main universe Peter Parker and we'll probably have Black-Suit as Peter struggles to make it work alone without Stark tech",ri7eum
howh37s,"So maybe I‚Äôm wrong here, but Spider-Man can go connect with the remaining avengers at any time still right? The world only forgot about Peter Parker right?

howii1o,Tobey reminded me of Peter B. Parker from ITSV just not as depressed,ri7eum
howik7n,"I may be in the minority here but this movie only felt great once the other Spider Men were involved. And that's... certainly a problem. I frankly felt it was disjointed, and thought the plot would have been far better suited should the reason to reach out to Strange have been more based around May and Peters wishes to offer her a better chance at regaining a normal life. She, after all, seems to have sacrificed a lot for him, and yet she seems to play second fiddle to that of his friends for a good portion of the film.

I guess my point is, with Holland - I don't care for his relationships with his friends and such because I haven't been given reason to care. With Tobey and Andrew, I understand who they are and what their love ones mean to them. Tobey's May was loving, a tad stern at times - but the grounded compass that he needed throughout every film (which was showcased in a handful of scenes rather than a single one that only seemed to exist as fuel for her departure). Andrew's May was willing to call out his bullshit, and even chastised him whenever he was out of line. She also never hid her worries, nor sugarcoated her pain from him. What of Holland's May then? Why didn't we ever get to see her more paternal side, why only elude to her issue with Spiderman in a throw away line from Peter saying that it was difficult when she had initially found out? How about Mj for that matter? Tobey's Mj never had the love nor care that Peter could offer her from her home life, and she clearly grew to love him slowly rather than all at once throughout the first film. Gwen and Andrew were absolutely smitten with one another, an organic attraction that grew from Peters attempt of stopping Flash from bullying another kid. Which only escalated when she realized how noble he was as a hero. Michelle however, I'm not sure... I suppose she thought he was cute? They're simply in love because the script says that they are, and Tom and Zendaya simply fill in the blanks in the real world I guess.

What I mean to say, in the end, is that this film falters because of the lack of setup from Holland's Peter. And it's saving grace is made up from past characters whom we understand and care for - because they're set ups were brilliantly given to us even if their individual films were misses.

I wonder then, if not for Andrew and Tobey - or even Defoe for that matter, would the reviews be as gracious as they are? Who came out of this film applauding Holland when the collective seems to be acknowledging what a great cultivation this was of the Amazing series, or the Raimi trilogy? The answer? Hardly anyone from the looks of it.",ri7eum

I'm guessing they didn't get Rhys Ifans or Thomas Haden Church because their cure scenes looked copy pasted straight out of the original movies.

It still worked perfectly.

I think were some obvious deleted scenes.  The Peters looked way too comfortable walking into another Earth and they mentioned that Holland's Parker contacting them.

howq2m9,"It was a great movie, but the multiverse aspect keeps me awake at night.

So are all villians from a different universe, so every previous non-MCU Spiderman movie (Tobey, Andrew) is different universe? So lets take Tobeys Spiderman Universe. I mean Goblin is from Spiderman 1, Dr. Ock is from Spiderman 2, Tobey himself should be from Spiderman 3, since he talks about ""fighting alien goo"" (Venom).  Right?

So when they, like, get teleported back, they do not end up in the same universe? So Goblin ends up in Spiderman 1 (but is now a good guy) and Dr. Ock back in Spiderman 2 (also as a good guy). And Tobey is back in Spiderman 3, where all of them are dead anyways? I also thought that Tobey felt that Tom needed help, because Goblin and Ock are missing from Tobeys universe. But this cant be true, when all of the are from different universes (since thea are dead?). 

And also bringing them back as good and alive people, wouldn't that also change the timeline/mutliverse? And where exactly do they end up? E.g. Goblin back in the end-fight with spiderman? Or in the same timeline but some time later, where the Goblin 'got away' or something?

Quick question about Venom:  


I haven't watched the Venom movies, but I was under the impression there was no Peter Parker/Spider-Man in that universe.  If that's the case, how could he know that Peter Parker is Spider-Man and be transported to the MCU?",ri7eum
howy46o,"I believe that by ‚Äúfixing‚Äù the villains, when Spider-man appears again they will be back to their own villainous self, but Peter will know that bad guys are flawed and he will want to fix them again.

Not sure if this is an oversight or I am forgetting some details on SM2 already hmm.

hox1uyp,"Ok I've had time to decompress after that monster of a movie and have my thoughts. It was amazing... there were some of the loudest crowd reactions I've ever heard (aside from Cap wielding Mjolnir, ""Avengers Assemble"" scene in Endgame, and Thor's appearance in Wakanda in Infinity War) and for good reason.

* Charlie Cox casually joining the MCU with 0 preamble - expected this to happen in Hawkeye but fuck was I happy to see him. Easily my strongest reaction during the film
* Willem Dafoe was amazing 11/10 acting - the GG mask definitely ruined his potential 20 years ago
* Sandman and Lizard played such minimal roles, they were really there to round out the bad guy bingo card IMHO - Flint really just wanted to see his kid again, so maybe he was supposed to bring in the emotion for the Spideys
* From the Trailer drop I just assumed it was Andrew Garfield's spidey saving MJ and was so glad he got that redemption moment
* Papa Spidey played by Tobey was amazing. People will praise Garfield and Tom Holland for their performances, but this movie was made by the few words Tobey did say. I mean he literally only had to stare at Tom to get him to toss away the GG glider. 
* Ned trying to get Tom Holland's attention in the lab was hillarious. It was definitely a jab at the Spider-man meme and it was well constructed
* ""With great power comes great responsibility"" got me right in the feels. I've been waiting for that with Holland's Spider-man. 
* I was REALLY expecting ""he who remains"" to pop out from one of the cracks in the universe. Obviously there is still the potential he's out there, but we'll see
* So which Symbiote do we think that will be the next Spidey villain after Venom left some of himself in the MCU universe? Is it just Venom?
* Holy cow I did not expect a full Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness trailer. I'm now hyped as fuck.",ri7eum
hox1v96,As soon as I saw all three I just knew the 3 spidermen pointing at each other meme was gonna be a scene.  It was subtle but it was there.,ri7eum

hox1wov,William DaFoe still has got it as the Green Goblin.,ri7eum

hox28ie,"I know it's far from sustainable but if they made three different universes I would consistently go see all three. 

Tobey Maguire as spider-dad, balancing his crime fighting with his new family life, maybe handing the mantle over to mayday at some point; Andrew Garfield as classic can't catch a break spidey, remaining positive through even the darkest struggles; and Tom Holland as the young ultimate/big universe spidey, complete with team ups and larger world implications. In my dreamest of dreams we'd see viians hopping universes and Tobey fighting michael keaton or Garfield fighting mysterio

I‚Äôve had thoughts that Doc Oc and Spiderman would create their own Netaverse Revengers in their World!! 

Though I wanted Happy and May to be together forever!!! A few little Happies running around!! 

Our Theatre cheered and clapped when Andrew appeared!! It was a ‚Äúto your left‚Äù moment!!

This is a movie that tied it all together. It made all the Spidey‚Äôs legit to their own personal fandom. Each one got so many scenes!!

hox76h0,"God knows how they pulled this off as well as they did. 

Every single character had its own, excellent arc, and even with Tobey and Andrew they picked up their characters and brought some closure (Tobey is still with MJ!!! Andrew got redemption after letting Gwen die!!). It's pretty much the ultimate Spider-Man film. The whole thing about CURING the villains and not defeating them was so meta and subverted the genre so well. They took a premise that could've been just pure nostalgia and they made something very smart, human and touching with it. Loved every single second of it. Also loved the balance between how dark it gets and how funny it still is. Very funny, and very emotional (Aunt May :'llll).",ri7eum

hox7f9l,Anyone else find Thomas Haden Church looked strange when he turned back into human form at the end?

hox7q04,"As many have stated, it was so awesome for the film to be self-aware about the public perception around Garfield's movies and for him to be sort of insecure and self-deprecating about it. However, I haven't seen anyone comment yet on maybe my favorite subtle exchange when they're assigning which Peter is 1,2, and 3. Garfield's delivery of ""Peter number 3!"" was so fucking funny, like ""of course I'm number fucking 3!!""",ri7eum

They didn't undercut emotional moments with their patented marvel humor and really let those moments breathe on their own for once. They balanced it out perfectly imo, making it less formulaic, and it made this movie my favorite of the entire MCU",ri7eum

I grew up with Maguire as my Spider-Man, then was in college when Garfield was Spider-Man and it felt like the movies matured with me in a way (still love those 2). Then Holland‚Äôs Spider-Man felt immature again, and I didn‚Äôt have that same connection. I liked him, but he felt too much like a kid and I felt like they were forcing him into the Tony Stark‚Äôs successor box. But after all he went through in this movie, and the ending with us seeing him completely by himself and as an adult, it really hit me pretty hard. Now I can‚Äôt wait for more of him as Spider-Man, something I wouldn‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd ever say if I told myself that after Far from Home.

With Daredevil confirmed in-universe...does that mean the Hawkeye series storyline was happening concurrently?",ri7eum
hoxf3x5,"I got into reading comics with the Bendis/Bagley Ultimate Spider-Man run and this is the first MCU movie that gave me that same feeling of watching a very human hero deal with non-Avengers stakes while bumping into a million cool characters across the city. The inclusion of Dr. Strange and Matt Murdock gave me that feeling of a New York teeming with superheroes. 

And then on top of all that, we got to experience closure of the previous two trilogies with the inclusion of Maguire and Garfield. Everyone got their closure except Holland's Parker: Garfield's Parker got closure over Gwen's death by saving MJ; Maguire's Parker got closure over Harry's death by stopping the glider; Doc Ock got closure by being able to become a hero; Norman got closure by being cured of the Goblin; etc etc. 

It paid homage while remaining its own thing. And it was so wholesome! It really was a capstone on this trilogy. The main complaints about Holland's SM were around his not quite fitting the bill: his character never really had to suffer outside of eventually losing Tony; Uncle Ben's death wasn't his fault; he never had to worry about money or technology with his relationship to Tony. Now he's all alone, broke, and nobody knows who he is. Turns out this whole trilogy was just setting up the classic Spider-Man in the MCU. I hope he gets lower stakes looks these next few years. Maybe some Daredevil cameos, stuff like that.",ri7eum

hoxhi3c,"I love how they stay true to the spiderman roots in every way in the new rendition. Tom has his own set of villains, his own stories, his version of loss that makes him spiderman, and his own way of losing MJ.

So heartfelt watching Alfred, Willem and Jamie reprise their roles and just enjoy it. I don't remember a non avengers movie get this many cheers from fans. 

Also Andrew Garfield just bloody killed it. Makes me think he had so much potential to be that spiderman. And most of all, svery villain got fixed and got their send off, as a sort of closure to the old movies in this universe. I'm glad the villains got their nice character arcs.

The audience was going crazy (maybe a little too much) but it was certainly entertaining when people were screaming the actors's names when they showed up. Especially Charlie Cox.

I was hoping they'd explain if any other Heroes would back up Spider-Man during his whole ""Everyone knows my identity and thinks I killed Mysterio"" phase but I noticed nothing. Only thing I could think of is maybe there was Skrull involvement that prevented it.

At the end of the movie when everyone forgets who Peter is, couldn't he just go back to Dr. Strange and convince him that he casted the spell to make people forget who he is?

Also for a lot of the former spiders, the movie felt like a big redemption for them like the curing and the bridge saving.

The very premise of this movie is sort of stupid. They even hang a lantern on it. Peter goes to Strange to change the memory of every single person on Earth before he calls the MIT admission board.

But even ignoring that‚Ä¶ Dr. Strange begins the spell without ever consulting with Peter about how it‚Äôs supposed to work. Even knowing at that moment that Dr. Strange himself will forget who Peter Parker is. That is‚Ä¶ weird. That‚Äôs the kind of oversight that would take an epic comic series to explain. Or maybe it‚Äôs just a plot hole.

Additionally‚Ä¶ Aunt May‚Äôs belief that Peter needs to change the fabric of the multiverse because a handful of supervillains deserve the chance to be fixed is very close to being proved false. Because that belief kills her. And that‚Äôs an interesting concept to me, but they don‚Äôt explore it.

Aside from that, there are some really solid moments. Norman‚Äôs heel turn is legitimately creepy and compelling. Jamie Foxx is good in a role that is relatively minor. And Andrew Garfield is great.

Tobey Maguire looks old.

Peter‚Äôs decision not to tell MJ and Ned at the end is very thoroughly in character. I appreciate that.

hoyu0a3,"I just wanted to ask, because idk for some reason i havent liked the MCU spiderman movies as much as i'd thought and as much as others seemed to have.   


im not sure what i disliked, but i think i wished some of it was ""darker"", which i really felt in the Toby Mcguire spiderman. the part in the first movie (tom holland) when he's trapped under the rocks was my favorite part because it seemed really ""real"", you remember hes just a teenager, but that scene wasnt long enough to me. in this new one, even aunt may dying i dont think hit as hard. you can see his anger in the fight with green goblin, but i dont think you see his anger enough for it to feel really good about the fact that he cured him, despite his anger.  


also the whole, with great power comes great responsibility thing is true, and great. i dont know if it's a great idea to lure them to the statue of liberty, ya know? only to end up destroying it. it felt kindve forced. and seemed irresponsible. i dont know if it was a good idea for him to just ask Dr strange to make everyone forget him, like what if he made them just forget spiderman, would that not suffice? was there no other way? Dr.Strange even helping him feels irresponsible, it doesnt seem like something he'd do for a teenager.  


when he's irresponsible its hard for me to figure out if its bad writing, bad pacing or him being a teenager and i think that difference is what makes me kindve feel weird about alot of his actions. if it werent for the other spidermen and dr strange agreeing to what he'd asked, it would seem that most of his decisions for this movie were based on him being young and brash.  


it also feels as if, throughout the tom holland movies its like all of the adults become people who either go along with a teen or ignore him. when they ignore him, bad things happen, it makes all of the characters seem a bit irresponsible again. in movie 1 it seems like they try to fix it by implying Tony stark called the FBI agents on Vulture, as if the fbi could do anything. they do little things to make sure you know Stark is kindve listening to spidey, but why didnt he just send his ironman suits after vulture if he knew where he was.  


then as he dies he leaves a teenager some glasses with the power to target people from satellite? and then ""they"" use the fact that hes an irresponsible teen to make it seem plausible that he'd be tricked into giving them away. its like to keep the pace moving in the movies, they all of a sudden go back to him being a teen or they rely on people not listening because he's a teen, but then can go back to having like Dr.Strange doing multiversal dangerous magic to help him, despite him being a teen. like twice.  


he also bests dr strange? and then he leaves him in another dimension like ""idk how long he'll be there"" like bro... you left him in another dimension and kept his way of getting out, and then all of a sudden they just portal him out on accident at just the right time. so spidey is trying to help cure all these villains while he left his friend in the mirror dimension like thats just okay?  


am i nitpicking? i mean i dont think the movies are ""bad"" persay but i feel like theres alot of character inconsistency   


in the third movie i think id have enjoyed it if Toby's character was a bit more ""dark"" as well.  


i think them him not just making everyone forget spiderman is just so Tom Hardy's Venom still has a reason to know who ""spiderman"" is.",ri7eum

I really don't know how they can do another trilogy and make it as engaging, although I guess going down the MCU path you can bring some of the 'less cool' villains creatively (Mysterio from the early 2000s games was a weirdo with a metallic voice in a Filthy Frank-like green skinsuit; Mysterio in the MCU was *amazing*). But I don't know, making... Kraven the Hunter a major villain for a film would be a bit weird. I really hope the Venom stuff doesn't drone on, or that they'll spice it up to not steal the Venom series' spotlight (maybe have the MCU symbiote become Anti-Venom or something, or only symbiote Spiderman). I feel like they teased Miles with Electro and his uncle back in Film 1 for a reason, so I guess they'll team up in the trilogy.

But yeah, I don't know, I don't see what villains they can bring in. Don't get me wrong, there's a *lot* of Spidey villains, but bringing in 'The Wasp' and 'Hobgoblin' or something like that would be hard to pull off. They've brought in most of the Sinister Six and lots of trump cards they now can't play (or they can significantly reinvent the character for the MCU version of that character, I guess). Catwoman as an ambiguous anti-hero could be cool.",ri7eum
hoz2ocf,"My brain breaks when I think about where the villains go at the end.  Back to their original timelines in 2002-2014 or back to the 2021 versions of their timelines since for some reason that was where Tobey and Garfield were from. 

Think about option 1 first‚Ä¶ they go right back to their original timelines:

- Electro returns to 2014 version of the Garfieldverse where Captain Stacy is dead, because of Lizard, but maybe Gwen Stacy lives

- Lizard returns to a 2012 version of the Garfieldverse pre-Electro where presumably Captain Stacy doesn't die, and maybe Gwen lives. 

- Sandman returns to a 2007 version of Tobeyverse where both doc oc and Norman are dead. 

- doc oc returns to 2004 version of the Tobeyverse where Norman is dead 

- Norman returns to a 2002 version of the Toberyverse where doc oc is still alive, but has yet to become doc oc. 

So it effectively creates 3 splinter verses with 3 different Tobey Maguires‚Ä¶ none of which grow into the old man we see in this movie.  Also creates 2 splinter verses of 2 different Andrew Garfields, maybe both with a Gwen Stacy and one without Gwen's dad... neither of which ends up being the Andrew Garfield we see in this new movie.  And there‚Äôs a chance that if they return mid-battle with spidey, some may die anyways. 

Here‚Äôs the alternative.  They all just inexplicably jump to the present day 2021 versions of their worlds (since that‚Äôs where Tobey and Andrew came from for reasons unknown).   Well in that scenario, it‚Äôs like they all have been blipped for 10-20 years after having been pronounced dead.  And also, by now news has probably come out about what monsters they had been before their deaths.  Good luck making it in this new world in a future they don‚Äôt understand with a tarnished reputation having been dead for years.

I had small gripes like all the villains just deciding to fuck off for seemingly no real reason when Goblin returned at the condo, MJ and Peter‚Äôs relationship just being reset (for now. I think there is a chance that‚Äôs reversed in Multiverse of Madness), and Tobey and Andrew‚Äôs only adventures that were referenced being what we saw in their movies as if nothing of note occurred after. However, the good FAR FAR FAR FAR FAAAAAR out weighed the bad and while I respect anyone who the movie just didn‚Äôt work for having an opinion, I feel like the ‚Äúit‚Äôs ONLY fan service‚Äù crowd didn‚Äôt understand the movie. If you strip away the nostalgia of the movie and look at what happened solely in a bubble as if it were the first time those characters were seen it was still a great movie plot. This is the most perfect Peter Parker/Spider-man portrayal that has ever existed in live action. Everything all the past movies have missed was nailed in this movie perfectly.

And both the post credit scene and the Doctor Strange trailer were brilliantly done and have me so incredibly hyped for the future of everything.

Also, the theories that went into some of the stuff (Strange acting weird, The Sanctum being snowy, The black Mystic suit) only for those things to have the most simple explanations made them all WAY better.

The movie needed another 10 minutes, where some more time would be dedicated in the how the spider gang finds cures and also some more chatting between them. Finally, in the final battle it would be interesting to see Tobey fight Andrew's guys and vice versa a bit.


The villain motivations were kinda all over the place, and especially sandman, I just don't get what he wants in the end, does he want to back or does he want to be cured? Lizard too just bring there.

I think I witnessed over a dozen different emotions while watching this movie as it was simply just that damn good. I stood until the ending way after the credits were rolled and the first little teaser was shown as there was actually two post movie teasers. 
The ending of course was bittersweet and had me feeling all sorts of emotions. When Andrews Spiderman saved MJ and I saw the pain in his eyes because that‚Äôs how Gwen should have been saved (not his fault) and I feel he definitely got some closure and in his mind redemption by saving Toms MJ. When he was in the coffee shop watching two people who were once his bestest friends and seeing his girlfriend knowing who she is but her now oblivious was also a tear jerker.
I took the ending up as he didn‚Äôt try to jog her memory nor Ned‚Äôs memory because he wanted them to have a positive quality of life. Being Spider-Man‚Äôs friends puts them at risk. He knows that just associating with him could have and actually almost came close to them losing their lives. He wanted them to go off to MIT and to just live the most fulfilling, happy lives and not have to deal with all of the chaos, danger, stress and risks that are a byproduct of knowing him.

hp3pyo2,"I enjoyed the movie thoroughly: great up until the denouement.

I'm confused about whether the spell was just supposed to erase ""Peter Parker is Spider-Man"" or Peter's whole existence.  The Daily Bugle bit established that Spider-Man has done hero-level things (TBD how previous films become retconned), but he should still have been an enrolled student at Midtown and thus MJ and Ned know him at minimum as a fellow student.  Happy meeting May independent of Spider-Man business could have happened, but for May to have never mentioned her own nephew to him through the course of their dating doesn't seem right; and without that knowledge, does Happy believe Spider-Man had something to do with her death and is holding a grudge?  If he doesn't exist, how and where does he get enough money/credit to rent an apartment if he has no SSN, birth records, and anything that ties him to an inheritance of May's estate (or any ties to the original Parker estate that May would have been executor of)?

I have to think the next film (or a *Multiverse of Madness* cameo) addresses some of this so he can seamlessly be part of the next Avengers team-up.  Easy thing to do is have him knock on Strange's door to tell his story, or approach Happy (or Scott Lang, since he's more easy-going and trusting, assuming Peter knows/remembers his name and how to contact him) and disclose enough classified information to make his story credible enough to warrant investigation.",ri7eum

hp8gl8s,"Amazing movie (no pun intended) and a must-see for anyone who grew up watching the Spider-Man movies. I loved all the closure everyone got, and the fact that they actually made a story around them rather than them just being cameos.

I have two small issues with it--not plot holes or anything, just stuff that seemed out of character. First, Dr. Strange had really weird characterization in this movie. He was willing to go to great lengths to help with Peter's admittedly minor problems (in the grand scheme), but then he almost immediately did a heel turn and wanted to essentially execute all of the villains for a pretty flimsy reason, ethically. I was waiting the whole time for it to be revealed that he was being impersonated or controlled by a villain.

Second, I'm not super happy with Peter's decision not to approach his friends. I get that he wanted them to be safe and happy. But that didn't really change from previous scenes: he knew for most of the movie that their association with him was dangerous, and yet by the goodbye scene he seemed to accept that. Also, I feel like he should have had ethical qualms about it. Not only did he promise that he'd reconnect with them, but he's going against their informed wishes. By not telling them, he's making the decision for them instead of letting them choose. A decision that they *did* choose when they *did* know everything. If this were a TV series, I think it would be the basis for an arc where his friends eventually find out and get mad at him until he realizes he was in the wrong. But from what I can tell, it's just the MCU way of sidelining those characters, which kinda puts a stain on this iteration of Spider-Man. He's apparently the kind of guy who thinks he knows what's best for everyone, even if it's against their express wishes, and depending on how the acting contracts shake out, that may just never be addressed.

Again, though, those are small issues. Most of the movie I spent grinning and making [this gesture](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/FocusedGrandBrant-max-1mb.gif)",ri7eum

&#x200B;

first thoughts:

&#x200B;

Good:

&#x200B;

Everything with Toby and Andrew.   Really can't overstate how important it was to get this part of the film right..  I think they mostly did a great job.

&#x200B;

the emotional weight of the movie was very heavy and great.

&#x200B;

An absolutely amazing death scene for Aunt May.. everything about it.. from her dialogue, to the slow collapse, to Tom's acting and staging of the swat team around the building.

&#x200B;

William Dafoe's maskless goblin.   Amazing.

&#x200B;

Goblin getting punched in the face while smiling and laughing.. amazing.

&#x200B;

Doc Ock was great too.    The first battle with him was fantastic.    Acting was great.

&#x200B;

peter and MJ's chemistry was fantastic.   very touching.

&#x200B;

Fantastic story arc for Tom Holland's spiderman..  we really have seen Tom grow up as spiderman over these last few years.    The ending with him being erased in everyone's memory was a genius move that should lead to great places in future films.    Get's peter out of the shadow of Tony stark, the avengers a bit..

&#x200B;

Things that didn't work for me:

&#x200B;

The villain's from Andrew's movies are not good and anytime they were on the screen I was wishing they weren't there (sandman too) and we could focus on the two iconic villains from the first two toby movies.     Hopefully this is the last time we get a marvel film overstuffed with villains (didn't they learn their lesson from Spiderman 3?)

CGI on The Lizard was rough too.   I can handle the CGI in the fights.. but the closeups of him talking (in the jail or wherever)..  he looks bad.    Why they designed his face to look like that I have no idea.    not a fan of the more human looking face on The Lizard from the movies.   The comic book character design was way better IMO.   Give him a snout and big jaw..

Sandman is CGI sand for almost the entire movie.   We only see the actor's more defined face once at the end.    Not a fan.

Jamie Fox was the only villain (besides Goblin and doc ock) that seemed to have any interest in being a real character that the audience cares about.    Sadly he has to compete with sandman and the lizard for screen time and even his story doesn't add up to much.   I don't think his design is well done either.

My dislike for Dr. Strange grew a lot in this movie.  While his character is interesting and has been put to good use before (Thor 3 comes to mind)..  it bugs me how easily his powers can be called into play so conveniently whenever the writers want..   when they want him to be he is this powerhouse who can literally change the universe, open up portals to other dimensions, etc etc.   and then because he is so powerful they have to invent reasons he isn't there helping...  or if he is around somehow he doesn't do half the shit that he would in other scenes/movies.

&#x200B;

Note to marvel.. we don't need Dr. Strange for the multiverse.    We got Loki and all those timelines that have opened up now from his series.    You didn't need this contrived 'spell went bad cause Tom wanted some folks to remember him' plot device.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Overall:   Really great movie that I am excited to see again.",ri7eum
hpj8gdy,"Peter should have just let Strange finish the original spell and then he could just unmasked to the people he wanted to and that would have been that.  I mean, as far as the heroes go, they would still have known him as spider-man and all the things they did together.

Instead, he had to fuck everything up which just leads to everyone forgetting he exists? I'm still trying to understand how that works. Like would he still have records at his highschool that he was a student but no one can remember ever seeing him before?  It seemed like a unnecessary path to go. The ""One More Day"" comic book story line didn't do a lot of things right.  But at least it didn't do something like this.

I'm very confused as to why so many people in new york were siding with Mysterio.  I don't remember the second movie much anymore, but did mysterio ever operate in america?  If not, why were there so many new yorkers die hard at defending and supporting a guy they've never met or seen over spider-man who fucking saved the world fighting against Thanos.  It makes no sense. 

Those things aside, I loved the movie.  I love making peter a client of matt murdoc which also happened in the comics.  I loved the other spider-men showing up. 

It was interesting watching the story that puts Peter on the road that all the other peters had to face to fully realize their spider-man path. Except for losing aunt may instead of uncle ben. Even down to him making his costume look more like the other guys.  

And I know people love peter being a broke depressed loser.  But I still say The Superior Spider-man story line was always the way I wanted Peter to go.  Being able to achieve a better balance between his life and and being spider-man.  So not using that as an excuse to not succeed personally.

hq41ilw,"Just saw the movie today, and I had a couple of thoughts that maybe somebody could shed some light on:

1. How are any of the other movies' dead villains able to be pulled into the MCU world, anyway? It was confirmed that the flow of time had happened as normal, because Tobey had clearly aged (as Doc Ock had pointed out), and Sandman had said that the deaths of Green Goblin and Doc Ock were all over the news when they happened. Did the spell that pulled them in somehow reach back in time, too? Doctor Strange even had a whole thing about how even if he wanted to turn back time, he couldn't anymore, because he no longer had the Time Stone. Maybe I missed a line of dialogue, or something (I did miss the line in There Will Be Carnage when Venom was talking about hive knowledge across universes, hence how he was able to be pulled in even though the Venom universe doesn't have a Spider-Man).

2. If the spell was able to reach back in time to pull dead people through just by virtue of knowing Spider-Man's identity, then why not go full traumatization and pull Gwen in? She obviously knew that Peter was Spider-Man, so that would have been a hell of a thing to have seen.

3. How did the spell at the end allow a piece of the Venom symbiote to stay behind? I'm assuming that was just for the sake of moving the story forward.

Overall, I absolutely loved the movie. I've really hated how the MCU essentially turned Spider-Man into some kind of Iron Boy sidekick character, so it was really cool to see all of it come to a head and have a One More Day situation put him right where he should have been from the get-go. It was also really cool to see the Matt Murdock cameo, even though I haven't watched any Daredevil. His ""I'm a really good lawyer"" line killed me.",ri7eum

So essentially the villains are pulled out right before they die except the ones who didn‚Äôt die they‚Äôre pulled right before they‚Äôre defeated right? 

So wouldn‚Äôt curing all the villains create a paradox/‚Äúbutterfly‚Äù effect situation?

For example- Norman.
He gets cured and sent back to right before Tobey kills him. So now Tobey doesn‚Äôt kill him. 
But if Tobey doesn‚Äôt kill him that effects the next 2 movies very significantly.

A.  We don‚Äôt have Harry see Spider-Man laying down his dead father.

B.  We don‚Äôt have Harry telling Doc Ock that Peter knows Spider-Man 

C. We don‚Äôt have Harry become hob-goblin. Which would mean not only does Harry not die at the end of the third movie but Tobey now has no help defeating sandman and venom‚Ä¶would he have won this battle without Harry?

hrdcjzw,"Just saw it last night and I‚Äôm still reeling, some questions I had 

1. The problem in the movie was, strange casting the spell to make people forget Peter Parker is Spider-Man, but it got messed up due to Peters interference right? Why does that lead to a rip in the multiverse? Because the reverse is everyone who knows Peter Parker is Spider-Man?

hoym4g0,"The movie was okay.  I mean, don't get me wrong, it was technically great and the production was good, but man.  We need better writers.  This is like the fourth or fifth movie I've seen where I'm just shaking my head asking who the hell writes these movies.

Spiderman 2 is still the best spiderman movie and Homecoming is the best Tom Holland movie.  This movie is good, and a pretty great theater movie but that's it.  It's way too interested in cracking mediocre jokes and the pacing is way too quick to let quiet moments simmer.  Piling in fan service isn't going to make a movie great.

Here's some thoughts on specific things:

- I like what they did with Andrew's character.  We actually got to develop him in this movie and it felt like his presence was warranted.  Tobey was in this because Disney knew people wanted to see him.  You can tell he's had a lot of time to refine his acting.  Just wish they did more with the character.

- The villains all range from great to wtf.  William Dafoe as Green Goblin is fantastic.  Alfred Molina is good.  Jamie Fox is Jamie Fox.  I think of all the villains, they did the best with Green Goblin.  He felt terrifying when he was going crazy and Dafoe actually felt like a victim to some extent too.  Doc Ock didn't feel like an improvement over his previous incarnation, and in some ways less interesting.  I do wish we got to see him fight more on the Hero's side.  I still don't understand Electro's justification or goals, and why he just changed his mind so quickly about losing his powers and going home.  Would have been even more thematic imo if losing his powers was killing him, that would have been so interesting and made a lot of sense as well as provide a clear motivation and a huge conflict.  Nah, what we get is goblin says some stuff and now ""electro bad"" again even though he KNOWS Peter will send them back if things go south.  Also, could Doc Ock just please shut up about the power of the sun in his hands?  He said that once in the Raimi movie, it's not like that's the only thing he knows how to say.

- Sandman was handled like shit in this movie.  His whole motivation is he wants to go back home, so instead of helping the spidermen who WANT TO SEND HIM HOME he teams up with the villains WHO DON'T WANT TO GO HOME.  WTF writers.  The only justification he gives is he doesn't trust anyone, but he seems to trust Electro and Lizard when they're even less trustworthy than Spiderman should be.

- I fucking hate the box that can fix anything.  That has to be the single laziest writing tool I've ever seen in a movie.  It also goes to highlight a big problem I've had with this trilogy is that it seems like whenever Peter has a problem, things work out for him too easily.  Apprehended by Doc Ock?  Don't worry, nanotechnology!  Want to cure the villains?  There's a box in the closet that can do that!  Want to be with MJ?  Easy because she's already in your arms and doesn't care that you're Spiderman.  Aunt May discovering your identity?  Who cares!  She's your PR person.  And not to mention all the Iron Boy nonsense.  Glad it seems they're going away with all that in the future but please make it permanent.  All in all, box that fixes anything is stupid and whoever came up with that should feel stupid.

- Aunt May dying wasn't very emotional.  It's just such a weird time in Tom Holland's character arc for this to happen.  This may just be me, but she didn't have the screen presence that the original Uncle Ben had and she's barely been a character in the entire trilogy.  Her one character trait is that she dated Happy.  I guess the other character trait is that she's hot.  Also, the forced Great Power speech was ridiculous.  Would have been great to do it at the Feast place with Dafoe in the back because Peter mentions he doesn't want to help them, but Aunt May could use this time to tell him he has a great power and needs to use it responsibly.  But moreover, we've seen this so many times now that it's just lost its effectiveness.  Finally, Peter has already used his powers responsibly the whole time.  He already fought fucking Thanos and took down Vulture on his own.  It's just such a bad time in his character arc to bring this up.

- Lots of other bad dialogue.  Toby mentions that he's been thinking of a serum to cure Goblin.  Why?  Goblin was dead for twenty years.  You also don't know what the Goblin Serum is even made of.  Also also, Tobey was never shown to be much of a scientist.  Sure, he's smart, but he's never invented anything.  Lots of dumb dialogue like this in the movie.

- Something that was completely missed was the chance to have a truly emotional scene and do something with the other Peter Parkers.  The villains came back to life even though they died in the past.  You know what would have been great?  If Gwen came back to life and Harry came back to life.  The Peters could have one last conversation with them and that would have been really touching.  It also makes sense plot wise too because of what Strange said.  It just makes no sense that only villains and Spidermen came to this universe but all the other characters who knew stayed home even though Strange specifically says anyone who knew who Spiderman was came through.

- This iteration of J Jonah Jameson is just annoying and I hate how he just seems flat out psychopathic in this universe.  He doesn't have any of the Raimi charm or humanity.

- Almost forgot this, but Ned being able to do magic is also something I highly detest about the way modern cinema treats its protagonists.  He just knows how to do it.  Don't ask why, don't think about the fact that it took Strange years of practice and learning.  No, some random kid from Queens can just conjure portals.  WTF writers.

I know it may seem like I'm being overly harsh on this movie but I did enjoy it for what it was, an average superhero movie with above average fan service but nothing special.  Spiderman 2 is still the best movie that tackles what it means to be Spiderman and Into the Spiderverse is still a better multiverse movie.  This one felt like a MCU movie that only exists because Disney is disgustingly wealthy instead of a movie that feels like everything justifies their existence.  Overall a 6.5/10 for me.",ri7eum
hp3lywo,"The trailers hyped the film well, but the film didn't meet the hype of the film. The characters, especially the villains, were flat. The dialogue was underwhelming. The actors came across like they were playing themselves IRL but dressed in the costumes of their characters. The two Peters were added simply for nostalgia and added nothing to the plot; and the plot was cringe at best. For, the entire premise revolves around Peter being disappointed about he and his friends not getting into an illustrious college, so he asks help of a wizard to cast a spell to make things right. The spell goes wrong because Peter is wishy-washy, and therefore, B grade silliness ensues. This was not a good film at all. Kept looking at the time wondering how much time was left.

hoy34at,Why does Andrew Garfield apologize for being a white Spiderman?,ri7eum
hoypdl9,"Didn't love the ""let's cure the villains"" thing. Disney just cannot let bad people be bad can they? Everything needs to be happy and kid friendly and ugh. There have been 4 Marvel movies this year. Only one hasn't ended with the villain being somewhat redeemed by the end. It's getting stale.    

Wish they'd spent less time trying to incorporate every single meme ever seen on the internet and more time just telling a story.  
  
Should've cut Lizard and Sandman. They both served zero purpose other than the writers working backwards from ""We want a three way battle at the end before Norman turns up"". Cutting them and having a tighter story would've been much better.  
  
They also absolutely wasted J.K. Simmons. In the Raimi films what made him so great was his bouncing off everyone else at the Bugle. Here they literally just have him surrounded by a greenscreen ranting at nothing. I was so excited to see him back but by the end I just wanted it to stop. Which is never something one should think about J.K. Simmons.  

I think this film has a lot of good stuff going for it. I think Holland, Zendaya, Molina, Foxx and Garfield are all great with Dafoe the undisputed MVP. But I think they tried to do way too much and never quite got it off the ground enough. It's not bad. It's fine. The problem is these days a movie either has to be the greatest thing ever, or the worst thing ever. But this isn't either of those. It's just a perfectly fine, enjoyable Spider-Man movie that probably could've been a lot better.",ri7eum
hoza3zm,"It's just another formulaic Disney/Marvel movie. Lizard could've just been replaced by Venom and the movie would've have been better or just get rid of lizard. The ""I'm something of a scientist myself"" was super cringy. Aunt Mae wasn't a character so her death had no impact other than the story saying it does. Sandman's motivation doesn't make any sense, electro literally says ""sorry sandman no one is going home"" which should've made him switch  sides and also ruined his character arc from the third movie. The Andrew Garfield helping Toby with his back was pointless and could've been cut. The movie didn't take any risks which is every Marvel movie ever

I liked what they did with doc oc's character and with green goblin, Jaimie fox was amazing as electro and it was nice to see Toby Maguire as Spiderman again so it's a 5/10.",ri7eum

Here‚Äôs a Story for you:

Peter and his family are on the run and go into hiding. JJJ, is so bent on getting rid of Spider-Man and putting him jail that he goes to see the Villains in Prison and posts bail for Mac Gargon. 

Mac Gargon agrees to hunt down the Spider-Man but needs equipment. Que J Jonah buying the latest military suit tech and turning Mac into Scorpion. 
Scorpion‚Äôs armour could be a nanotech style with a tail mechanical tail controlled by him (Mac). 

While Peter MJ and Ned come to terms with how their life has been affected Peter finds himself having to save them more and more.

When the alternate Spidermans were introduced, BOY was I surprised, Seeing Tobey Maguire had me cheering.

I will say seeing the og villains cured was certainly interesting though in spiderman 1 and 2, they made it clear what the villains ultimate fate was.

Brilliant all around. Just such a joy and an incredible, personal Spider-Man story.

- Amazing writing that respected all characters and gave them depth, closure, and bringing home the goddamn Biblical fucking more important than the bible message that what Spider-man stands for no matter what is that with great power comes great responsibility. 

- Good jokes

- We're getting symbiote spidey next trilogy babyyyy

- They actually took the time to do things well and you can see it. For example, the shot where Tom Holland picks up the glider to kill Norm, that shot actually made Tom look TERRIFYING, they experimented and found the perfect make-up, lighting, and angle, to make baby face Tom look SCARY A F. 

Cons

- Spell plot was a bit contrived and ill explained. I thought at the end he would ask strange to send him through the tear and have all the villains chase him into another universe and the next movie he would have to make his way home from being trapped in multiverse. I know thats just what I was thinking but it was still a bit wishy washy. 

- No miles morales or any into the spiderverse in post and postpost credit scenes :(",ri7eum
howx224,"Most of the movie is great but the ending is shit. It undoes all previous character drama (by having everyone forget it) - and it doesn't make sense on many levels.

 If everyone forgot peter: does he have a valid ID to by an apartment and work? How do people remember infinity war, do they have alternate memories or just blurry ones? Did the events before happen? Why did he have to erase everyone's memories of him? (they say it's to reverse the original spell- but it makes more sense to make everyone forget peter parker is spiderman - as that's the original trigger) 

I liked Spiderman 1 and 2 for their character drama and interactions. I feel cheated by it all being erased. Every character interaction he's had has been erased. It's similar to the '√≠t was a dream all along' trope.

What if when Peter walked back into the restaurant to meet with MJ he's at the counter with his note in hand.

Peter then continues to just stand there in disbelief so he just orders his coffee and walks out leaving the note on the counter on accident. Mj then later reads it and kind of starts to remember but is still confused/shocked so she doesn't  tell Ned. The right at the end of the movie Ned is in the living room with his mom and Dr.Strange appears through a portal and tells Ned to follow him(since it was revealed that Ned has ""magic"" powers to open portals. That's how the movie ENDS. So that in the next spiderman movie MJ locates Peter and it clicks and she suddenly remembers everything Peter and her went through and falls in love with him again. But now Peter has to fight his ex best friend Ned (who has been training his magic powers under Dr. Strange) even though Peter doesn't want to but Ned is upset that he stole MJ from him.

* Does Strange remember talking to Ned and MJ in the Sanctum but not a third person?

* How exactly does Happy remember things like the European trip?

* Doesn't MJ have photos of them on her phone or something?

* Things like EDITH and other Stark tech that had Peter's bioprint, have they lost that data?

Also it's killed the Vulture storyline. If Vulture was gonna be in the next movie it would be 3 movies late anyway, but now he's lost the none thing that made this continuation interesting - he knew Peter was Spider-Man.",ri7eum
howsmc6,"I enjoyed most of the movie but there was one specific part that pissed me off so much that it actually brings the entire thing down to me. Which is a shame because I enjoyed everything else but when Peter once again decides the fate of his friends without their input just broke my enjoyment for Tom Holland's Peter. Like...Peter starts this movie by making a rash decision that will affect his friends without actually telling him. He gets slightly chewed out by MJ who tells him to let them know...yet at the end he again makes a rash decision that will affect his friends and doesn't tell them until it is too late for them to do anything...and then decides that he knows what's best for his friends and doesn't even try to get them to remember. 

And like, I actually DO like that now Peter is now more of a classical Spider-Man but also...I just hate how he doesn't really...learn that lesson. And like, that amount of ""I know best"" is very very controlling and just....god I don't know I enjoyed everything else. I enjoyed the crossover. I enjoyed the fact that they don't treat the crossover with irrelevance. I'm glad they actively fight back against the ""it's a crossover they're disposable"" nature of these things and acknowledge that these people are victims that need help. I enjoyed the banter amongst everyone. I enjoyed the chemistry. But like that last few minutes just...brings it all down for me. I guess I also don't like the regression of Ned's and MJ's character. Like Ned learned he has a gift for magic! That would have been facisnating...and poof memory gone. Like, if the next movie allows Ned and MJ to tell Peter that he was wrong to not include them in Peter's actions when Ned and MJ are going to be affected by them then maybe I'll forgive this but it really drags the movie down for me.",ri7eum

Firstly, who will they get to play Venom in the MCU, of course.  


Secondly, they were in San Francisco (where the Tom Hardy Venom movies are located), so will Venom and Shang Chi cross paths?  


Will Venom be anti-hero in the MCU or outright villain?

I guess a lot of the fans welcome the return to the basics, but that ending felt too harsh on Peter, almost sadistic. I know the movie had to happen but a lot of the film's problem would've been solved if the characters didn't immediately jump to action and think for more than a second like real people. Strange should've explained the rules more thoroughly, Peter shouldn't have been so cocky about his capabilities, and Aunt May shouldn't have bitten off more than she can chew and try to help VILLAINS from DIFFERENT UNIVERSES and chide his nephew into helping them as well, which ultimately costs her life and ruin her nephew's life, not to mention the untold damages and casualties to the civilians. She was grossly irresponsible and it felt like the movie was trying to divert the audience away from that problem with the ""With great power comes great responsibility"" moment. Peter was also responsible as well, but not a lot of other MCU heroes had to make up for their mistakes with this much loss, which someone could argue is a fate worse than death. And ultimately he is still a kid! This movie somehow made Andrew Garfield spiderman's situation at the end of his movie enviable. I guess maybe a future spiderman movie could address this problem and make Peter's fate less miserable, but until then I don't think I will be revisiting the movie.

And if so, considering that last scene shows Peter in his new suit swinging through New York in the snow, how cool would it be if we see him the background somewhere during the Hawkeye season finale? 

I love the theory that NWH, Loki, Wanda and Hawkeye are all taking place simultaneously, giving different looks into concurrent events that involve the splitting of the multiverse. Hopefully by the Dr Strange sequel we'll really see how all these separate events have led to the Multiverse splitting and we'll find out where that's going to take the MCU as a whole.

I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say to that I was left feeling incomplete.

1. I kinda wish there would a little more action in the movie, I feel like there were a lot more talking than fighting which isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing because it established to plot, makes the characters feel real and all that. I‚Äôm just a sucker for the mcu action.

2. It annoyed me how stupid Tom can be at times, like I know he‚Äôs a kid but it kinda doesn‚Äôt make sense how he kept interrupting the dr. Strange spell when he was repeatedly told to stop. But at the same time I guess that‚Äôs kind of the theme of this story, that Peter caused this and with great power comes great responsibility. Still it leaves a bad feeling in me knowing this was all so avoidable and that the movie has happens because Toms foolish nature.

3. If I could make an analogy of this movie it would be like saying this movie is like endgame and far from home is like infinity war.

May will be healthy again, Peter will have his secret identity back, but he will lose his marriage to MJ. The story was REVILED, but the era that spun out of it, ""Brand New Day,"" produced many fun Spider-Man stories. This movie took pieces of that god-awful storyline and actually made it good.

i955s0o,"This right here is the only disappointment I had with the film. Spider-Tobey and Spider-Andrew come from a later time in their respective universes, with SA even detailing things we didn't see in his films. But the villains all came from right before they were defeated. So Otto sees Peter here, as a man in his 30s-40s, whereas the last time he saw him, he was in his late teens or early twenties. To me, it would have made more sense had the villains come from universes where their plans succeeded. The same universe, just a different timeline. I mean, it's clear they all come from different timelines in their shared universes anyways, what with Electro's new body and Sandman addressing Spider-Tom as if they were allies. Just would have been a better reason to ""help"" the villains. Especially with the ramifications of them being cured may be them losing anyways.",ri7eum
ia9920a,I fucking BAWLED,ri7eum
hp94h20,"I discussed this in another thread, so I'll quote my opinion from that:

I think what it was doing was overwriting the spell that would make everyone forget that Peter Parker was Spider-Man. Strange said he couldn't change that, but Peter told him to make a new one that would break down the premise of the first spell, rendering it inert and repairing the damage. It only affected other universes in that it undid the tears that caused them to slip through, although it's implied that the ones who did come through were changed by the experience.

In short, the spell is local, and Strange did specify that the first one applied to ""the entire world,"" which would seem to imply that the rest of the universe would be unaffected. I also questioned this when the visual for the second spell seemed to be spreading in a circle around the world, not in a sphere through the universe. I doubt Strange has the ability to do that anyway, seeing as he couldn't hold back the villains from entering his universe. And performing a memory spell across the multiverse is way beyond his pay grade at this point.

I'll also add that the people coming through don't need their memories wiped, as they weren't specifically coming for Peter.  Remember that some of the ones that came through helped him, and some of them never even interacted with them.  They were only brought through because they knew Peter was Spider-Man, and it just so happened that most of them were in New York and it was in their characters to want to kill Spider-Man, whose face was all over the news, making him relatively easy to find.  The memory spell was to repair the dimension, not to convince the villains to go away.",ri7eum
how8wvp,"I think the spell is interdimensional, as it makes the people coming through forget who spiderman was as well",ri7eum
hpdtt5h,"Think they did this in a good way.  No one know who ‚ÄúPeter Parker‚Äù is.  They all know about Spider-Man and he regains his secret identity.

Happy when meeting Peter at the end asks how does he knew Aunt May and Happy says Spider-Man.  Goes to show he finally has his secret identity back and can hide it better now that he‚Äôs an adult.",ri7eum
hpd14p3,"Well the spell *looked* like it only went across Earth...

...but at least in the German dub, I'm pretty sure Strange says that *everyone* forgets. So eh, 50/50 chance.",ri7eum
hoy6ooa,"Yea everyone in the Universe has forgotten, a bitter sweet ending.",ri7eum
hpddo9m,My question is if the spell just made people forget who he is and didn't change the timeline then what about all the video evidence and stuff that was filmed showing him as Spiderman? Wouldn't that be changing the timeline?,ri7eum
hp90qht,[deleted],ri7eum
hpklesc,"Everyone in the universe. They still remember spiderman, just no clue who is it.

So now all the Avengers know spiderman and worked with him for years but suddenly no one knows who's under the mask. It's odd.",ri7eum
hp6tex4,">Tom finally having his origin story come full circle

One of the things people say smack about Tom's Spider-Man is that he's bassically Iron Man Jr. with access to all the Stark tech and basically a blank check for resources, which goes totally against the core of the classic Spider-Man which is a kid that learns to be resourceful, is always scrapping for money and manages to stay noble even if the whole world seems to be against him.

Tom's Spider-Man now has lost his friends, his family and the almost limitless resources, and did it willingly for the greater good even if it meant being alone and hustling like an everyday person. This somehow worked magically by bringing Peter Parker/Spider-Man back to square one, but now with a ton of accumulated experience from his past.

Now I'm looking forward for more of this Spider-Man",ri7eum
hp595j2,That‚Äôs what I loved about the movie. Andrew and Tobey getting the closure and redemption you didn‚Äôt know they needed until they got it. From Andrew saving MJ to Tobey stopping Tom. It was intense. I wasn‚Äôt ready for it.,ri7eum
hp411c9,I heard the same quote and it's awesome they didn't put it in so we could say it ourselves.,ri7eum
hpkmw3v,"They tied all past movies and their character and motives so well in this one. Like how they all went through the same stuff as Peter 1. 

I didn't quite like how they simply cured everyone in like a blink of an eye tho.. I mean tony has been dead for a while but his tech is somehow always advancing. Years of research for Conors, goblin, sandman to end up like that and then he goes like ""we got a fabricator"" like it's just another 3D printer let's fix them.

I get that once tony ""unlocked"" nanotech tree things will get weird but that's basically magic now. A small glob of Spidey suit literally just took over the tentacles like it was a Bluetooth earphones and made an interface for it instantly with just the onboard AI, absolutely nuts why can't spidey just control every machine and computer around him.

It's nice they reset him because the tech was getting a bit too OP imo.",ri7eum
hpvaz5y,"I gotta say I was a initially a little put off by the absence of Uncle Ben, but the emotional payoff of him losing Aunt May was much more impactful than in the previous iterations, just because we actually got to know Aunt May and see how deep her relationship with Peter was. Uncle Ben, on the other hand, always ended up dying before we, the audience, got to know him.",ri7eum
hq0t5g0,To add to that... The fact that he made his own beautiful shiny red-and-blue spidey suit while drinking the coffee MJ made for him was layers upon layers of meaning in one scene.,ri7eum
hpmgw5o,"I had the exact same thought. ""He understands now that he makes the suit, not the other way around"" and the same Ironman quote.",ri7eum
hpctbl8,"My question is‚Ä¶ IF the villains that showed up after the spell was interrupted was explained because it was right when they died. Does that mean the Spider-Men also showed up from the day ‚Äúthey‚Äù died!? 

This is heavy Doc!",ri7eum
hphvfue,"Neither Andrew or Tobey needed a closure. Both of them already became a better version of themselves at the end of their movies. Anyway Marvel is so much short on ideas that ended up making Tom Holland's spiderman the same as Raimi's. And for doing that, recall the previous Spidermans just to give some kind of development or character to Tom Holland's, and kill aunt may. Raimi's Spiderman was so great that still in 2021 keeps influencing all the others.

And please, stop making every movie a damn comedy. I don't need a joke every 0.2 second, nobody really does",ri7eum
hpd6mu8,">letting us know he‚Äôs made it with MJ

Man, that's the part that fucking got me for some reason. At the end of the day Tobey is MY Spider-man, as in, I truly love all three, but he's the Spider-man of my childhood.

And the thing is, now that I'm an adult, seeing him come back and saying things like ""complicated, but we made it work"" referring to such an iconic couple, and ""trying to be better"", it really spoke to me. Like, yeah, life's rough, even outside being a superhero, but you find a way. It's so validating for those of us who grew up with his trilogy and are now trying to figure shit out in life.

Really loved Tobey in this movie.",ri7eum

hp9yawm,"My theater clapped and cheered for Andrew saving MJ as well.

However when I saw NWH, it was next level. As soon as Ned opened the portal and you first got a glimpse of Andrew, people started quietly mermoring with excitement which grew into a full on explosion of cheers when he popped through the portal, same with Tobey as well, although after the Tobey cheers died down one lone guy just let out a ""ARGHHHHH"" of joy, it was hilarious.

However the one that got me the most was when MJ fell and Tom gets nabbed by Goblin as he was trying to catch her. The crowd lost their shit as soon as it happened because everyone knew it was going to be Andrew that saved her. It was pretty cool and I usually hate cheering and clapping during a movie.",ri7eum
hp7l7zz,"Yeah, Londoner here and the exact the same thing happened in the cinema I went to.

I was so surprised, and then they cheered again when Tobey Maguire showed up, someone shouted ""He's the certiest Spider-Man"" and everyone laughed rather than the usual shushing.

I've been so out of the loop for this movie, because I knew I wouldn't be seeing it until after Christmas so I watched and read as little as possible, even earlier. I knew there was going to be villains from other universes, but thought that was going to be it. Been so busy with other stuff that I never really thought a lot about the movie.

That way you evade spoiler-heavy trailers, casting decisions, and the lack of ""hype"" also keep expectations low to reasonable.

Case in point; I didn't watch a single trailer for this, nor did I follow any news. Going into the movie completely blind like that, as a rather big Spidey fan, was friggin amazing!

He sees that she's happy in her life without him & decides to let her go just so she can be happy. The ultimate sacrifice so the girl he loves can remain happy. So few words & yet every emotion was conveyed perfectly by Tom. He outdid himself.,ri7eum

And then your anxiety kicks in and you know that this is your actual first impression for them and trying to explain what happened and that you both were together and everything else would just straight up make you look like a crazy person to them and blow any sort of chance you could have in the future.

It would be the equivalent of going up to a girl you never met before at all and saying ""hey you lost your memory but we were going out and we loved each other"". Yeah you cant just do that lol. Great way to get them to never talk to you again and possibly get a restraining order.",ri7eum

Being all made by basically the same people does that and it shows how great it is when everything has a reason and makes sense.

One offs with 0 plans or foundations for future movie sucks big time when they decide last minute ""let's make another"" MCU feels very planned with a lot of room to grow and that what makes it so great.

Sony and many other studios really just make movies based off metrics on how well they did and it totally shoes.. MCU reached a point where they can put what crap and people will still love it because it's basically a long running show with long episodes and each adds to the story as a whole. Feels like MCU team gets much more freedom and it's not all just numbers or we wouldn't see a lot of movies get a 2 and 3.",ri7eum

hp9ljgs,"He's the oldest actor of the bunch and least likely to re-appear again as Spidey in films moving forward. He probably can't do much stunt work himself. But there is a lot of love and nostalgia for him.

I thought they were killing him off to send a message to the Holland Peter about how Peter should be willing to risk his life to save another, even a villain. And that might have opened the door for Miles Morales in the Raimi universe.",ri7eum

Glad I was not the only one who had that thought process!",ri7eum

hovqj67,I would have liked if Venom joined the fight with the Spidermen. Would be a bit too much but having every possible Spiderman character involved would have been cool.,ri7eum
hp12g2p,I think my issue is that isn't vulture teased in the morbius trailer? And morbius references venom twice in the trailer so wouldn't that mean they are in the mcu?,ri7eum
hp416av,Am I the only one that doesn‚Äôt understand why venom made it to the universe? I thought it was only people who knew Peter Parker. I don‚Äôt remember Spider-Man in the venom movies,ri7eum
hphzejx,"I think it's a set up for the next Spidey movie. Think about it, now they've reset Spider-Man to be alone, poor, no Avengers, no Stark Tech, no guy in the chair or understanding girlfriend. He's going to get a job at the Daily Bugle taking pictures of Spidey and who else is going to work there? This worlds version of Eddie Brock. The bit of Symbiote that got left behind will go looking for Spider-Man in NYC because Venom and Eddie just said they were going to go talk to this Spider-Man guy. So Venom will find Peter and we'll finally get the real origins to Venom in the MCU. Maybe they'll even have Tom Hardy as the MCU version of Eddie. Some characters look the same between universes. Look at JJJ for example. Maybe we'll get Gwen Stacey too.",ri7eum
hoxl9bi,"I know what you mean but it wasn‚Äôt simply for the gag. He left behind a part of the symbiote which will pay off later. The venom is now in the MCU and will need a host.

Also though, I don‚Äôt understand why Strange‚Äôs spell sent everyone back but not a piece of the symbiote. If I chopped off a finger would my body get sent back and not the finger?",ri7eum
hp3tajt,It was such a weird choice. If you wanted to get venom goo into the MCU it literally could've just fallen from space.,ri7eum
hpfq3f5,"I think Tom Holland Spiderman struggles without all the Stark tech and bonds with the leftover symbiote bond as a way to ""get his power back"", which obviously goes poorly.  He will also meet Eddie Brock and Gwen Stacy (new love interest) at college, maybe even Harry Osborn (though Goblin said Oscorp doesn't exist in Hollands universe).",ri7eum
hp7o1ic,Why were they transported at all actually? Did they know Peter Parker?? Am I missing something??,ri7eum
hp2vf8p,But that drop of symbiote on the bar counter though‚Ä¶,ri7eum
hp4q3sv,"My thing is‚Ä¶ why was Tom Hardy‚Äôs Venom there in that universe in the first place? He didn‚Äôt know Peter Parker is Spider-Man, so why was he pulled into this universe?

Made no sense to me‚Ä¶",ri7eum
hp5k705,"Which also proved to me how forced that Venom 2 post-credit felt when i saw it at the theatre (as cool as the idea theoretically could have been).   
And most importantly, the whole thing makes no damn sense. Venom/Eddie have no clue who Peter Parker/Spiderman even is. Them getting dragged in the MCU by Strange's spell is complete nonsense considering how the spell works in the movie.",ri7eum
hp3lkoz,Football is life,ri7eum
hpe70br,Because that Venom isn't a villain so would be a bit strange,ri7eum
hqqu5tn,"I agree, but I think they did that because Hardys Venom isn't really someone who would fight Spiderman, so they made it to where a Venom would originate in Tom's universe",ri7eum

hoz7w0g,"I‚Äôm actually very disappointed with this. not that I had any expectations besides Venom being a class clown, but sony just deliberately messed with the fans and I hate this",ri7eum
hp38f0c,"yea, but two things don't work for Venom. 1, he never fought spider-man, so no fear of going back home to die. Second, if you cure him, you un-venom him. And that doesn't work for future Venom movies.",ri7eum
hp5nirw,"It feels like there's still more to the story. The way Eddie gets teleported seemed like a scene from another MCU movie >!Eternals post Credits!<, so it might not all be Spider-Man related",ri7eum

Let them do what they want with the characters and sit back and collect the money off the name.",ri7eum
hpighdl,"And there was the venom gunk on the bar, bringing the symbiote into the MCU",ri7eum

hoz1jb2,I need another Andrew Spider-Man Movie,ri7eum
hovt5n0,That was the coolest Spidey Sense moment ever. It's a prelude to how cruel the Goblin's outburst is going to be. It's shot so well.,ri7eum
how586z,"I thought there was a lot of great camerawork/editing at play. That scene with the Spidey sense was really uneasy and claustrophobic. The one shot/very long shot in the beginning of Peter returning to May's apartment and racing around was fun, and that split screen of he and MJ talking on their phones was neat.",ri7eum
hoy6q8x,"That was my ""Michael Keaton in the car with Tom Holland"" moment of this movie. All three of these movies have excelled greatly in swelling intensity into a single scene.",ri7eum
hox344l,It was great because I was thinking it had something to do with the lizard. But it sort of went back a film how Peter had to train his sence with Mysterio to find the danger. Also the sence trigger was so much more intense to show just how dangerous the Green goblin is,ri7eum
hozatb9,">  the tense feeling definitely was there as he was trying to find the 'villain' in a room full of villains. Amazing stuff.

I honestly thought it was going to be a reveal of a 6th villain, to complete the group.",ri7eum
hox8j7f,"Not gonna lie, NWH had the best portrayal of the spidey sense in any movie, I liked the feeling of slo mo with heightened senses of Andrew's spidey, but you could feel the uneasiness and sickness of it with Tom. Also seeing the actual spider sense halo from the comics when Peter was in the astral plane was awesome",ri7eum
hoxyrvw,That and the tracking shot in Mays apartment in the beginning were a pleasant surprise for me. The goblin fight in the apartment building was also amazing. The flat/amauterish direction of Toms first movies were some of my main criticisms of them.,ri7eum
hoxuv1o,I loved it. At first I thought maybe he was sensing the Lizard but nah his spider sense were going nuts because of the bloodlust seething from the goblin persona taking over.,ri7eum
hp8rf9j,It's cool how Norman is so evil and dangerous that he triggers a Spidey sense just by existing nearby.,ri7eum
hoxsob1,"Yes that shot was stunningly incredible. It conveyed spider sense through cinematography and sound sooooo well. It made me feel like I was feeling the same exact high level of anxiety that Peter was feeling in that moment, like *my* spider sense was going off.",ri7eum
hovs6qs,Love a good use of the Dolly zoom,ri7eum
hoxk0fu,"That scene brought back some PTSD from my anxiety and just feeling like something is wrong, it really nailed the sense of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong right now‚Äù. I actually felt very tense in theater for that scene",ri7eum
hoxmxpd,"And then for that suspense to be broken with the first speaking line for the Goblin. ""That sense of yours is truly something else."" That was hype

Edit: actually forgot that goblins actual first line was the alley scene",ri7eum
hoxe9s4,honestly for some reason i thought that the two other spideys were gonna burst through the window there to kill goblin and other villains lol,ri7eum
hox30cl,I expected him to jump out of the window because I thought lizard was going to go after Jamison,ri7eum
hoxkdwd,I actually thought this was the part Venom was going to pop in cause I for sure thought he‚Äôd have a bigger role to play after watching Venom 2. Oh well lol.,ri7eum
hoypm1i,I thought it was electro for sure. Especially when he said ‚Äúwhy are you looking at me like that‚Äù,ri7eum
hoylqc1,"Personally for me it was the one of the bridge. Just as the fight with Doc-Ock is turning and you can hear the little ""Green Goblin Special"" sound effect a good bit before the bridge, or Peter knows what's coming.",ri7eum
hp05whd,Among Us vibes,ri7eum
hp0xt2d,"I haven't seen anyone else notice this yet, but when Strange gave him his out of body experience, you could faintly see the wavy lines coming off of Peter's head, like how his spider sense was typically portrayed in comics and cartoons.",ri7eum

hoxiu7k,"it was actually a really interesting portrayal of anxiety, i thought.",ri7eum
hozmn5a,"just saw the movie for a second time and i appreciated that scene SO MUCH. I have no clue why i didnt catch it's brilliance the first time i saw the movie, but man was i tense when that scene was happening! one of the best shots/scenes in the film for sure. Also, love Andrew getting to save MJ as a redemption, and his tearing up at that moment hit hard.",ri7eum
hoyqey5,Also the cinematography after May's death of Tom just standing in the rain with the giant screen in front of him showing the scene where it all went down. I absolutely loved that scene and the atmosphere it created.,ri7eum
hp01rje,I really hope that they maintain the Dolly zoom as a way to show the Spider-sense.,ri7eum
hp2mnbn,My favorite part about this is specifically that it shows Peters growth since the mysterio event. He can no longer be fooled and he doesn‚Äôt trust what he sees over his spider sense now,ri7eum
hpf2mx9,"Watts‚Äô direction really shines when he‚Äôs building tension. The car scene with Vulture was amazing, he upped it with the ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs real and what‚Äôs a hologram‚Äù Mysterio fight in FFH, and this scene in NWG is absolutely the crown jewel. He really knocked it out of the park.",ri7eum
hp02y3z,">I loved the movie. One thing I'm not seeing talked about as much is the apartment scene with Tom and the five villains with his spidey sense going off. It was perfectly shot, the tense feeling definitely was there as he was trying to find the 'villain' in a room full of villains. Amazing stuff.

Seriously, such an amazing way of portraying how the spider sense works.",ri7eum
hpelafj,">the tense feeling definitely was there as he was trying to find the 'villain' in a room full of villains. Amazing stuff.

Not just the camera work but the set up for it! Peter hadn't seen it but electro was second guessing the device, sandman was jittery about everything, doc oc had just gotten the chip so what if it wasn't working...and of course goblin being able to fake being Osborn. So when Peter came outside it could have been anyone.",ri7eum

hp4w148,One of my fav scenes of the movie for sure. Also the scene in Far From Home when he detects the real Mysterio while in his illusion - the amount of growth that we‚Äôve seen just in his ‚Äúspider senses‚Äù is impressive and fun to watch.,ri7eum
hp558kh,"It was amazing, terrific camera work there",ri7eum
hpgxkgi,That scene to me reminded me of being on mushrooms or other psychadelics around people that weren't. Like I was on a different space time and awareness and people asking me what's wrong. So basically a flashback. Great scene.,ri7eum

hoy7c09,There were a decent amount of people in the theater laughing at that moment and I was so confused. Him getting a second chance to save her was so heartwarming and terrifying. I loved it.,ri7eum
hoynv9r,Andrew Garfield deserved so much more from his Spiderman movies. He honestly stole this movie for me and I loved every second we saw him. An absolute gem.,ri7eum
hovb55r,Dude him tearing up made me tear up and fuck green goblin I was not expecting him to kill May like I knew he was evil but ugh but then again he went after May in the original one so,ri7eum

hoxm3nm,"I had emotional whiplash. 

My heart hurt when Aunt May died. 

Was filled with catharsis built up since ASM2 after Gwen. Spider-Man Three needed that win with MJ.

My heart hurt even worse when Tobey got stabbed.

So much hype seeing them all together, though.",ri7eum
hp0fd5a,"Hands down my favorite moment in the movie.

I've always thought Garfield's parker got unfairly maligned due to the other issues with his Spidey films.  He's easily the best actor of the three and it was great to see him get a chance to work with better material, even briefly",ri7eum

hp7m0xw,"Green Goblin was so fucking badass in this movie. When Tobey is pounding his face as hard as possible, and Goblin just keeps smiling after each punch unfazed. Holy shit, I forgot just how strong GG was. Willem killed it again, I love the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm something of a scientist myself‚Äù meme he did in this. 

It‚Äôs a movie you want to see several times.",ri7eum
hovomn6,"The lab scene where he watches Tom and MJ, then to save MJ at the construction site. Man, who be cutting onions in here.",ri7eum
hp0ygtl,And fucking brutal. That whole apartment fight was just one brutal beat down. Slamming spidy into the roof then instantly body slamming him through four floors made me wince. It was awesome. Dafoe was super intimidating in this movie and i fucking loved it.,ri7eum
hoxky8z,"I've seen it twice now, and the emotional bits don't effect me as much, but that still gets to me. I only rembered now he broke Gwen's neck when he caught her.",ri7eum
hozipvs,"Glad they finally gave him a somewhat comics-accurate costume.
  
Only thing that's weird is did they ever explain the serum that May injected him with? I figured he purposely botched it so it'd have no effect, but I was also half-expecting it to turn his human skin a green hue.",ri7eum

hoz1lid,"Garfield tearing up might have been one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever watched.   


This film had heart, comedy and excitement like no other Spider movie had. Yes it used nostalgia for some of it, but giving the other characters from the previous movies closure might have been the best idea Marvel had for a while. They started doing this in Endgame obviously, but here they have taken it to the next level. Cannot wait to see this for a second time on Sunday.",ri7eum

hp31dli,I‚Äôm not an architect or and engineer. I have helped make a float in art club in high school. Putting a big wide flat object like that shield so high up into the wind is a bad idea. Too much stress on the shield will break that arm off.,ri7eum

They mention it in passing to go check out the new Statue of Liberty and I was like wtf is she talking about.

hq0uwxf,So we can see three Spider-Men swing across Cap's shield.,ri7eum
i0zl6ea,I think the weirdest part about that whole thing is‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know that Cap would‚Äôve wanted something like that done. I feel like he would have thought it was disrespectful af to what the status of liberty stands for.,ri7eum

hovnkp8,It‚Äôs just some guy,ri7eum

hoy0ppu,"I think it reflects how experienced he is. At this point, he's hit on all the things the others have done. He's met the other heroes and villains in his universe, if they exist. He's had his civil war and infinity war and endgame and sinister six.  


He's been there and done that. There's probably not much that can surprise him, so a magic portal isn't going to shock him.",ri7eum

ht8aktb,"""Hey everyone""",ri7eum
hvpwlp8,i think that he knew immediately that he has to go through and that its not dangerous shows he has experience which supports the fact that they let him be his (old) self. btw i loved that they didnt try to make him young with miserable cgi!,ri7eum

They encounter 5, fight/capture/help them but it‚Äôs like no one in the movie went like ‚Äúhey, where‚Äôs the 6th guy?‚Äù Venom was in Cancun, Mexico. Could also be once Tobey and Andrew show up, they just didn‚Äôt have a right count of how many from the multiverse had really crossed over so they just left it at that.",ri7eum

hp0469h,"Question:  did they all die when they got sent back at the end?  Seems like they should, no?",ri7eum
hoxqhf3,"Sandman's motivation was dumb. The quickest way to get back home would've been to help the Spidermans cure the villains. There's 0 reason why he would join Electro and Lizard, who also did not have a clear direction either. 

Electro wanting to stay for the arc reactor power and Goblin being the Joker were the only two that made sense for the baddies.",ri7eum
hu0o9nq,"To be honest, Sandman's motivation is kinda silly.

Just wait dude, they're gonna send you back and not as a Sand monster.",ri7eum
hoxu60t,"Sandman motivatin didnt make sense, if he wanted to go home then why did he fight to stop them from pressing it",ri7eum
hp0qbzm,"Connors just being all ""lol"" to the entire situation start to finish was amazing.",ri7eum
hpc4ken,"I like that they weren't ""just crazy"", either.",ri7eum
hpd7cv6,"Lizard just wants to turn everyone into lizards. If you were Lizard, you‚Äôd want the same thing.",ri7eum
hpzxy46,When they cured lizard man did his arm grow back? I didnt actually see but I figured that guy would make a huge fuss about being human again with no arm since he rather had been a lizard with full appendages.,ri7eum
hqfr43k,"And Doc Ock got a nice reward for helping too, seems like he got to keep the arc reactor after taking it off Electro",ri7eum
hqiq8db,Lizard beats Spock,ri7eum
hoxs5p4,"Them telling Garfield that he is amazing was, well, amazing. Definitely a nice meta moment of them acknowledging that Garfield himself feels like his films let fans down, while also being a reference to Spider-Mans moniker.",ri7eum
how9a26,We got the Spiderman meme in the lab,ri7eum
howd9k0,"I was surprised it lasted as long as it did. Each camera swap had me thinking someone was gonna come out of the shadows and attack, but it was awesome to get that much fun dialogue.",ri7eum
how4kfv,Right! I wanted more of that just casual Spider-Man talk.,ri7eum
howfikn,Our 3 Spider-Men just interacting and the villains interacting in the Wizard Dungeon were the best parts of the movie for me.,ri7eum
hoxe4cn,‚ÄúYou‚Äôre amazing.  You‚Äôre amazing.‚Äù  Loved that reference since Garfield‚Äôs movies were The Amazing Spider-Man.,ri7eum
hoy8r58,"This . Tobey‚Äôs Spider-Man went through shit and found his way out but Andrew‚Äôs Spider-Man went through so much heartbreak and darkness and just succumbed to it and him being positively reinforced by a more experienced brother like Spider-Man was too wholesome .This movie could NOT have gone any better , man .",ri7eum
hoyevtl,"Defoe was great ... You know, I am something of scientist myself ;)",ri7eum
how5i5k,Willem Dafoe is a national treasure.,ri7eum
hoxjtqx,"I loved when they were talking about what villains they've fought. It really drives home just how deep the MCU has gotten, with so many super heroes, compared to the others where Spider-man is basically the only one.

Further driven home with the first post credit scene.",ri7eum
how6vo9,"Ned: ‚ÄúHey Peter?‚Äù

(All 3 in unison) ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù",ri7eum
howbt9p,"That damn cackle!  God, I love that man.  Dafoe is a national treasure.",ri7eum
howmkcy,"It was like a tom, tobey and andrew podcast and I loved it.",ri7eum
hox5352,You want me to crack your back? I was dying,ri7eum
hoy0vlt,"Jamison had a point about leading the bad guys to a memorial and getting destroyed though lol. Has to be a better spot then that.. and why didn't the military or any people show up after Peter had the public interview? 

I loved the movie and I'm not trying to criticize because it was incredible. Just a couple thoughts I had while watching.",ri7eum
howbpws,#You're amazing! Say it!,ri7eum
hox5cl0,That Statue of Liberty scene was giving me X-Men vibes.,ri7eum
hoy8167,"i have to say, traditionally Marvel movies have had 3 acts that just aren't as awesome as the first two.  but this one, this 3rd act was the BEST.  and better than an already killing it first two acts.",ri7eum
hoxi1ac,"> loved them prepping up Garfield

And telling him he's amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è


(even though he never fought an alien) üòÅ",ri7eum
hozuzvv,For comic movie villains Dafoe is right there with Ledger.,ri7eum
hp08h5o,">Also, put Dafoe on the list on iconic comic characters

When did he get removed?",ri7eum
hox38h2,That scene could of gone on for an hour longer and it would be too short for me still,ri7eum
hozk9ip,I couldn't help but think how tired Lizard would've been from swimming all the way to Ellis Island and then having to climb all that scaffolding to even be part of the fight lol,ri7eum
hoznf3i,"Willem Dafoe is just such an amazing actor. He won't get one for it, but he put forth an Oscar worthy performance. You could just see it in his face when Green Goblin took control.",ri7eum
hoxjevz,Out am I?,ri7eum
hoywbki,Spiders-Man,ri7eum
hoz9yie,I could have watched the 3 Spideys talk for 2 bloody hours. I adored that part.,ri7eum
hp3h66l,The Spidermen should do a podcast together discussing the shit they've seen and their powers in each universe.,ri7eum
hp58b90,I wondered how much of the exchange was ad-libbed but the leaked clip of Andrew seems it was only him and Tobey conversing.,ri7eum
hox38gr,"Nah, you're amazing.. amazing.. (Amazing Spiderman).. it was also a joke.",ri7eum
hp3izym,"""You're Amazing. You're Amazing.""  
Loved that lol",ri7eum
hp66bvo,This movie gave us a goblin that actually felt on par with the comic one. And I live for it,ri7eum
hp6ty00,If anything he‚Äôs gotten better.,ri7eum
hpia1qn,I could easily listen to the three Spider-Men talking to each other for a solid hour,ri7eum
hpmpp0q,"Someone change my mind:

Dafoe's Green Goblin is the best MCU villain.",ri7eum
hp9f364,Put Dafoe on the list? He was absolutely already on that list. This movie more of an affirmation of that.,ri7eum
hovofpe,"Loved how he came in at the end to assist the Spider-Men.

Molina slipped back into the role with ease. Loved how he was utilized in the movie.",ri7eum
hovrb0p,"Even though it was in the trailer, hearing Molina say 'hello, Peter' gave me chills in the theater. Such a rare moment of a line really hitting me despite having heard it to over saturation before release.",ri7eum
how3j0j,Doc Ock and Tobey McGuire‚Äôs reunion was really sweet and nice. I loved seeing Doc Ock again.,ri7eum
hovrkbn,Everyone was on point with their acting. It feels like we got the best performances out of everyone. Which makes it even more special.,ri7eum
hovyh38,I was so scared that he was also gonna come back as a baddie again with Electro having fried his chip or something,ri7eum
hovz3ph,Him being the first villain to show gave him some time to shine before Dafoe shows up to steal the movie.,ri7eum
hoyl4uh,"""My dear boy, how are you?""



""Trying to do better""



Instant waterworks for me",ri7eum
how0d48,"I love Dafoe, don't get me wrong. But Molina's Doc Ock was 10 times better a villain in the Raimi movies",ri7eum
howfvqh,"Yessss I fucking loved seeing a sane doc ock, and when Toby and him have a little hey what's up man moment, such a cool feeling.",ri7eum
howdhut,"I think it's because he's the true character that had that emotional pay off of ""he's bad but there's a reason why"" so when you see him be bad, you know he's capable of better and to watch that come to fruition is immensely satisfying.",ri7eum
hoxw6mk,"The fact that multiple actors are being referred to as stealing the show (Molina, Dafoe, Garfield) just goes to show how incredibly well acted this movie was.",ri7eum
how6904,He didn't die monster.,ri7eum
hp579rq,"Even Jamie Fox was so much better in this movie.  Just took a better script. 

Also they finally gave Marisa Tomei some stuff to act and she killed it as usual.",ri7eum
hoxa9gk,"Hard same. Like Poochie, every time he wasn't on screen, I was thinking ""Where's Otto?""

For real, though, he was absolutely phenomenal. By the end of his first scene, I was already bummed we probably won't see any more of him.",ri7eum
hovzp6s,"Seeing Molina as Doc Ock in his redeemed state for more than the few seconds he got at the end of *Spider-Man 2* felt like finally exhaling after almost twenty years. Just a long, slow, satisfying breath. This was the closure the character deserved to enjoy, and it gave me *so* much catharsis.",ri7eum
hp07ea3,"The Amazing-verse characters all showed marked improvement, but every Raimi-verse character never missed a beat after nearly 15 years.",ri7eum
hoye7dn,"Due to his redemption at the end of SM2 and his mentor role in the PS4 game, I was so happy that he was fixed first so that we could get a good  Doc Oc for once.",ri7eum
hp2jzww,"Him becoming a good guy actually makes perfect sense, given that at the end of Spider-Man 2, he ends up having a moment of clarity and realizing that his machine is doomed to fail and cause horrible destruction, and sacrifices himself to destroy it.  The AI in the claws was never just a force of pure evil like the Green Goblin, they were just obsessed with fulfilling the ultimate purpose that they were designed for (building the machine).",ri7eum
hoxyc9r,The power of sun was in the palm of his hands twice,ri7eum
howl1rk,"I think there very a little bit too many jokes on Ottos behalf in the first half (as an example, the question of May what water he wants to drink was so weird because... he has four metal arms. He is not literally an octopus, this question doesn't make any sense and is only there for a cheap laugh) but after the 'I don't hear the voices anymore' scene it was really great. I loved seeing Molina return, he was with Dafoe the highlight of this movie.",ri7eum
hozluoe,"I know when the trailers first came out, people were worried about how they'd treat Doc Ock's character since he had a full redemption arc. Glad they did him justice.",ri7eum
hp0gab2,He's Alfred Molina. He's the best thing in everything he's in.,ri7eum
hp7p1zy,This movie made Spider-Man 2 even better. I was always sad doc ock‚Äôs chip burnt out and he was being manipulated by his tentacles. Such a great scene seeing him wake up and point out how quiet it was now.,ri7eum
hoz909z,"Was hoping when he stopped electro he was going to say ""I will not die a monster"". Too on the nose I guess.",ri7eum
hovtfzp,"Sad that he probably dies because all the other villians died (or didn't really died) because they were trying to do something lethal to someone else and now they can change that. Doc Ock actively killed himself... but hey!!!! his last words became true: he didn't die as a monster, he died as a hero now.",ri7eum
hozl417,"Out of ALLLL the Spider-man movies, the Subway scene in Spider-man 2 is the best. I tear up every time I see it.",ri7eum
hq0urii,"He finally had control of the arms.

He finally had the power of the sun in the palm of his hands.

He finally got to see Peter, his favourite student again.",ri7eum
hp9ie7q,I was honestly just dissapointed he didn't show up more after Happy's apartment. I was kind of expecting something more from him after that I guess. Tbh i thought he was still bad. I even maybe thought they were gonna do a Superior Spiderman thing with a the tech exchanges between him and Spidey,ri7eum
hoxe7jv,I didn't realise it was him. He looks much younger then I remembered and I advoided all new sources and IMDb so I didn't know,ri7eum
hozry72,"Felt to me after the Bridge Fight, they clowned on him the whole movie. Then when he became good again, he didn't really do anything. Just kinda popped up out of nowhere for like a minute in the final fight. Would've been cool to see him science shit out with the 3 spideys.

Sorry, I just didn't like the movie as much as most people, or as much as I wanted to...",ri7eum
hp5fsrt,"yeah, holy shit. all of his lines, esp before he gets saved, are just powerful. His energy is just so brutal",ri7eum
hp6rro0,I was surprised how easily he beat electro. Like electro just stood there and let me grab the reactor.,ri7eum
hp8l53n,Making him a good guy was a great choice considering it really was just his tentacles that had turned him evil. Once they were removed he was the same man that Peter had respected and looked up to.,ri7eum
hphzu0g,"Eh, he was way better in Spider-Man 2 imo. And that wig looked terrible.",ri7eum
hpz23p1,"Honestly, DeFoe and Molina have the chops to steal the whole show.",ri7eum
hxolrgv,"When he wasnt able to control his arms, he was acting like and looking like Chevy on Community throwing a fit while wearing a wig and it was hilarious",ri7eum
ia99wep,"Since Doc Ock is the Superior Spider man, we really got the *four* spidermen in this movie. 

Docs a good guy, and Molina stole the entire goddamn Raimi franchise. He is so god damn good.",ri7eum
howh2w0,All the Spider-Men being super wholesome and supportive of each other was phenomenal to see. You love to see self worth actualized.,ri7eum
hoxo3zj,"Man I don't know about you, but when the first TASM came out, a lot of people on Reddit and irl were hailing it as a good start and a lot of people were saying it was better than the Raimi films since it was more true to the comics. It really wasn't until the handling of the 2nd film that people switched.",ri7eum
hoyqdm7,Andrew was unbelievable as the frenetic and slightly insecure middle brother between Tobey‚Äôs wise older brother energy and Tom‚Äôs favourite child still-learning energy.,ri7eum
how9lmg,"When Andrew called himself lame and Tobey called him amazing, my audience erupted. It‚Äôs crazy too because Andrew used to be considered the worst and now he‚Äôs arguably the most popular (from what I‚Äôve seen and my theater‚Äôs reaction to him)? So glad that he got his due though, he‚Äôs been my favorite for a while!",ri7eum
hoz1vdi,"Also, *Amazing* Spider-Man",ri7eum
howvh3k,Amazing Spider-man is now canonically good in the Raimiverse,ri7eum
howg4bx,"I‚Äôm definitely in a minority but I also thought Andrew was the best Spider-Man stuck in average movies with lower tier villains. Overall, Tobey‚Äôs movies will always hold a special place in my heart. And oddly enough, Tom‚Äôs Spider-Man is my least favorite.",ri7eum
hp1344g,You know I didn‚Äôt like Andrew‚Äôs Spider-Man or the movies.  And this movie somehow flipped the switched for me.  It made actually kind nostalgic for Andrew and his movies.  Good job MCU.,ri7eum
howh0u5,"I was so happy with that scene. Its like that scene is supposed to be for the fans who keep fighting over who's the best and who's not. And yeah Andrew is my fav too, he's got so much love for the character.",ri7eum
hp0uhmp,He‚Äôs not just amazing he‚Äôs The Amazing Spider-man,ri7eum
hp2ykaa,He was a great Peter and Spidey it's just that his villains were really bad sadly they even had to fix Electro for this movie and Lizard was just a lizard,ri7eum
hp2ex4x,"I didn't mind the ASM movies, but something about Garfield didn't quite stick with me at the time.  I might've been bitter about Tobey being recasted, and I feel bad because I really should have appreciated Andrew's performance more back then.  It took time, but eventually I find myself enjoying those movies.  I'm glad he was in this movie, because it gave me that chance to smile, laugh, and properly applaud his performance in a way that I didn't back then.  It was just a beautiful moment to see all 3 Spidermen together.",ri7eum
hoy4of5,"I never really got that impression. If anything, Andrew really highlighted how humorless Tobey‚Äôs Spider-Man was.

Tobey was too nerdy, Andrew was too cool, Tom is juuust right.",ri7eum
hp43na3,The best part about that scene was how he called him amazing like three times. I imagine they were doing that as a joke towards the title of his movies. Can‚Äôt be a coincide they used the word amazing right?,ri7eum
hpj0idl,"I think his performance was never questioned, it was the story and script. I thought he was always rated as the best actor, both with and without the spider costume on. I mean even in this movie, he showed that he can really act.",ri7eum
hp3gejq,He was a great spider-man. The movies just weren't the greatest and people criticize things without really thinking about what they are saying. The equivalent to people not liking a game and giving it a 0/10 LOL,ri7eum
hp6ft2y,"I always really, really liked Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man. I feel he was let down by too much studio interference, especially with ASM2.",ri7eum
hp7e5ax,Telling the Amazing Spider-man that he's Amazing over and over haha,ri7eum
hpadk45,"I've never heard people shit on the performances of Garfield's movies. It's mostly just about how weak the scripts were. The principle cast Garfield, Stone, Sheen, Fields, etc have a string of acting awards between them.",ri7eum
hpe171u,"i think this is a reference to his being ""The Amazing Spiderman""",ri7eum
hpeu5q8,"Andrew is my favorite Spider-Man because he nails the quick quips. Like when he first comes out and is webbing the car thief against the wall and messing with the cop, it‚Äôs great",ri7eum
hpj7y8w,"In my audience, for some reason Andrew got more cheers than Tobey when Ned found them. Threw me for a loop.",ri7eum
hr13g1c,"‚ÄúI‚Äôve always wanted brothers.‚Äù 

That line got to me.",ri7eum
hr5rg7w,"I snort laughed when I heard that! My GF was not happy as she felt I ruined the moment.

I had to explain to explain to her it was an 'The Amazing Spider-Man' Joke/Reference. Andrew is amazing.... The Amazing Spider-Man.",ri7eum
hp0eo4y,"The Amazing Spider-Man movies are real bad, and so clearly just pins in the film rights for Sony.
But I really don't think Andrew's performance was a significant part of that problem. I thought he did well, especially considering the quality of the rest of the films.
Was glad to see all 3 got as much humanity and depth as I could have hoped for.",ri7eum
howxi9p,"Same. I thought they'd show up for the final fight then go home. I didn't expect them to show up halfway into the movie, be integral to every scene afterwards and provide wisdom, banter and camaraderie to Holland. There were so many rumors, so many lofty expectations, and yet it still somehow blew them out of the water.",ri7eum
how7kyf,When Tobey showed up in street clothes I was so sad because I figured that meant he wouldn't be fighting.,ri7eum
howplt3,"""Can you shoot webs... from other places?""",ri7eum
hows25o,"I was surprised how many nice, thoughtful conversations and interactions they were able to include from just about everyone considering all the different characters and seemingly constant action they had to handle. The Spiderman trio, Ned and MJ, all the villains, Aunt May and Happy, Doctor Strange, they all had their funny and meaningful moments, while still leaving room for plenty of action-packed fight scenes. I actually felt like everyone got pretty decent screen-time by the end of it.",ri7eum
hoze2c0,"I wish the movie had been a bit more brave in offering insight into what they've been up to since their movies. When they were swapping stories about who they've fought I would have loved for one of them to talk about Kraven or Black Cat or something. 

They played it kinda safe by only referencing already-canon villains.",ri7eum
hoxjkfl,"Also loved when they all had a mini podcast section, all 3 Spider-Man talking about their past villains and how Andrew Garfield‚Äôs Spider-Man hasn‚Äôt fought any aliens like the other two.",ri7eum
hoy56gg,"You've been in the Avengers?
What's that?
Lol",ri7eum
hp0f43w,"Andrew saying ""I want to fight an Alien"" killed me lol.",ri7eum
howq975,Was there a quick cameo by Nicholas Hammond? I thought the older guy at the doughnut shop at the end might be him.,ri7eum
hoy7vkg,"You mean like the OG Ghostbusters in Afterlife?  They were in the final scene and that was about it, I was a little disappointed at that?  Loved NWH, was really good.",ri7eum
hoxhx2o,"""Those webs that come out of your wrists... Do they come out of anywhere else?""",ri7eum
hp3nv01,"I avoided qatching any trailers and spoilers and I totally thought they'd be part of the stinger, like they just missed out on the third act big battle. I never imagined they'd be the co-stars",ri7eum
hoz7w4a,For real. Just enough of the three Spider-Men in this movie.,ri7eum
hp0pedd,"I was thinking that they would meet him give him some inspiration and that's it, 5 minutes bing bang boom and then MCU Spiderman would be alone Vs all of the villains",ri7eum
hp2jiw7,I could have had an hour of them swapping stories.,ri7eum
hp54ldj,"This is what I loved about the scene before the final showdown! They‚Äôre just telling their experiences to each other‚Ä¶because if I ever met two other versions of myself, I would definitely love to hear what their life has been, the struggles/wins etc",ri7eum
hoxpd0e,"I would be more happy if this part would be a more surprised one. Like, they just appear out of nowhere. With the portals you already were sure another Spider Man was there.",ri7eum
hp0wuoq,Oh my heavens thank God for this.,ri7eum
hq9ala3,"Honestly, if your going to bring back old characters for nostalgia, this is how you do it. Don't put them in for cameos, but make them integral, and push the current holder of the mantle through their paces. It felt like they handed the torch to tom by the end of the film",ri7eum
hoyl7bf,"This definitely!  I was figuring the same thing, I'm glad I was wrong!",ri7eum
howzdwk,Tbh that was my favorite part! It was the most Peter Parker moment ever!,ri7eum
hp0htp2,"Would have been great if at the end when they start disappearing that a CGI Spider Pig voiced by John Mulaney shows up all ‚ÄúI saw something on the news, guess I‚Äôm a little late‚Äù and Tobey/Garfield disappear in complete bewilderment at a talking pig.",ri7eum
hp296ay,"Having never seen any trailers nor heard news, I was genuinely surprised to see them. But the weird greenscreen background when they stepped theough the portal, I was expecting them to peace out and go back out. Didn‚Äôt they‚Äôre gonna stay all the way through to the last battle.",ri7eum
howp37g,You could tell from the last trailer that they were edited out or Toms head edited over theirs like in the save the falling MJ scene,ri7eum
hupqhlr,They could've saved hundreds of millions of dollars in special effects and just have 45 minutes of these three doing a podcast and I'd paid to watch that.,ri7eum
hox2pzl,See I thought all that talk shit was unnecessary. Dragged the movie on. They should have cut all that out and did a bigger fight scene. I also think the fight scene with GG should have been much bigger.,ri7eum
howhkkn,"One of the scenes that hit me the hardest was the rain sequence where Peter just looks devastated while Jameson blames Spider-Man for May‚Äôs death. That wide angle where the massive screen is blasting the Daily Bugle while Peter looks small and worn down in the dark rain of Times Square is probably the best shot of the movie imo.

EDIT: Looks a lot like this poster, it‚Äôs so good https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/r83rf6/new_spiderman_no_way_home_screen_x_poster/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",ri7eum
hox37ji,Seeing MJ and Ned going on about their normal lives at the donut shop after their memories of Peter got wiped and all Peter can do is just not reintroduce himself to them is heartbreaking yet bittersweet as the two remained friends still.,ri7eum
howb73o,"Man that's the most spiderman thing he's ever done, this feels like a perfect new begging for the wall crawler.",ri7eum
hp145c5,"Happy asking how Peter knew Aunt May killed me.

It makes sense that she kind of had to die because she was his last living relative and it would be too weird if she forgot him.",ri7eum
hoy8kqi,"I‚Äôm still not sure that door remains shut long term, hard to think that give Ned magic only to shelf him with no story.",ri7eum
howhqcy,"I totally missed that somehow. I was so confused why he wouldn't at least try his luck with Ned. It'd be so easy. ""Hey, buddy, you like Star Wars? You wanna be friends?""",ri7eum
hp1ympc,"I heard people in the theater quietly crying

I totally understand

God damn. I really love this work of fiction that I've been following for most of my life",ri7eum
hp9j702,It's such an overused hero arc tho that it just doesn't hit with me anymore. It's more annoying than anything at this point.,ri7eum
hp8ab4w,"The ending was the only dumb part. Pretending he can keep his friends safe by not getting them involved is selfish. Some friends want to help! Mj and Ned are more than willing to put their life on the line to help their friend Peter. That is their choice and they were stripped of it by Dr strange and then once more by Peter.

I feel like this choice wasted away the chemistry these 3 developed over the 3 movies.",ri7eum
how9c3c,"I think he's still tries to reach out to them, he's trying to go to MIT (look at the GED Prep book when he moves in to his new apartment)

It's just Peter doesn't want to destroy their moment being accepted to MIT and thinks it is not the right time.",ri7eum
hp360kx,"Same. It‚Äôs the classic spider-man ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not safe to be with me‚Äù scenario. I am confident it won‚Äôt stay that way. He will eventually go back to them, and it‚Äôs what they wanted.",ri7eum
hoy8qcs,"Yeah it was terrible. But it was such a classic Spider-Man type moment that I was happy from a writing standpoint. Damn, this movie was really good",ri7eum
hoy8eqq,That just hit me. My poor baby Peter üò≠,ri7eum
hp4lphh,It's like the opposite of it's a wonderful life lol,ri7eum
hp80dfj,"I'm so tired of this stupid cliche. It's always framed as a selfless and normal choice instead of it being what it is. And it's always sexist too. ""Oh, I promised her something, but I and only I know what's better for her and I and only I can and will decide for her"".",ri7eum
hp56mh2,Man I teared up like 4 times in this movie. After a pretty comical first half. It was emotional. And I don't cry much for movies. Definitely not superhero movies.,ri7eum
hr62cas,I thought the spell was supposed to make everyone forget he‚Äôs Spider-Man. Why don‚Äôt MJ and Ned remember Peter? Does that mean he doesn‚Äôt go to school with them?,ri7eum
hovzt9r,I dunno. He promised MJ and Ned he'd find them. The ending just felt like a less shitty way to do One More Day while still being a shitty ending to an otherwise probably the best Spidey film.,ri7eum
hp8qm0m,so true‚Ä¶ i really didn‚Äôt need that right now,ri7eum

hoy89y3,"If you want to frame it one way, MIT's admissions department killed Aunt May",ri7eum
hoyszph,"I don't really understand why the public dislikes Spider-Man, why him just saying ""no i didn't do that, you know me, I saved half the planet."" wouldn't be enough.",ri7eum
hox62bp,"I mean not to defend hypothetical MIT here, but approximately half of the country considers Parker a murderer of the first interdimensional traveler. That would 100% qualify him as a deeply controversial figure- the type of person no school wants to admit. 

Also, teensy little plot hole- MIT is **famous** for sending their admissions decisions on March 14th (œÄ day). Weird they get their results around November.

EDIT: Early decision exists no plot hole.",ri7eum
hp0zq67,"At the end of the movie when dr strange was literally holding the fabric of the universe together with his mind and they were discussing casting the spell to make everyone forget Peter... 

I was like...

All this because he wanted to go to MIT with his friends...

May dead.
Friends don‚Äôt even know him and forget years of friendship.
Tobey stabbed pretty badly.
Statue of Liberty fucked ass up.

Really, what was meant to be a joke for us, but was a serious question by Dr. Strange at the beginning of the movie, could have saved a lot of headache...

‚ÄúJust call the damn school and plead your case.‚Äù",ri7eum
howahb8,Your not wrong! They are a bit of scientists themselves.,ri7eum
hoy0kbz,"I agree that it's bullshit of them to reject the three of them simply because of their connection to Spiderman. But I think there was some decent reasoning behind their decision, in that having him there would be a massive liability. Any villain could show up at anytime, which would damage the school and endanger the lives of all of the other students. The same goes for Ned and MJ, since they could also be targeted for their connection to Peter. It's the school's responsibility to provide a safe environment for and protect their students, and letting Peter go there would achieve the opposite.",ri7eum
hp05hqf,What I don‚Äôt get is that flash got accepted into MIT yet he was publicly claiming to be peters friend. Surely they would reject him too,ri7eum
howqz52,I saw it more as an issue about how now that Peter Parker has a huge target on his back since all his enemies know him that the mit isn't really prepared to have that kind of threat to all the other students,ri7eum
howkvqx,They forget who paid for the student's projects and who has the controlling assets now.,ri7eum
hoyb9ah,"I mean I think they did a great job in Act 1 pointing out how dangerous, reckless, and illegal Spider-Man actually is, especially this Spider-Man who thinks he's an avenger and never really learned to be Friendly Neighborhood. Hopefully this soft reboot means he'll tone it down a bit",ri7eum
how482n,"If you were MIT, would you want to admit three people, one a superhero who lost the battle in the public opinion and his two friends to your school, who will then have media setup just off campus to continuously invade campus property to report on Spiderman? 

They weren't originally accepted because of their grades or their capabilities in the future. Being associated with Spiderman brings unnecessary publicity and scrutiny towards them. Since the fake news backlash of Mysterio putting Peter's identity, no respectable school would want to be involved in a future scandal because of them.",ri7eum
hox6b8i,"I can understand them refusing Peter, he was being accused of actual murder after all, but his friends? That's messed up man.",ri7eum
hoyfbq7,"At the end when Peter‚Äôs moving into his new apartment, he has a GED exam book. If Peter Parker doesn‚Äôt exist, none of his accomplishments are recorded‚Ä¶ he never had test scores, admission letters, or graduated. He sacrificed everything, knowing he‚Äôd have to build it all from the ground up.",ri7eum
hoy3nh5,You‚Äôre saying MIT is dumb?,ri7eum
hp3hjwx,"Honestly, the first 30 minutes of this movie were staggeringly stupid. 

That the multiverse gets fucked up because Pete's friend's got rejected from college because they were so controversial (yet... Flash got in for writing a book about being Peter's friend, and wanted Peter to admit as much).

&#x200B;

So, so dumb.",ri7eum
hoxht3y,I honestly think they were more worried about possible property damage,ri7eum
hox4mtu,"I figured that was a side effect of the whole world forgetting Peter Parker even exists. The dean would've forgotten to help Peter get in, but she still would've remembered that she was planning on helping MJ and Ned.",ri7eum
hoxwc0o,Sheldon did say MIT was just a glorified trade school .,ri7eum
hoxc1vi,"Nah that's just MIT admissions. Its still unrealistic because they wouldn't turn him down for political reasons, they just have impossible standards.

Yes I'm bitter, why do you ask?",ri7eum
hoxtf41,"In all fairness, there's also the possibility he's magnet for property damage and avengers level attacks",ri7eum
hp3gj18,He almost got that lady killed because Dr Oct was looking for him. They would risk having these crazy villians showing up at MIT to find Peter Parker lol,ri7eum
hpi8pey,Was just thinking that. Most unbelievable part about this movie is the fact that MIT wouldn‚Äôt accept the most famous person in the world at the moment.,ri7eum
hoxcdca,"Who MIT, I haven‚Äôt seen it yet",ri7eum
how81uo,[deleted],ri7eum
hoxixqf,"What have Ned or MJ done to deserve to go to MIT? Be friends with Spider-Man?

We never see them do anything science related.",ri7eum

hoyk5ff,"You know what caused multiverse madness..?  
MIT",ri7eum
hozjjm2,"Peter also had an internship with Tony Stark, who was basically a world-renowned supergenius in this universe. They'd be idiots not to accept him.
  
Maybe it's cuz it took Peter, MJ, and Ned 9 years to finish high school...",ri7eum

Right!?!? I never actually watched ASM2, but now I will lol",ri7eum
hp0y94q,"What hinted me was the voice changing while he was ""working on the antidote""",ri7eum
hoyb60y,I missed this! But the whole Spidey sense scene is so good. Thought that would be when the other Spideys would show up but it turned out to be so tense and hostile.,ri7eum
hozi6nb,I thought I was seeing things!  Glad I‚Äôm not crazy.,ri7eum

hovm61t,Damn missed that.,ri7eum
hp109wz,"I wasn't sure if I was over thinking that or not, because I totally noticed that too.",ri7eum
hp850im,Biggest foreshadow for me was when his tone of voice changed.,ri7eum
hp5bil6,As if I needed a reason to see it again but I will be looking for this now,ri7eum
hqjtg4j,"not just that, but the green jacket and purple hoodie he has on.....and then his final ""form"" was the hooded goblin. SO epic!",ri7eum
hp2i8em,I didn't catch that--that's clever!,ri7eum
hp7dydo,Wow! That's an amazing observation,ri7eum
hptdhwm,I NOTICED THAT TOO it was such an insane attention to detail,ri7eum
hpzuk05,For me it was his voice‚Ä¶ He has a subtle deeper and twisted voice as Gobbie,ri7eum

hp8y4i6,You'll get your Tobey when you fix this goddamn door!,ri7eum
how999i,"Went for Tobey as welI. Was gonna be hugely disappointed, angered even, if Garfield was in it but not the REAL Spider-man. Rejoiced at seeing him being Spider-man. Kept reminding myself this was probably the last time seeing him in the suit so enjoy it. Loved his ‚ÄúWoooHooo‚Äù going into the last fight. Also the original scoring from the first trilogy was played at the end. Loved that and Tobey.",ri7eum
hpx726i,\*insert 'They love me' Tobey meme here\*,ri7eum

hqt6sch,Same :3 was SO satisfied,ri7eum
hpijfw1,I was soo happy when they finally introduced him... couldnt care for Garfield by Toby that man is OG Spider Man,ri7eum
hozi1w1,I love how he just powerbombed the shit out of him,ri7eum
hp8kkud,"I liked how Garfield said later on ""I stopped pulling my punches"" following Gwen's murder. Suggested to me that this Peter is holding back, which to me makes sense. 

He's still a young fella, and until May's death, hadn't really experienced much in the way of loss or emotional pain. To really use all the strength he can muster, he's gotta be willing to really hurt the other guy. I don't think a young, unscared Peter can bring that kind of viciousness to a fight. Now he can.",ri7eum
hp2nfom,Impossible to imagine recasting. They should just do Hobgoblin in the MCU instead. Cooler costume anyway.,ri7eum
hp2wnxw,Reminds me of Joker in the interrogation scene in The Dark Knight,ri7eum
hphrpqj,When daredevil shows up you know a brutal hallway fight is coming,ri7eum
hpfius5,"So, I'm really not trying to bring too much logic to this movie.  However...

Did Green Goblin have super strength before?  I haven't seen the original in a while.  But it seemed like he wasn't wearing the suit, yet he could kick spider man's ass, who just earlier basically held a car with one hand.   I didn't get how that worked",ri7eum
i0hl06i,"Kind of an interesting contrast in how a 2021(2022?) MCU fight scene is choreographed vs. a Rami Spider-Man film. That hallway scene, it kind of felt like the fight director threw in some simple, light versions of contemporary grappling/MMA moves that would not have fit the tone of the Rami trilogy. So you see Goblin applying his strength and endurance in new, more grounded, but also more brutal and direct ways, and TomSpider mounting on his shoulders to pound away with his fists was also notable, I thought. 

But maybe I'm just imagining and projecting from what I've seen of the overall direction of fight choreography in American TV/films in the past couple of decades. Feels like the way fight scenes are shot, post-Bourne I would say, there's a lot less Matrixy slow motion swoopy swappy Hong Kong flippidy flappy, and more ""realistic"" moves and sequences. For a consistent illustration of this, watch every ""Universal Soldier"" film from the very first one in the 90s up to the latest one, and you'll see lots of MMA, Arnis/Kali, army combatives type stuff building up over the years.

Superhero movies being what they are, there's always going to be someone kicked in the chest, flying 20 ft. and picking themselves up like it's nothing, but the Netflix shows obviously had more leeway to work in the ""realistic"" fight styles, esp. in the Daredevil and Punisher series.",ri7eum

howxda2,bro I was about to scream. I took everything I got to not yell scream and wheeze at this reveal. It was much mor eimpactful than tobeys and andrews appearance cause you sorta expected it despite ever being confirmed but I love the Daredevil show so much that I was so happy to see him back... this will be fantastic he will be a great supporting character in the movies and hopefully plays major roles in the shows,ri7eum

It was fun seeing a movie in a pretty packed theatre again. The crowd cheering when Andrew and Tobey showed up was heart warming.  

Spiderman is a fan favorite across every generation. Even if the movies themselves weren't always amazing I got attached to all the Peters in each movie. Andrew Garfield was my favorite spiderman so I was very pleased to see how much people cheered for him and to see how AMAZING he was on screen.",ri7eum

I'm also glad that Daredevil is still in the MCU. I was worried that section was just dead due to Disney+ existing",ri7eum

hoyeqy1,"He definitely fulfilled the role of Peter B, and I think he did it well",ri7eum
hovuuro,I mean... he starred in The Holy Trilogy so... that makes sense.,ri7eum
hposr73,I saw this movie last night with my two buddies who are both youth pastors and all three of us bust out laughing and our wives ragged us hard. It was a great line,ri7eum
hp9mj6w,"Not to be that guy, but the whole thing really is a giant Jesus metaphor. Peter sacrifices everything to save everyone--from the people he cares about most to the ones who deserve it least.",ri7eum
hp15cdn,I feel like he was definitely a bit more wooden than he was back in the day. I haven't seen him in anything in a long time. Does he still act? Is it possible he was out of practice?,ri7eum
hp80o3c,"Nah, he didn't rape Tom, so it was just a nice older brother energy.",ri7eum
hp9rz2c,He was clearly channeling his Uncle Ben,ri7eum
hovl0bb,Agreed. Andrew was hyped and I felt like he just radiated warmth and happiness to be doing this at least one more time from every part he was in.,ri7eum
hovo5ep,"It was heartwarming to see him in the lab, just watching MJ and Peter because that was him and Gwen. To see him get another chance to save MCU Peter's significant other was such a redeeming moment for him.",ri7eum
how0p7q,"I think Tobey got some redemption too at the end stopping Tom from killing Goblin. He let Goblin die by his own glider in the 1, which he prevents in this movie. And also prevents Tom from doing the same revenge killing he did after Uncle Ben died.",ri7eum
how4adl,Man. Seeing Andrew's Spiderman being so down on himself and having Toby's just try so hard to lift him up like a big brother was such an excellent moment for me.,ri7eum
hovjkyp,"I was freaking crying when he saved her. I didn't expect to cry this much from this film.

And when Tobey was talking about how he hunted down Uncle Ben's killer...omg I'm tearing up.

This movie made me think about those old movies. My freaking childhood man....üò≠",ri7eum
hovoqzk,"You know, I saw someone speculate in the comments on one of the trailers that Andrew was going to save her, my friends and I agreed that it was likely, so we all saw it coming.

And yet it was still possibly my favourite moment, especially when Andrew started tearing up.",ri7eum
howgc72,No one is talking about Tobey Maguire's Spidey redemption. He carried the heaviness for kind of killing Norman Osborn. That's why this time he saved him. Maybe he also was freed of the guilt of *killing* his best friend's dad.,ri7eum
howjhvf,"Everyone got redeemed. Toby got to save Norman, and got to see Ock survive and Sandman cured. Electro became cool. Lizard got... to do the same thing again. 

It makes all those films better in retrospect, which is probably the best thing a sequel can do.",ri7eum
hovwmxs,"As he saw her fall and ran forward just as he lept into to air a woman in my theatre quite seriously, almost angrily, shouted out ""DON'T FAIL THIS TIME!!"" and damn that's harsh. But I laughed.",ri7eum
how7yv3,"Andrew completely out-performed Tom and Tobey. Man, I wish they had done his Spider-man movies good, phenomenal actor who deserves some respect.",ri7eum
how904u,I was expecting Emma stone to come at some point. I mean he technically killed her and she knew who Spider-Man was‚Ä¶,ri7eum
howcgar,I've always loved Andrew as Spider-Man. 2 is kinda a mess but I still enjoyed it and the first movie is great. They got too much hate.,ri7eum
how3fwl,Him saying I love you guys was so relatable as me who says that way to often to his bros üòÇ,ri7eum
hovle46,"""...thanks!""",ri7eum
how3pub,Peter 3!,ri7eum
hoyugjv,Yeah you could tell the whole time Garfield's Peter was *going through it.* I watched all of the non-MCU Spider-Man films this week and I think the Amazing films were the most tragic for Peter.,ri7eum
hoxfwjn,"When Tobey accidentally shot him in the face and he's like ""EWW!"" was so funny",ri7eum
hoxmx6y,I‚Äôm convinced ‚ÄúI love you guys‚Äù was just Andrew Garfield speaking from the heart.,ri7eum
how07e7,Wish they didnt fucking put that in trailer since everyone had time to guess who saves Zendaya,ri7eum
hox0abq,"Unpopular opinion but Garfield Spidey was the best version of Spidey. His personality, origin and storyline trajectory was the closest to the source material. Didn‚Äôt like that he was kind of a cool skater bro instead of a miserable nerd but everything else was great. I also find his style of fighting and webbing to be the coolest of the three. Tobey was more of a brawler and Holland likes to rely on his special suit too much. Garfield‚Äôs Spidey uses his wits to improvise and adapt on the go. I miss that about Spider-Man after seeing MCU Spider-Man spend four movies relying on Stark gadgets.",ri7eum
howemb1,"I cried during that scene when Andrew's Spider-Man saved MJ! It was a moment of redemption for him.

I teared up during multiple scenes in the movie. I am so so so glad I was able to watch it in IMAX first day first show!",ri7eum
howds58,"I thought Mey's death got me, but when Andrew saved MJ and then tore up, I was in tears myself. It was so good to see!",ri7eum
hp04ktl,"This was my favorite part of the whole movie. When Tom couldn‚Äôt get to MJ my heart dropped, then I saw Garfield going for her and i almost cried and I immediately thought ‚ÄúHe got a second chance at saving her‚Äù YALL my dad cried at this part, it hit so hard.",ri7eum
hovwav3,"""...thank you.""",ri7eum
howuyjp,"The Gwen save redemption was my favorite moment of the movie. It was done so perfectly, I got chills.",ri7eum
how4o1f,The genuineness really showed in Garfield I absolutely loved that.,ri7eum
hoxwtn6,"Yeah Andrew saving MJ hit me kind of hard, unexpectedly. I didn't cry but I sure a hell welled up with tears.",ri7eum
howcyx5,"His acting was so good, par for the course for him",ri7eum
how7lyi,"He was great in this. That Gwen moment, man.",ri7eum
hoy26zw,"this scene got me thinking that if dead villains can come back, because they knew Peter/Spiderman why couldn't Gwen, Ben etc?  And I wonder if the alt-peters didn't think about that.",ri7eum
hp0bvx3,I had forgotten how much of a complete dork his Spiderman was.,ri7eum
howefwd,"Fuuuck dude he totally learned that webbing a freefalling person is not the best way to save someone, so he jumped instead",ri7eum
how3f6o,I didn't know how much I needed this until I saw it,ri7eum
howpxny,"I don't remember who, but a redditor called this months ago",ri7eum
hoysbyl,"I also love that Tobey's Peter gives him those affirming words and the affirmation he needed. It worked on such a meta level, because Andrew Garfield has talked about how being cast as SpiderMan was so great and the experience ended up being lacking, and how he carried fan disappointment with him. So to hear that ""no, you're amazing"" bit felt so nice (especially as someone who loves Garfield and did think the movies ended up being not great).",ri7eum
hoxiw9c,">Andrew Garfield‚Äôs redemption for Gwen by saving MJ was great

My wife called that from the first trailer to tease it, and even though I expected it when watching the movie, goddamn did I get a lump in my throat when Garfield landed and had tears in his eyes and MJ in his arms.",ri7eum
hoy3zgc,That scene made me think that maybe it wasn‚Äôt actually in the script and Andrew just wanted to let it out how much he loved being Spiderman.,ri7eum
hpdq694,"I wouldn't be surprised if half of the dialog between the spidermen was ad-libbed, just them having fun with each other and enjoying the moment.",ri7eum
howmsw6,Tobey giving positive praise to Andrew was waaayyyyy too good. ‚Äúyou‚Äôre Amazing!!‚Äù,ri7eum
howdv4q,"Yes, I was happy he was able to save MJ at once.",ri7eum
howpjgp,You could tell in the last trailer it was Toms head edited over someone elses.,ri7eum
hp34zo8,So since Electro was ‚Äúsaved‚Äù does this mean that Gwen never died? I was really hoping to see her reunite with Andrew Peter.,ri7eum
hovz3r7,"I normally don't cry watching movies, but this scene made me shed a single tear.",ri7eum
howv297,"I‚Äôm sure it wasn‚Äôt, but when he said that I thought it was a reference to Spiderverse when Spider Noir said he loved the others haha.",ri7eum
hove7vd,They made the right choice by making him the most successful of the villains.,ri7eum
hovaynn,**NORMAN‚ÄôS ON SABBATICAL HONEY**,ri7eum
hovgh51,"You know, he's something of an actor himself.",ri7eum
hovb6zf,"Yeah, that scene in the hallway where Tom keeps punching him but the Goblin just keeps laughing was peek Green Goblin",ri7eum
hoveqec,The bit where he's at FEAST with May and he starts to break down was really moving. It reminded me of some of my older relatives when they got older and their minds started to go.,ri7eum
hovd7bs,He and Garfield were the best part for sure. I‚Äôm glad he got the starting role out all the villains.,ri7eum
hovbwx8,"That hallway fight scene, he was brutal",ri7eum
hovbeo3,He was somehow much much more terrifying this time.,ri7eum
hovaett,Willem Defoe makes *alot* of movies lmao. Not many people do it as well as he does.,ri7eum
hovau2f,What I love so much about Dafoe/Green Goblin compared to other Spider-man villains is that he‚Äôs the only that has that ‚ÄúJoker‚Äù vibe where the insanity is believable. He wants to break the characters down to his level. And he damn near did it again with Tom‚Äôs Peter Parker.,ri7eum
hovgmgc,I love Dafoe‚Äôs evil smile and laugh‚Ä¶he‚Äôs seems like he‚Äôs really enjoying the role which makes me enjoy the role even more,ri7eum
hove5z0,He felt more evil this time around. Was more campy in the original Spiderman movies,ri7eum
hovfd09,"You know, I'm something of a scientist myself",ri7eum
hovaidb,His face is so emotional,ri7eum
hovj6fq,"Producers in 2002: how do we make the Green Goblin scary? Give Willem Dafoe a Power Rangers villain mask

Producers in 2014: how do we make the Green Goblin scary? Give Dane DeHaan 8 hours of makeup so he looks like The Riddler on meth

Producers in 2021 finally getting it right: how do we make the Green Goblin scary? Give Willem Dafoe his real life face",ri7eum
hovibmt,He was amazing in the movie. He stole the scene everytime he reverted to his evil side. Also came off more menacing here than in the 1st movie and his fight scene in the building was awesome.,ri7eum
hovlk4z,I like how everyone went back into character as if they had just played their roles yesterday. The way goblin and doc say ‚ÄúPeter‚Äù was so unique to them back then and to hear it again was surreal.,ri7eum
hovm551,I really appreciate them making him the big baddie over everyone. They could have easily just made him another villain alongside everyone else but I'm so glad they chose to make him the big bad.,ri7eum
hovuqkz,"It was the money call to make Green Goblin the head honcho villain. Dafoe is absolutely GOAT'd, holy shit was he on fire.

In fact, here's a spicy hot take for y'all: he was better here than he was in the original 2002 role.",ri7eum
hovdap4,Was honestly more terrifying here than in the original,ri7eum
hovin8g,There was one scene in particular where it was a really tight shot of his face that just transported me back to one of his best roles as the villain Bobby Peru in my all time fav movie Wild at Heart. Just utterly feral and terrifying.,ri7eum
hovjo43,Right?! The entire audience was applauding virtually every line of his.,ri7eum
hovuou6,"What was so wild was this was a better version of the character.  I was expecting him to be older, more tired, etc.  But he was more animated, more menacing.  He didn‚Äôt need the mask to look like a goblin.",ri7eum
hovwodp,YE FOND OF ME ACTING,ri7eum
how108g,[deleted],ri7eum
hovf23f,His Goblin voice is so creepy. It‚Äôs perfect.,ri7eum
hovsxt8,"He slides into that duality so well.

My family who have the worst memories instantly remembered his goblin. So iconic.",ri7eum
hovugm8,I love how they ditched the mask because they realized the best possible green goblin mask was just Willem Dafoe doing faces,ri7eum
how3lfs,"""You know I'm something of a ~~scientist~~ psychopath myself...""",ri7eum
howcxlm,I was hoping he would stay in the MCU.  MCU would be good with a Norman Osborn,ri7eum
howm7xy,"I always said Willem Dafoe never needed a mask. His face is perfect for the role, and this movie proved it",ri7eum
howz6jv,His speech after Peter spider senses catch the green goblin taking over was great,ri7eum
hovd8ux,His facial expressions were amazing,ri7eum
hovyh2n,He‚Äôd make a great Joker,ri7eum
how4i88,"""I'm something of a scientist myself"" had me dead I WASNT EXPECTING THAT LINE TO BE SAID",ri7eum
how78jl,He was so good and I love that they managed to incorporate the classic costume and his comic version. The purple hoodie was a good choice,ri7eum
howmjqy,"First it seemed like he hadn't aged, and to see him perform the character so perfectly was amazing. Such a good villain.",ri7eum
how06xd,"Not surprising, he's the best actor in it lol",ri7eum
hoyadgk,Just made me realize how damn good of a Joker he would make.,ri7eum
hoyi7sm,He's my favorite spiderman villain of all time,ri7eum
howamrc,ye he was amazing!,ri7eum
hoxblxn,You know I‚Äôm something of a scientist myself‚Ä¶best line/callback in the movie!,ri7eum
hoy7tdw,I love that he said the line,ri7eum
hoy9uaf,I'm looking forward to a movie with Willem Dahero,ri7eum
hoycjpb,I think he‚Äôs the only thing i hadnt read as theories before hand. I assumed it would just be goblin in a suit the whole time.,ri7eum
hoye6zo,"Funny, Jon Watts made the movie for me.",ri7eum
hoynabf,"""you know...""",ri7eum
hozf3oa,Loved the clear insanity on his face while getting punched in the face.,ri7eum
hp0651u,"You know, I'm somewhat of a scientist myself.",ri7eum
hp066ag,"I just wish there was a little more of a plot for him :(

I feel like the villains needed just one more scene between the apartment and the final fight. Just something to round them out a little more.",ri7eum
hp080sd,"Goddam, fucking 20 years and he hadn't lost a beat.",ri7eum
hp0drkv,Not to detract from anyone but his acting is on another level than everybody else was in this. The goblin persona was incredible.,ri7eum
hp0lglf,‚ÄúI‚Äôm something of a scientist myself‚Äù can‚Äôt fucking believe they actually put the meme into the movie.,ri7eum
hp1jivm,He went full Lighthouse for this one. Fucking loved it.,ri7eum
hp2v76x,"absolutely phenomenal performance. the way he switched between personalities was just so seamless, and it's difficult to act as *either* a 'pure evil' or sympathetic villain, let alone *both*. two mvps of the movie for me were him and andrew garfield, for sure.",ri7eum
hp3wqmv,They all were great.,ri7eum
hp4qg5q,My only complaint was they based his Norman character off of the charade he played in the final fight with Spider-Man. Norman was never some week mild mannered scientist.,ri7eum
hp65yum,"I was kinda bummed Peter 1 never said anything to him at the end.

Like he just had the biggest impact on Goblin's life, and he doesn't say a word, or even glance at the guy.

Not expecting them to hug it out but some closure would have been nice.",ri7eum
hp8tkyy,He was phenomenal.  He was seemed so much darker and really brought out the anger in Tom.  I‚Äôm in awe of this whole movie.  I enjoyed it so much,ri7eum
hp9w0ua,how is green goblin so strong? he beat up spiderman.,ri7eum
hpmkumb,He can just make the most evil faces and voices it's crazy,ri7eum
hq3tapz,"I loved that they had Norman destroy the Green Goblin mask almost immediately and just let Willem Dafoe do his thing. 

Dude doesn't need a mask. 

You know exactly when he is which persona. The glint in his eye, the turn of his head, the snide smile...Willem is a master of his craft.",ri7eum
hr11xyz,Willem Dafoe usually does make the movie for us.,ri7eum
hs00rtw,It was like for a moment the MCU got the Joker and the whole debacle he has with the Batman,ri7eum
hs18du5,Damn ye! Let Neptune strike ye dead Winslow! HAAARK!,ri7eum
i193a32,Man was that really his voice? Sounded exactly like Mark Hamill's hob goblin.,ri7eum
hovhmam,Sandman is a total G. Loved that character trait.,ri7eum
hovnpx4,"I love how Otto and Sandam were portrayed in this movie. They are not evil, because they have some sinister ideas, like Connor, they were just victims of accidents",ri7eum
how2fss,I really wish Raimi could have made SM3 without being forced to shove in venom,ri7eum
hovxypr,"I never expected Thomas Haden Church to be shown when he was cured, at all, but when we saw him I smiled ear to ear. He's one of my favorite Spider-Man villains.",ri7eum
hovsb4m,"And then they used the same animation from the Resurrecting Lazarus scene, but in reverse, when he got healed!",ri7eum
howijcn,"Yeah, it makes me wonder *when* precisely Sandman was pulled from his timeline. 

He's on a first-name basis with Peter and it seems genuinely casual as opposed to taunting the hero with ""I know who you are, I know who you are!""

I'd have loved an extra couple lines where Raimi-Peter and Flint talk.",ri7eum
howvvy6,I LOVED Sandman‚Äôs entrance. Man I had the biggest grin on my face throughout the whole movie but for whatever reason him showing up and immediately helping TomPeter felt so rewarding especially with the originality trilogy fresh in my mind after my rewatch.,ri7eum
hoyzuyv,Sandman was a very pragmatic ‚Äúvillain‚Äù. Dude just wanted to protect his daughter in SM3 and he just wanted to go home in NWH.,ri7eum
how80xw,Also proves once again that Ground-type beats Electric-types,ri7eum
hovmil3,"I‚Äôm not a bad person, I just had bad luck",ri7eum
hovhxj5,"Over the years I've just simplified Sandman as saying ""what about my daughter"" over and over again so it was nice to shake that.

Though I did laugh when he said it this time.",ri7eum
hp35v5j,"He is a ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs a bad guy",ri7eum
howmclg,"Sandman is a really well done character, a villain whose motivations are very understandable and discussable.",ri7eum
how5wu4,"That was because Sandman was the  standalone villain in raimi Spiderman 3, no harry no venom. There's a whole story, articles and shit out there of  how producers forced Sam in making the movie like the way it is now. They had ideas of making sinister 6...with all these villains. At the end, the idea and the film was a hot mess. But we got our memes, so... it's all good I guess",ri7eum
how3ljy,"Sandman was such an overlooked, but well utilized character in this I thought.",ri7eum
hoxmsvf,But it was kinda messed up that he was about to kill Maguire by drowning him in his sand at the end,ri7eum
hovcoij,It made his heel turn at the end make no sense though.,ri7eum
hox105u,Havent seen the old movies in years. Why were they on goos terms? I was really confused about that.,ri7eum
hoxdxt7,I wish we could've seen more of his face and not have him be shrouded in CGI for the most part.,ri7eum
hoz5spo,"If SM 3 was purely about sandman and lost the bloat of the others, it'd be known know as a classic",ri7eum
howcweh,Sandman for the rest of the movie: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care.‚Äù *attacks Peter*,ri7eum
hoybiq4,"Sandman was ok for me in Spider-Man 3 (though choosing to make him good in the end was ick), but him fucking shit up and then him just leaving and Spider-Man just being like ""yeah ok that's totally fine"" was so damn bizarre",ri7eum
hoyeg69,"I loved that. I just wish that they let him look like himself during the movie, rather than pure sand",ri7eum
howl38n,"Garfields line delivery in this movie was so perfect. The ""aw man im sorry"" got the biggest laugh out of me.",ri7eum

Miles Morales for Phase 5!",ri7eum
howw6nq,"I thought the line was great, but when I thought about it afterwards I got a little confused since I thought the whole bit with the spell was that only folks who knew Spider-Man‚Äôs identity were supposed to be drawn in üòÖ",ri7eum
hoxxhm8,"That electro line hurts hard, reminds me of the Stan Lee quote about Spider-Man ‚Äúanyone can be behind the mask, be it sex, religion, race, gender or creed.‚Äù",ri7eum
hoy1wug,Really wish electro had been like ‚Äòy‚Äôall have that show COMMUNITY over here?‚Äù,ri7eum
hoz89ga,"I thought this dialog was great both as a nod to miles morales but also a homage to stan lee and what he said about spiderman which is so true (because it's a full body suit, anyone can relate to spiderman, since it could be anyone under it, doesn't matter it's race) it's just captures the essence of the character",ri7eum
hoyw9ub,"I swear in the last second of the film when Peter is diving down and it focuses on his eyes, they change to animated look of spiderverse",ri7eum
hoy33h3,I liked the joke but didn‚Äôt make sense for the story. People who got pulled through knew Parker was Spider-Man so then why did he think Peter was black,ri7eum
hoy3kgw,There was a little girl who sat behind me who shouted ‚Äúthere is!!‚Äù and that warmed my heart.,ri7eum

Also, it's my theory that after the Peter Parker mind-wipe, Miles Morales is now Spider-Man. It's the only way I can wrap my head around Happy knowing May through Spider-Man but not knowing about Peter. Like, we know that Miles does a bit of volunteering at FEAST, so...",ri7eum
hoxe7t8,"nice opening to bring Miles Morales in as spidey in future,",ri7eum

hovwtrk,"Will he attend Empire State University and meet Gwen, Harry, and Felicia?",ri7eum
how34u4,">  I also wouldn't mind Peter moving forward.

Is it moving forward or running away? Spiderman will always endanger those he loves true but the lesson has always been that it's their choice and that Peter needs them to be able to be himself. Whenever he's alone and isolated things get bad fast.",ri7eum
hovsovz,That end was so fucking sad but great at the same time. We get classic Peter Parker Spider-man now without him being white Miles or Tony Stark Jr. But you feel so fucking sad for the character.,ri7eum
hoy3aa7,"I thought for sure when Ned walked in that he and MJ were going to be in a relationship, and that's why Peter would back off. Glad it didn't actually go that way, too trope.",ri7eum
hox8pn5,"Him talking to Happy at the end implied that people still remembered all the things he did as spiderman, they just forgot about Peter Parker.  So in terms of interacting with other avengers, they should still remember working with spiderman, just not that he was Peter.",ri7eum
hoyu8fo,"Exactly.  I agree that the the MCU Trilogy and Peter's appearances in other films are essentially a protracted origin story for this version of Spider-Man.  The moment with May telling him the famous line clinches it in my mind.  The Home Trilogy as you call it is basically the Smallville TV Series for Peter Parker.

  
The film basically ends with Peter back to square one in many ways but with new determination to be Spider-Man.  New suit sewn by him.  Without his Stark Tech, the training wheels really are officially off.

  
This is also a soft reset for the character.  None of his current supporting cast with possibly the newest addition of JJJ will or are required to appear in the next trilogy, if it happens.  This is also smart of Sony to the extent that certain characters are solely MCU only, in case the partnership with Marvel falls through.",ri7eum
hoxn6v7,Why does it feel like the ending was a way to write Spider-Man out of the MCU. I really hope it‚Äôs not the case,ri7eum
hoyamr1,"Peter Parker is a genius. I get he wants to be prepared but he‚Äôll probably pass with flying colors hung over taking the test. 

I barely went to school growing up.  A combo of being homeless, moving like crazy, and no scholastic motivation.  

I strolled into the GED testing place and passed it without studying and I‚Äôm a bit of an idiot.",ri7eum
hozo01z,"I sooooo want more of Zendaya's MJ, but this was honestly a great opportunity for her to bow out, and I would imagine, with so many films and projects on her slate for coming years, her time is probably pretty expensive now. 

Just to say, I won't be surprised is that's 3 and done for her. But I hope she comes back.",ri7eum
hovxwcd,"Something has been missing from this Spider-Man and I think it‚Äôs the Daily Bugle. I just love seeing Peter Parker with a camera in his hands, and I don‚Äôt think Holland has held one yet. Can‚Äôt wait to see him take a deep breath and go to Jameson with some Spidey pics because he has to pay rent",ri7eum
hoxay9c,"I'm very curious if MJ and Ned will be out of it. I suspect they may be gone for the next movie, but get hinted at in a post credits scene and come back in 5. Even if you wipe the record books, there is a peter parker shaped hole in their lives. I can see them getting sciencey and describing it like observing a black hole: you cant see the black hole, but you can see the way it has affected everything around it.",ri7eum
hoylzro,"> With the knowledge that there's another trilogy in store for us, it makes the ""Home Trilogy"" feel like a prologue to Spider-man proper. With really no backup at all now, Peter bravely goes into the world donning his hand made spidey suit.

I think it really was the best method to go to set up the character of MCU Spider, doing another introduction of how he got his powers and his uncle Ben dying would have been way too tired at the point where we were in the MCU. We needed different motivations and actions from him that we hadn't seen before. 

Now that we've seen how he individually handles strife and conflict, and we've seen how he fits in to the world of the MCU and the team of the Avengers, we can see a more introspective take with him.",ri7eum

Does he remember the trip to Germany at all? How did Peter get all of his stuff? Supposedly it would have all been in Happy's apartment, did he break in and take it all?

Does he still have a social security number? How did he get approved to rent an apartment without one?",ri7eum
hoxr0ko,"Interesting. I felt kind of the opposite about it.   


I will admit this is ripe for interesting stories going forward but I left the whole experienced feeling frustrated with Peter's character at the end of the movie. The movie kind of presented it as if it was the big grown-up decision he made and great power, great etc etc. But I just sat there thinking two things:  


1. He promised Ned and MJ he would tell them and it was their choice to want to continue being a part of his life, and he is depriving them of that
2. Peter was talking to the other Spider-men during the end fight about the importance of team work, so I thought they'd go for the whole - it's important to have people you love in your life who you can look out for and who can look out for you - kind of angle. IMO Peter not telling MJ and Ned is a massive regression of his character and shows his hasn't grown in much of a meaningful way.  


I suppose the story going forward could be one about how Spiderman cannot survive alone and Peter Parker needs other people.",ri7eum

I think this is the opportunity to start from scratch and have him fulfill the college timeline/scientist role, meet Gwen and fall for her because he will feel alleviated from the ""burden"" of ruining MJ's life/opportunities. Then whatever happens to end his relationship with Gwen whether she dies or they end it for another reason. THEN he will try again with MJ and they re-meet finally while in college, following some of the events of the other timelines.",ri7eum
hovyd39,"I'm really hoping they do 3 trilogies with Tom.

Highschool, college and then adult life.

College would have Felicia/Black Cat as the primary female role taking MJ's place temporarily. But ultimately, she just isn't who Peter feels he's meant to be with.

And then let MJ return in the adult life trilogy as a surprise for that first movie's trailer at the end. This time as a red head and letting Tom's Peter Parker get his happy ending in the final film of his run.",ri7eum

Like, people have been asking for years when we're going to get Uncle Ben flashbacks/dialogue or when Peter is going to acknowledge his great responsibility line. Now the answer seems to be... it simply *hadn't happened yet*, and Aunt May is his ""Uncle Ben"" in this universe.

FFH had classic Iron Man villain Mysterio...wait...yea, it's pretty stupid to make Mysterio just another Iron Man movie villain (guy who gets wronged by Stark)

I‚Äôm really excited for the future movies here. But I know Sony will want to use this as an opportunity to build up their other movies within their Spideyverse. So I worry if they go too far in that direction we may see a drop in quality.",ri7eum

Then instead of getting a 3rd to redeem himself, they rebooted the franchise to make it work with Civil War.",ri7eum
hovn9xr,"For me, and as someone whose grown up with the original franchise, Tom really stole it for me.  His emotional moments and the acting he portrayed was incredible.  That rooftop scene where he's crying and being held by his friends, the anger on his face at the end, he really showed his acting chops.  For some reason, I didn't like Garfield as much, but it's just a matter of preference, he looks a bit goofy (This is also why I can't finish tick tick boom on Netflix), and they made him incredibly empathetic here compared to the other Spidermen.  I get him tearing up after saving MJ but he was also tearing up seeing Holland tearing up because he was remembering Ben's lesson for sure.",ri7eum
howj88z,Andrew getting to save MJ was a nice touch. I thought that was him in the trailer and my suspicions were confirmed.,ri7eum
howkptu,"I stand by my belief that Andrew Garfield perfectly encapsulates what Spider-Man should be. His movies were lackluster, but he is my Spider-Man. The awkward yet quippy humor, the charm, the self-doubt were all there and its those traits that makes his Spider-Man the most relatable and best, imo.",ri7eum
how11au,"I feel like Tobey definitely shoulda been ""Spiderman 1"".  He deserved that respect.",ri7eum
howfs0w,Andrew definitely stole the show for me. It was so heartwarming to see him back and just clearly excited to be back. I'd give anything to see his story continue because he's just so clearly in love with this world. He also seemed to be the most capable of action scenes which as a Tobey day oner was understable.,ri7eum
howne5w,"They all worked so well together. I have to say, afterwards I was left saying that Garfield deserves another Spiderman movie, he's got the role down perfectly.",ri7eum
hownv39,Andrew re-cemented that he's been my favorite Spider-man out of three. The dude got the shaft with ASM2 then being fired from the role. So damn happy he got to finish off on a high note.,ri7eum
hovyniz,"I always thought Andrew was a great spider-man and Toney was a great peter Parker, so I thought I was fitting that Andrew walked through the portal in costume, while Toney came dressed casual",ri7eum
how7k9w,"I agree, I was so happy to see Andrew back and you can tell how happy he was to be back, well I feel Toby's Spider-Man story can be closed and that was a good finishing point for him I really feel they need to bring Andrew back for something else and give him more story, you can tell how much he loves Spider-Man and he does a really good job honestly, the movies might not been the best but he did the best with what they gave him, I doubt it happened but I would love for him to get like a mini Disney plus series or something so he can get a little bit more spotty time and then have a definitive end to his story too

Also with the limited time they had a little arc with Andrew too, when he got there he wasn't in the best place and he had a little connection with his ""brothers""  and got some human contact which you can tell he hasn't had much of since he's Spider-Man all the time in his universe and you can tell being with them really helped him in the end, that I love you guys comment from him they put in as a joke but the way it was delivered was so genuine",ri7eum
hox09p7,[deleted],ri7eum
hovwexj,I hope they take this rehabilitation of Garfield Spider-Man to make him Sony‚Äôs Spider-Man and stop teasing a merger of their sub-par movies with the MCU,ri7eum

howbail,Andrew was the best Peter in the movie by so much. The dude brought so much good vibes with him and every scene with him was a treat.,ri7eum
howd6l8,"Agreed, not a wasted breathe. The scene talking about how he took out his rage after Gwen died, saving MJ, god damn he killed it.",ri7eum
howixwj,"I saw this in a mostly empty theatre (midday on a Wednesday) and yet still both Andrew and Tobey got a round of applause when they appeared.

That said, I kind of wish there was a round of applause for Charlie Cox, even if it was just a cameo.",ri7eum
how4qcz,He gave the constipated look,ri7eum

hox2o18,Yeah that look was so fucking good.,ri7eum
hovpvxa,"I avoided spoilers and leaks of them coming back, but i fully expected them to make an appearance after seeing the first trailer.  It would be too big of a missed opportunity if their villians showed up to then not have the Spider-Men make an appearance.  However,  I thought it would be a brief cameo at the end.",ri7eum
hovoftx,"Yeah I was on the /r/MarvelStudios sub and people were saying ‚ÄòAndrew saved MJ just like everyone expected‚Äô and I was so glad I don‚Äôt take part in that anymore. I want to experience those moments in theater, not reading them and being like ‚Äòoh yeah we were right.‚Äô",ri7eum
hovkjux,I envy you dude,ri7eum

hovlfu8,i went i pretty much blind other than seeing the trailers. it was so great experiencing this movie with no real knowledge of what was coming,ri7eum
hovoalz,I messed up and checked the Wikipedia page for the run time and saw Tobey but closed it and was like maybe old footage,ri7eum
hovn4df,Villains and all or just the Spideys? My girlfriend has no idea anyone was coming out since she didn‚Äôt watch any trailers.,ri7eum
hovns45,"After I saw ~~Doc Oc in Venom 2~~ (maybe I saw a trailer with him in it? Idk, too much marvel has happened in the last few months for me to keep track) I heard the rumors about Toby and Andrew coming back but refused to look into it to confirm it

I still screamed YESSSSS when Toby showed up. Thankfully the entire theater was cheering so I wasn't just 1 asshole yelling in the theater",ri7eum
hovzdq8,People are such shitheads with spoilers. Went on YouTube to look something up and on my recommended page was a clip of the May scene with the spoiler in the title. This was yesterday.,ri7eum
hoxnv2g,"Yep. I vaguely knew it was multiverse related before going in so I had my own suspicions, but I avoided all big spoilers and trailers and I am glad I did. I'm also glad I went fairly soon so some asshat didn't spoil me on a random Reddit comment.",ri7eum
hp7zdam,"Man, I only knew Molina was going to be in this so the whole movie legitimately caught me off guard. Thought James Franco might even pop up at some point and have pie.",ri7eum
hrvcmpr,Same here.  I didn't know shit.  It was great.  I don't need to see a trailer of the new spiderman to know I want to see it.  It's spiderman.  I see it.,ri7eum
how2tgl,Major major credit to Sony for avoiding spoilers in the trailers. The fans kept demanding more and I‚Äôm SO glad they didn‚Äôt give it away like they usually do.,ri7eum
how8gok,"Yep. I've only seen the first trailer to this. Religiously avoided all the subsequent ones, and I'm glad I did.",ri7eum

hp02c6u,Lucky bastard,ri7eum
hp0dtsx,"I‚Äôm the same way, only I get impatient and curious and read articles and information about the movie as it‚Äôs being made. I was fully aware of all the returning actors. My friend on the other hand hadn‚Äôt even seen a single frame from the film and had no idea. We used to watch the Rami movies together back in middle school and went to see both TASM films on opening day. It was so fun to watch his reaction as he slowly started to piece together how ambitious this movie was aiming to be.",ri7eum
hp97epf,I envy the living shit out of you.,ri7eum
hpb12wk,Sadly wasn't a surprise for me because of the leaks and just how much everyone on social media was hyping it up and expecting it to happen that i basically did too but at least I avoided all the trailers after the first one,ri7eum
hox0gy0,"Right there with you. I am so happy I didn‚Äôt see any of the trailers for this movie. The only one I knew about from memes was Doc Ock, and I wasn‚Äôt even 100% sure that was real. Everything was a surprise to me too and I wouldn‚Äôt have had it any other way.",ri7eum
hovlnld,i loved how self aware this movie was of the Spider man series.,ri7eum

hpdkykm,"And then Tobey giving him a pep talk, literally calling him amazing multiple times. So fucking sweet, from the OG to the poor dude stuck with the worst movies.",ri7eum

hpnjooo,"Which didn't make any sense. The Goblin couldn't fly. He didn't use his strength to push off the ceiling. He just jumped a little and threw him down. Without some weird mass altering powers, there should have no way he'd crash them through two floors.",ri7eum
hovyszi,Willem Dafoe's face completely switching gears was an amazing lead up. Man did it feel eery when Peter felt like something was wrong.,ri7eum

hoz4xpv,That shit was brutal.  Can‚Äôt even remember how many floors got slammed through.,ri7eum
hp19spg,"It's these moments of choreography set with ""the logic of the superpowers"" that make them so good. Watching super soldier Dafoe do insane kicks or Spiderman use the momentum of his swings for a bigger wallop. It's not just a man blasting through a building, or Shang Chi killing a dragon out of nowhere.",ri7eum
hp404n6,For me it was the context of the fight. Goblin corrupted the villains chance at morality. And the suspense building up with the spidey sense before it made the explosiveness of the fight way more enjoyable. Good stuff.,ri7eum
hp4q3w7,"That fight and the Doc Ock fight on the highway were incredible. You could actually follow the choreography. I was ultimately a bit let down by the climactic battle, but the plot pulled me through.",ri7eum

hovbkrl,Andrew sold that scene. You could tell how much that save meant to him.,ri7eum
hovdkgn,"So great to see the Andrew redemption story. Not overdone, but sold so well by him.",ri7eum
hovyjwg,"I agree!! For a moment there, I was genuinely scared MJ would keep falling. I felt like the tension was built up for ten years when Andrew caught her. I think I actually started happy crying",ri7eum
hoyd0jd,"You knew it had to happen. At the end of Amazing Spiderman 2, he dwelled on that moment for so long and beat himself up over how he could have done better to catch Gwen. I loved that it payed off for him.",ri7eum

hovpazs,I honestly can't think of a superhero movie ive enjoyed more than this.  So much fanservice...but fanservice done in such a perfect way that made sense every single time.  Legit loved every single moment of this movie.,ri7eum

hp0lzhp,"Feige and Pascal did a new interview with the New York Times and they said while nothing is set in stone yet in terms of what the future of the franchise looks like, they wanted to reassure fans that their relationship is great and they were not have to experience anything like what happened after FFH.

Marvel still gets to use Spider-Man in an upcoming MCU movie, too. Tom Rothman mentioned it at the premiere. Who knows when he‚Äôll pop up next.",ri7eum

It hit so many beats perfectly, and Andrew Garfield was a revelation for me in this movie.",ri7eum
hoxl1sz,">It was really smart how they set it up as MCU Spider-Man ""origin story"" and making everyone forget about him. If Disney-Sony deal doesn't work out they'd have a reason why Spider-Man is not in MCU anymore.

Spiderman is still in the MCU even after the spell, they just don't know it's Peter. We see this with Happy at the end. 
So it'd just be weird if all the heroes suddenly stopped working with him/asking about him, so I don't think it would work if this was the last movie.",ri7eum
hoxuj91,">If Disney-Sony deal doesn't work out they'd have a reason why Spider-Man is not in MCU anymore and Sony will have a new story arc on their hand. But I really hope they continue their partnership. 

I feel pretty confident that they're going to keep it going. Marvel Studios is doing an animated series based on Holland's Spider-Man and I don't think they'd do that if they were about to lose the character.

Does Doc go back to his moment of drowning, but is now good while he dies? Does he turn good mid-fight, confusing the fuck out of younger Tobey who didn‚Äôt go to the MCU yet? Did that happen with Goblin too, so Tobey just keeps running into villains who inexplicably turn good at the climax of their fights? Does good Norman try to stop Doc Oc from turning evil in advance?

hovoa4a,"nah there's a greater implication here...

the Spider-Men have basically undone so many timelines and fucked up the multiverse by doing this. right? like, it could lead to some kind of monkey's paw unfortunate consequences thing.

you now have one timeline at the end of Spider-Man 1 where Norman Osbourne survives. not only is he alive, he's a great man again. perhaps he takes Peter under his wing. things are great. Peter never had to learn that there are deadly consequences to his Spider-Manning. he decides to start a relationship with Mary Jane. unfortunate consequences.

another timeline where Electro stops fighting Spider-Man mid battle. Spider-Man doesn't have to withstand Electro's final blows. in fact, Max is there at Spider-Man's side when Goblin approaches. they stop him before he can harm Gwen, and that Spider-Man has no tragedy that night. but because he didn't have to save Gwen, when it's *his turn* to save MJ in another universe, he's not prepared.

While the film has some issues (I think it probably should have been 3 hours, the plot could have breathed a bit more), it's easily the most ambitious MCU movie besides Infinity War/Endgame, and the emotions hit like a truck if you've spent the last 20 years watching Spider-Man movies.

> You see, the mantra ""With great power comes great responsibility"" is a complete abstract, so amorphous in nature it can be applied to nearly anything. It can mean personal responsibility, financial responsibility, political responsibility, and so forth. At best, this guiding wisdom from Uncle Ben is an incomplete ideal that a young and impressionable Peter Parker took as absolute truth.

> The real truth is that while Spidey uses this jewel as dogma, it is really a situational kernel of guidance at best. No one can be responsible for all things at all times for all situations they have the power to affect. Can you imagine how interrupted and unmanageable our lives would be if we stopped for every stranded motorist? If we ran to console every crying child? If we rushed to the scene of every accident? We couldn't possibly have the time or energy required to attend to our own personal matters. How many friends and loved ones would we neglect in the process? How could we possibly keep a job we were constantly late to?

> And here's Peter Parker, actually attempting to live his life like that. It is noble, admirable, and utterly foolish. The advice from Uncle Ben was incomplete, and certainly he could not foresee the things that were to come for his nephew. It would have broken his heart to see Peter face so many self-inflicted hardships in an attempt to live up to this impossible ideal. Other heroes have drawn the line, made the distinction between their life in the cape and outside of it.

> Bruce Wayne IS Batman. He long ago put aside his personal wants and needs to fight a never ending battle. Captain America made himself a sentinel, became more ideal than man, and sacrificed much in the process. Spider-Man is stuck in this incomplete, pubescent middle ground, trying to be a hero both in and out of cape, in matters great and small. Whether its stopping Dr. Octopus from robbing a bank or traveling out of his way to pick up some milk for Aunt May, Peter tries to do the right thing, too often at the same time. He spreads himself so thin trying to do everything he can't do anything. His grades slip, his friendships become distant, his relationships fail.

> Uncle Ben was murdered before he could ever impart the second half of his wisdom.

> ""With great power comes great responsibility, and with great responsibility comes great sacrifice.""

> If Spider-Man is the embodiment of Ben's sentiment, there can be no Peter Parker. He must choose one or the other, but not both. Peter never learned that and no one seems to have the heart to tell him; so he battles on; a boy still chasing an ideal he's not mature enough to comprehend - still clinging to the last words of someone he loved; still mourning someone he lost.",ri7eum

I'm really glad for Garfield to have gotten a fair shake with this movie. As much as I didn't like his films or portrayal, you could never say he didn't have a childlike wonder of getting to play Spider-Man.

For infinity war, it was the pure scale and shock of having the bad actually win for once (not for long, of course). 

For this movie, it was the way it simultaneously gave closure to *three* separate franchises in meaningful ways that didn't seem ham fisted at all. Of all the sci Fi media to utilize the concept of the multiverse, this one felt the most real. Like the audience was also part of the same multiverse.

Like are you dumb May, you‚Äôre not the one having to fight everyone when things go to shit, like Doctor Strange said, they have their own fates and Peter wasn‚Äôt responsible for that. Though I have always found this Aunt May to be annoying.",ri7eum
hp2yqz9,"I actually kinda agree. Its weird coz i know he will leave may to her ""Fate"" but when Strange tells him its the fate of these people from OTHER UNIVERSES he hass issues with it? Also messing with unknown powers much. What if something worse happens during the time it takes to fix the villains instead of insta sending them back.",ri7eum
hqhrk5o,"I was also annoyed by this. I didn't appreciate how they tried to romanticize trying to ""fix"" or ""change"" psychopathic narcissistic killers. That's not something we should aspire to do in real life, because it doesn't work that way. Some people are just not redeemable and don't deserve ""second chances"". But then again I have to remember (and I hope others do too) that this is a fictional movie and they had technology that doesn't exist bla bla.

hovg573,It‚Äôs my #1 MCU film easily. I don‚Äôt even have to question it,ri7eum
hovv5uf,What this movie was able to achieve had the underpinnings of deep nostalgia that was rooted nearly 3 decades ago. This type of film product is practically impossible to replicate. There‚Äôs no understating the unique emotional effect this movie has on fans of the character over this time. That takes this movie beyond so much. It‚Äôll never be repeated. Felt like child me met adult me and it was perfect.,ri7eum
hovlyjl,"Obviously, recency bias, but this was 100% my favorite mcu movie",ri7eum
hovo0s6,Easily better than Infinity War and Endgame IMO.  This is probably by far my favorite MCU movie just out of pure fun and enjoyment alone.  Not a single second moment felt like it was wasted.,ri7eum
hovwac0,It's perfectly fine to have a bigger reaction to this than the last two Avengers. This is definitely up there with those as this multi year buildup of pure fan service along with great stories.,ri7eum
howsd15,"Honestly, I was thinking the exact same thing. This _was_ the Avengers (or at least the Civil War) of the Spider-Man films. Enormously stacked cast, huge plot and tons of fights and interactions between all the different characters, all handled in a very competent and heartfelt way. I can't really decide which I like more, but I wonder if, as a _film_, this one might actually be the #1 MCU film of them all at this point. It was just so _perfect_.",ri7eum
hozd5s3,"Dude, I agree whole heartedly. Infinity war and End game are fun movies, End game being more spectacle than movie imo. This film however cuts to the core of who and what spider man is, how no matter the universe Peter is Peter. Endgame made me feel like kid again, giddy and just overloaded with joy, for about twenty collective minutes. No way home on the other hand made me feel like the same kid I was watching Spider man 2 in theaters again. From the moment Molina showed up I was mystified, balled my eyes out at three separate scenes, and utterly taken in by this movie. Is it perfect? No, but it‚Äôs legitimately something special.",ri7eum
hovruet,"Its up there for me along with infinity war. Idk infinity war had more of that ""oh shit"" feeling throughout the movie. This one is awesome but it's mostly Peter (one) fucking shit up the entire movie lol.",ri7eum
hoxkh6i,"Absolutely to me. I feel like NWH told a more focused and cohesive story. Despite the many elements, it's very much a movie about Tom Holland's Peter Parker. Endgame is a celebration of the MCU and the Avengers, Infinity War was Thanos' story with the ""extras"" but this, Tom deserves so much credit for his acting here",ri7eum
hp093u7,"I'd argue they're different, but I actually felt more watching this than I did watching Tony pass after the final snap.",ri7eum

hp4d06j,"Everyone has their opinions :] 

It's my favorite MCU movie right behind end game. But mostly because I think Andrew was the best spiderman who was surrounded by shitty directors and writing. I have nothing against Tom Holland. He is a great actor in his own rights. I just think Andrew nails the personality of the spiderman I grew up knowing.",ri7eum
hpdi9d9,"It is absolutely my #1 Marvel film by a MILE.

I feel confident in saying there will never be another film that manages a nostalgia bomb like this for millennials again. I still remember the trailer with the twin towers in it for SM1. My entire life flashed before my eyes watching this film.",ri7eum
hoxcloq,Absolutely. I'm not a fan of the Avengers movies in general but this immediately leaped into my top movies of all time (Into the Spider-Verse still takes the top spot for favourite Spider-Man movie for me though!).,ri7eum
hox4q93,"Unpopular opinion, I hated Endgame. It was the first and only time I‚Äôd ever walked out of a MCU movie and wished I could get my money and time back. On the other hand I paid double for motion 4D seats for NWM and it was worth every cent",ri7eum
hp4qpi4,This was a better movie overall then IW or Endgame. Don't feel bad about it. This was an AWESOME movie.,ri7eum
hs04fd0,"I don't know if better but I have Infinity War, Avengers 1, GoTG 1 and Iron Man 1 up in the top tier and No Way Home just joined them",ri7eum
hovpx7b,"Eddie got pulled in is because in the second Venom movie, the symbiotes share a hive mind that perhaps transcends the multiverse, and so if any Venoms knew Peter Parker, all Venoms knew him. Also I haven't watched Spiderman 3 in years but maybe that Venom knew?",ri7eum
howwocx,"One wrong point: The final spell was to make everyone in MCU forgets that Peter Parker exists, NOT Spider-Man (as JJ's latest news shows). So technically, Spider-Man is still known as an Avenger who fought Thanos.",ri7eum
howuyzl,The Rogers: The Musical poster makes a lot of sense because this movie takes place shortly before Hawkeye.,ri7eum
hoxl0ey,"I could be wrong, but I kind of remember Tom Holland saying he wants to be the Marty McFly for this generation.",ri7eum
howjcy6,"At the end of Venom two he say the news cast that Peter Parker is Spiderman, so he is someone who knows. Additionally that is why he teleported in that post credit sequence. I am sad probably no Tom Holland Tom Hardy movie, but the symbiote staying makes me excited for a more 'gritty' Tom Holland spiderman as seeing him in Devil All The Time makes me think it would 100% work, he's not just a fluffy actor he can do other bits.",ri7eum
howbw7b,"YES YES YES!! I agree so much! I hated MCU Spiderman for a while because of how un-Peter Parker it was. Like Holland was just given everything on a silver platter. The Peter Parker-esque struggle that made him so relatable is back. Saving this comment so I can award this later

howi4nw,I was almost the same as you when Spider-Man came out in 2002. I still remember cutting the Spider-Man picture from the first time I saw the movie poster in the newspaper and I looked at it for months till I saw this movie. For me the best part was Tobey. Glad he wasn't altered to be quick-witted or smart as MCU heroes. He is still the same good-hearted kind guy. Nothing has changed him over maybe 20 years he's operating as Spider-Man. He still feels everyone's pain and is still optimistic no matter how bad things are. It was like meeting my old hero from childhood.,ri7eum

howc9t1,"The whole point was that so long as they know him, they won‚Äôt ever be safe. The only measure left would be for him to voluntarily distance himself, in order to protect them.

It‚Äôs a bitter-sweet Peter Parker-esque ending",ri7eum

hovb5lq,">Ultimately is a good movie in part because of all the callbacks/nostalgia/etc. But the movie is smart enough to use callbacks in service of the story, and not as a substitute for the lack of a story. It's why this fan service works here and doesn't in so many other movies.

I think it's because they built the story around the fan service and callbacks minus a few meme lines here and there. The overall plot and story is messy as shit but it still works because they built it on something mostly solid. Most stories that do callbacks or fan service just throw them in there randomly that has absolutely zero point other than being a callback or reference for the fans to clap to",ri7eum

There needed to be more between Maguire and Defoe.  Not a whole scene, just a few more lines acknowledging that Norman Osborne was back and he was going home to his son (or *something*).

Andrew Garfield got his moment when he saved MJ and in some way made up for failing to save Gwen, and his conversation with Electro after he'd been cured.  I never got that feeling with Maguire and Defoe unfortunately.

I also don't feel there was any real need to rush that either.  My favourite thing about Endgame for example was the time taken to give everybody a proper send off, whether it was a final goodbye or just sending them off on their next adventure.  Tony snapped his finger at the two hour 30 minute mark and thus ended the big epic final battle, but the movie goes on for another 20 minutes (before credits).

While I do think Dr. Strange rushed the beginning spell too much (and therefore has most of the blame of the spell going wrong, I mean he didnt even explain what he was doing before he did it), I do think that was in character for him. He‚Äôs not a patient man, despite being a doctor.

slight disagreement here; I didn't think he really added anything.

""the villain whose kind of on Peter's side"" role already felt filled by Otto. It's also confusing because the unifying aspect of all the villains is that they hate Peter, get obsessed with killing him, and ultimately die trying. Except Marko not only survived his movie, he reconciled with Peter too! They even reference that here so if you didn't see Spider-Man 3 you'd be even more confused. I guess they need to send him back too to see his daughter, but why ""fix him""? Why is he teaming up with the bad guys?

> Logically they're still going to be dead when they go back so whats the point? It's not like theyre going back to a universe they were dead in to suddenly be around again.

An easily-overlooked detail in their dialogue is that they were all transported shortly *before* they died. Also, they all died at least partially by their own actions. So if they're ""cured"" and sent back, they wouldn't have died. It's not air-tight reasoning by any means but it works for a Marvel movie.",ri7eum

hp5mp3r,Yeah that's my nitpick. Not entirely sure how the spell functions. Like yeah it brainwashed people but did Ned and MJ just wake up on in the aftermath of the battle and have no questions? Surely the news coverage of Peter Parker being Spiderman would have been all over social media.,ri7eum
hp62aju,There's not really a good explanation cos the movie is typical marvel trash but the explanation is that spiderman told strange to do the forgetting spell but cos the movie is stupid strange didn't actually explain the spell properly and spider didn't care to ask a lot of questions about it so midway through the spell he told strange to keep changing the spell so that important people didn't forget (it was really important for him that MJ and his best friend remember him). This messes up the spell and throughout the movie spiderman comes to terms with the fact that he needs the important people to forget him to save the world and for them to live their lives without spiderman causing them pain so he tells strange to make everyone forget him like the initial spell and this completes the spell and fixes everything.,ri7eum
hp7fyx1,"The spell was everyone who knows Peter Parker is Spiderman should still remember. Since he modified the spell so many times, it ruined it, altering reality.

Spiderverse has a better payoff then NWH, easily. Each of the Spider-people giving their story to Miles was such a great moment that NHW barely even touched the surface of. I love Andrew and Tobey but they never really felt like they either passed the torch or justified their existence. The whole movie just sorta feels like an excuse to do a Live action Spiderverse movie but without the story to back it up.

EDIT: This movie had plenty of retcons even if not all of them directly. There is no world where the writing in this movie properly represents the characters from their movies.

hpxtcdp,"Fully agreed. Indeed the weak point of this movie was probably the entire first 1/3, which was the setup for Peter's motivations, mostly driven by aunt May trying to help everyone.

  


Nonetheless, Peter's motivation in this movie ranged from dumb to full on irrational. Why would Peter try to wipe memories after seeing what tampering with time and space would do in the infinity saga? Why was he acting like a 7 year old with ADHD while Dr Strange casted a life changing spell with incredible repercussions? Why would aunt may insist on saving supervillains she doesn't know, at expense of her and other civilian lives, just to prove a very vague moral point?

ht5ipsg,"Can't believe how far I have to scroll to find a negative comment.


Poorly written, cringe dialogue (especially by some of the villains), inclusion of Ned/MJ is completely pointless and annoying for most parts of the story, and both the beginning (the fact that the spell got screwed up like that just seems so unbelievable, there was no discussion on what Peter actually wanted to do - it just happened immediately, Strange keeps saying not to disturb him while he's doing it, and Peter keeps disturbing him anyway...) and ending are just dumb. They spent 2 whole movies building up Spider man with all this Stark tech that he's barely even an actual spiderman, only to retcon that by the end of NWH, make everyone forget who Peter is, so my assumption is the next movie will be Peter actually becoming a ""friendly neighbourhood spiderman"". 


Only redeeming factors of this movie are Garfield, Dafoe, Molina, and Maguire. Nice to see all the spiderman work together but I guess they thought they didn't need to write an actual story since people would be too caught up in the whole spectacle of 3 spider men.


It's nice that people liked it (I enjoyed the nostalgic aspects as well and always nice to see more of Garfield's spiderman) and all but there are many comments saying it's up there with the Dark Knight and is a ""masterpiece"", which is just ridiculous to me.",ri7eum

I like the concept, bringing together the 3 series, but I‚Äôm not happy with the way they did it. Tobey and Andrew were WAY too chill about crossing into a new universe, and were weirdly wise beyond their years.   

And I‚Äôm not super happy with the final fight either. None of the villains had to come to any realization about their flaws or move past their wrongdoings or anything, just ‚Äústab them with this syringe and they‚Äôre healed‚Äù. Felt like a really easy copout.  

There were definitely some really good powerful moments in the film, but overall I felt they really underused the multiverse thing and could‚Äôve done something better.

how4fv3,"Well, they are super geniuses.",ri7eum
hp07elj,Yeah to a degree it‚Äôs silly but the movie did show they had several damaged cure devices from Stark‚Äôs machine already in hand. They basically had to re-do the work that had already been done. In andrew‚Äôs case he had already made the formula for lizard,ri7eum

Also, It was implied Peter was pulling his punches in round 1 vs goblin. Round 2 he didn‚Äôt, which was shown when he dented the steel with his fist.

How does forgetful spell relate to digital storage? Is it a perception filter kind of thing?

hozukf9,I think it‚Äôs supposed to be this Peter Parker with the memory. The point of origin kinda thingb,ri7eum
hozuk8i,"I've been thinking there's basically two routes this could go. 

1. Endgame time travel logic means everyone goes back to where they were. The two spidermen go to their respective universes completely unchanged, and the reformed villains end up in seperate alternate timelines. Potentially the effects of the spell might still retcon some things in any of those universes, but hard to say. 

2. The spell isn't technically time travel and may change these universes on some fundamental level. Meaning they can ignore the endgame logic, and the two spidermen are now with the reformed villains in their respective universes. Potentially retconning pieces of these universes in a way where sony can pick and choose if they decide to revisit these characters as seperate Spiderman series. So we could have happier timelines with Harry Osborn or Gwen Stacy still around, or we could end up with some dystopian mess. 

Sony has been awkwardly trying to build a shared Spiderman based universe for years, and potentially could do that through more of a spiderverse with Andrew and Tobey. Really interesting to see what they try to do in the next few years.",ri7eum
hp9pg6r,"In my opinion, Norman being cured doesn't actually change too much with respect to Spider-Man 2, especially if a remorseful Norman turns himself in for Green Goblin's crimes. Harry would still have to take over the business and seek to restore his family's good name. So Otto's accident would likely still happen. The biggest difference would be how much Peter's arc changes. While he may still feel the struggle of balancing his two lives, he wouldn't necessarily have the trauma of Norman's death nor Harry's burning hatred for Spider-Man causing him to sink further into existential dread.

I think it allows for a nice compromise to have marvel keep Tom Holland in the mcu where he can team up with other heroes and sony can push miles as the next original version of spiderman that does strictly spiderman stuff

General audiences have been getting the multiverse shoved down our throats with everything marvel related for the last 2 years so by the time we get the next ""avengers"" style mega movie, people won't be scratching their heads in the theater",ri7eum

Garfield Spidey was teleported in his uniform, while Tobey was teleported wearing civilian clothing. So Garfield was probably laying low while everything happened, and Tobey just walked around trying to get his bearings on where he was, and presumably *saw* the TV reports with Peter, MJ and Ned's faces plastered all over (or researched this other Peter through the internet, and found out about them.)

Heck, Garfield-Spidey basically made a gag about him being in a different universe with nothing but the uniform. When Ned brings him over to his grandma's house, he mentions not being able to show an ID to prove he's also a Peter Parker.",ri7eum
hp3jem8,"From what i gather, Tobey- Spidey knew that Garfield wasn't their Peter because Tom-Spidey's face had been splashed all across tv and billboards. Ned and MJ faces have been right beside him.

There was also a trip to the Caribbean for scuba diving that some people did. I think other clubs like the German club went to Germany.

hraw9y2,"More so, and harder to follow because there's even more titles for just one character. MCU is way easier to follow compared to the comics.

hpc52cl,"Your opinion is solid. The shitty jokes killed the movie for me. It ruined emotional scenes, stopped the momentum during the action parts, etc.  Every joke is told twice or even THREE times to be sure the dumbfucks loudly swallowing pop corn could get them.

The MCU is great at threading together continuous storylines between a wide cast of characters, but the plots usually don‚Äôt hold up under scrutiny and the dialogue can get extremely cringy. Tonally, these movies tend to be all over the place. This one definitely was.

I actually think Willem Dafoe seemed like the least invested actor in the movie, even though he's the best actor out of the bunch BY FAR. They even got a fairly decent performance out of Toby Macguire, which is a borderline oxymoron.

The story though SUCKED ASS. Started off with a decent world bending premise with a bit of fan service, which descended into a pure, shameless, unadulterated nostalgia nuke. 

How crap like this keeps getting rave reviews is beyond me. It's like The Force Awakens, except the Spiderman movies are NOTHING compared to Star Wars' legacy. Everyone RAVED about the new Star Wars when it came out, but it didn't take long before the rose-tinted glasses faded (though The Last Jedi didn't help, despite ALSO getting rave reviews).",ri7eum

But my god as a movie it just felt so weak and idk if I'm just getting tired of all the marvel stuff but the dialogue felt awful at times.

It really felt like a shitty kids movie when Peter and Doctor strange were interacting and he gets angry and pulls the whole ""call me sir"". Just so heavy handed.

The plot as a whole as well when you break it down somehow a bunch happened while at the same time nothing did, the locations were pretty boring.

Also something I don't see people mention is something that really dissapointed me. After the cliffhanger in far from home I was so excited to see how this would change the status quo. I've never seen a piece of spiderman media where his identity is revealed, it was really interesting to see at the start with how his classmates treated him etc. But after the villains show up it's basically never brought up again in an interesting way.

I feel like once the hype dies down on a rewatch this is gonna be one of my least favourite spiderman movies which is such a shame. At least we get more spider verse though",ri7eum

- create a good movie giving reason to three generations of Spider Man being on the screen at the same time

It closes what's the weakest part of the movie for me which started when he decides to take the cube from Dr. Strange. I get that it's a superhero film and that you probably shouldn't think too hard about some things if you want to have fun but that stretch was extremely rough. When he's at Happy's place with all these supervillains it's very much a ""come on, what are we doing here"" situation. There's similar things all over the movie (how tf do you develop a cure for all these guys in 3 hours with supplies from a school lab) but in that stretch they're the most apparent IMO and the characters motivations are the least believable. Also after that you get the nice benefit of nostalgia filling in a lot of the cracks.

Look up Roger Ebert's definition of this to see how it clearly applies here.

I don't think rehashing Spider-Man 3's ""forgive the killer"" plot was the best idea. That was not the greatest storytelling moment for Spider-Man.

Demoting Spider-Man back to a neighborhood guy is important. That's who the character is. He can be whisked away to fight on another world, but he has to come back home. And even in the comics, the other heroes never knew his identity, with rare exceptions. Just teaching him to keep it secret is an improvement.

Take the 'Martha' beat. That was made fun of cause it was in a knockout drag out fight and then it gets stopped by a 'Save Martha' and their mom's names happening to be the same.

Now compare that to ""great power comes great responsiblity."" It is in a quiet moment of pain, that all three of them bond over. And they're not at odds. They just share the pain.

Flint and Max have diametrically different goals. Max wants to destroy the box and stay. While Flint wants to just press the damn thing and go home to his kid. Flint stands down until things go tits up and he's done with this place. Self centered short sighted choices might not be great but it is part of his characterization carried over from the movies.

And you might not like their motivations, but they're not completely shit performances like BvS Lex. They actually managed to improve on Electro from his previous outing. 

Beat for beat this was way better than BvS. If you don't see that, you're being effected just as much by your own bias as you think others are when the critique the early DCEU.

hp35m2e,"I so agree, and this is coming from an MCU fanboy who enjoyed Tom Holland's films. For me, this movie tried too much to be a cultivation of every Spidey film before it. Which was awesome but also it's downfall. See, the thing is - Holland hasn't been set up with his relationships among his loved ones. We skipped the nuances of his and Mays relationship, showing her to be this cool aunt and yet where is the heart in it? Homecoming had one scene where she scolded him. Then nothing. We're told she had a huge issue with him being Spiderman but to show that is just asking too much I guess. Her death would have meant more should we have seen her acting the role of optimistic. Hell, in Homecoming again she seemed adamant in Peter staying out of fights. But no, we'll just assume the Goblin is right about her role in Peter's life because he obviously knows her the best after a single day. Her death should have been Peter's doing, as in - he should have decided to help the villains on his own accord. Maybe he holds regret for Mysterio, maybe even after all that he's fucked up the fact that he couldn't save Beck is the reason he wants to try to help these villains. But it comes with a cost, and Aunt Mays spiel should have been her trying to teach him that he had to take into account consequences of every action no matter how noble. She helps him to save them because she'd do anything for her nephew. Hell, she's already sacrificed so much for him and that should have been Peter's catalyst to go to Strange. He realizes the strain that's been placed on the one person who hasn't left him. He wants better for May, so he goes to the only man who may understand and may be able to help.
Let his actions be selfless and for family, not his friends. Or, if they must, let them be the after thought and not her.  May should have been at focus here. But let's also not negate the fact that the same can be said for Mj. Peter and her are together for what reasons in this iteration? I haven't a clue. We're told they're in love, but I didn't see the scene where Mj realizes Peter can give her something that her abusive household can't. I didn't see the scene for she looks at Peter, standing tall and against his bullies just to help out a fellow victim. Oh, wait. That happened in the other Spidermen films. In our version, she likes him cause he's cute I guess?
And he simply had a crush on her since forever, sees the goodness behind the shallow facade of her friends. He idolizes her smarts, and how she is able to cool down Flash by her wits. Oh, wait...wrong films again. Idk, maybe he likes her because she looks like Zendaya?
Who knows.
All I can say is that the saving grace of this film is the past characters from the other versions. Because those movies did well in getting us to care about what they stood for and who they were in contrast to their loved ones. The MCU simply forgot to get us to care for these characters because they relied on past iterations to fill in the blanks for us.",ri7eum

I don't completely get the Aunt May role because we never got significant interactions between them save for one or two minor scenes. They try their damn hardest to make these characters work and give them these big send offs, but they haven't been earned yet.
You want me to care for Aunt May? Let me see her as the mother figure in his life. Why allude to a drift between her and Peter for him being Spiderman and not show us that? Why have Mj drop the love bomb when all I've seen is her falling for Peter because he's cute? (Because I still haven't the faintest clue as to why this iteration of Mj likes Peter... And especially, vice versa). Mj literally had to ask Peter what he liked about her in this film, and if that isn't the laziest attempt to give depth to them then...well, it's shit writing.

But of course, to understand *Civil War*, first I had to watch all the previous *Avengers* and *Iron Man* movies too, because Tony Stark is also very relevant in the *Spider-Man* movies.
 
Then, when I started watching the second *Spider-Man* movie, I suddenly found out that Iron Man was dead and realised that I also had to watch all the other *Avengers* movies after *Civil War* to understand that *Spider-Man* movie, because apparently it didn't continue where the previous one ended, but instead where *Endgame* ended.
 
So I had to watch *Infinity War* and *Endgame* too. But I had no idea why Thor and Loki were fighting Thanos at the beginning of *Infinity War*, because I hadn't watched the other *Thor* movies after the first one. I had also only watched the first *Guardians of the Galaxy* movie, and I hadn't watched any of the *Dr Strange*, *Black Widow*, *Black Panther*, etc. etc. etc. movies that I just wasn't interested in.

Jeff Bridges in iron man 1, Corey Stoll in ant-man, Mads Mikkelsen in Doctor Strange, Michael B Jordan in black Panther(good character but basically evil black Panther).

that it was kinda disappointing. I saw the trailer like once and you knew immediately that Garfield would be the Spider-Man to save MJ. I‚Äôm not a comics-reader at all and there were just too many things that were meta and on the nose that ultimately made the movie kinda shallow. I did like the idea of having the Spidermen cure the villains and there were some genuinely emotional moments in the movie (like Peter being happy that MJ and Ned get into MIT at the end).

hp5toe0,"Part 2  
  
\>! So phase 4 is slowly becoming my least favourite phase. As I said, this was my most anticipated movie and although it was good, I see it slipping. Where this had the opportunity to be one of the to films they made. I can say that there is a lot to say about Shang-Chi and I need to watch the Eternals another time. Dr Strange has so much hope as it will definitely be fresh, new, and crazy enough to capture audiences.  
  
My nitpicks:  
  
\>! So Tom goes to Strange to ask him to cast a spell so everyone forgets Peter is Spider-Man. Strange is clearly fine with this in the beginning, even coming up with the idea himself after being reminded that he cast it on Wong before. So this is all fine. Until Tom breaks the spell.  
Ok, as a storyline it works. But then at the end. Tom goes to Strange on the Statue of Liberty and says. Just do it, I want everyone to forget Peter Parker. And Strange reacts like he‚Äôs losing his oldest and best friend, tearing up. Are we going round in circles here?! What makes it worse is somehow Strange actually cares about Peter‚Äôs choice now. Not that the spell might backfire, but he clearly only cares that he will forget Peter Parker. Come on..? Why?  
  
\>! Then there is just the fact that Tom is trying pointlessly to save/reform these villains. How does he know that curing them and sending them back will save them. They appeared here just before they died. They are going back reformed, appearing moments before their death, to still die. Except this time, they are probably scared and completely aware to what‚Äôs about to happen. Great.  
  
\>! Andrew and Tobey know that all of their villains have been reformed. But they are going back to their specific time in their universes. Both going back years after their villains are dead. Their past selves are still going to kill/cause the villains deaths regardless of what they‚Äôve all seen.  
  
\>! Then Ned all of a sudden, with no training can open portals. Where in Dr Strange, it took him a good while, even when he was fighting for his life. Also, in Kamar Taj, we see students training with their sling rings. Ned makes this look so much easier than these people. Who by all accounts are basically equivalent to Shaolin Monks.  
  
\>! So Tom is now a master of the Astral Plane? Is this because of his Spider-Sense? How he can dodge Dr Strange as he tries to take the cube, and this is at high speeds, as Spider-Mans limp body is falling in slow motion this whole time. Then he can ‚Äòswim‚Äô back into his body? How?  
  
\>! Why is Electro there if he doesn‚Äôt know Peter Parker is Spider-Man?!  
  
\>! Half way through the main fight. The 3 spiders just stop fighting to stand and talk for literally over 2 minutes! Lizard is slightly trapped under some scaffolding, but Sandman and Electro and doing NOTHING this whole time. While they are joking around about what the Avengers is, is it a band?! And who is what Peter. Then the ‚ÄúI love you guys‚Äù and ‚Äúthank you‚Äù line. YOU‚ÄôRE IN A HUGE FIGHT DUDES.. maybe focus on that. I‚Äôm just trying to imagine Electro to the side, just hovering there, like some video game character waiting for you to finally engage, so his animation will start.  
  
\>! So, are we completely forgetting Tom‚Äôs paraphrased ‚ÄúWith great power, comes great responsibility‚Äù line from Homecoming. Where he says ‚ÄúWhen you can do the things that I can, but you don‚Äôt, and then the bad things happen, they happen because of you.‚Äù. Because he definitely said that before..?  
  
Then we come onto tv tropes.  
  
Namely;  
  
* Women in Refrigerators: May.   
* Bechdel Test: I don‚Äôt think this passes.   
* Misunderstanding trope: (this is not what it looks like) very funny when Happy and May walk in to Tom and MJ with Tom stripped to his undies saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do..!‚Äù  
* Ned‚Äôs lines are ONLY used as a cheap fan stand-in. All of his scenes are clearly for this purpose. His shock and excitement when Strange mentions the Undercroft? Or saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm in the Sanctum Sanctorum!‚Äù. What actual meaningful lines does he actually get throughout the whole trilogy? He also has taken the mantle of stereotypical token best friend for this whole trilogy with no arc at all.   
  

TLDR: 

No way home was a great story, but all the fan service is making me realise more and more how stale the McU is becoming. They are killing it with their Disney+ shows, but I honestly think phase 3 was the peak of the McU. This was great as a Reddit-meme/reference movie at the end of the day, as it feels like a fan edited trailer from YouTube in 2018. I am deeply disappointed.

I honestly think Strange shouldn't have been apart of this movie, which is weird to say. Mcu Spider-Man has yet to have a solo movie. First overshadowed by Iron man then by magic and Doctor Strange. Unless someone wants to correct my knowledge of the comic or the shows, but I think the multiversal stuff all existed through technology. 

I don't know if the MCU went with magic because of Into the Spiderverse or if they just wanted to do their own version but it felt like a knockoff in a way. To be similar but distinct.

They gave fans what they wanted while also making the movie stand on its own. 

It‚Äôs the best Spiderman origin film to date. 

The fan service is all but empty. I genuinely felt like a kid again. 

I watched it a second time last night with the fam and it still holds up well. My mom who hasn‚Äôt watched any avengers or mcu movies in general loved it. 

There‚Äôs a lot of heart in this movie thanks to Tom holland, zendaya, and Ned. 

Andrew and tobey are just the icing on the cake so to say this fan service is empty is a massive understatement imo. 

Tobey could‚Äôve only appeared for a second like for the scene where Tom talks about mays last words being ‚Äúgreat power comes great responsibility‚Äù and Tobeys eyes are wide open as he realizes it‚Äôs the same as with his uncle Ben. 

Like that could‚Äôve been the only scene we got with tobey and it would‚Äôve still been amazing.

hphcxuz,"Just got back from the cinema and sorted by controversial to find this - Couldn't agree more. 

The film was just off throughout. It felt to me as a casual watcher of the MCU like it needed another few passes of serious editing. 

The plot was weird, unbelievable throughout and just came across as lazy. The dialogue was in parts laughably Bad and about 1/3 of the scenes seemed essentially meaningless In regards to the overall storyline. The 'Jokes' also, oh man, so bad. Barely a chuckle in our packed cinema. 

I think that 2minute sequence of nonsense discussion in the scaffolding while the two very mobile badguys presumably just wait patiently summed it up for me. I mean, how do you not see that when making a film and go - Yeah guys, that doesn't quite make sense ey. The dialogue wasn't even funny or particularly useful to advancing the story, could it not have been a quick 'we need to work together, follow my lead' type thing instead? Maybe I'm missing something here. 

The fights however I did enjoy and a few of the emotional moments landed. I liked how they tied up the stories of Maguire and Whatshisface, but felt cheated when Toby magically is absolutely fine after having his spine severed.. if you're gonna do that surely he has to die right ? 

Ah well, horses for courses I suppose. Not for me. Glad to see I'm  not completely alone out here.

May's death is there as a teaching point for spiderman. He didn't lose anyone yet directly because of his actions until this point.

The whole spell and what not is his fault.

You can see that at the end as he backs off from his best friends and just happy for them to be alive and well.

That's the growing up he needed the whole time to realize his actions have consequences. He was still very much a kid who does silly mistakes for the past 2 movies and the first half of this one.

Like going to ask strange to undo it all so he can get into MIT instead of calling for example.

From Strange's perspective this was a simple spell. Just make everyone forget. He didn't even fathom that it could literally break the universe. Just him trying to help a kid out when he's over his head with the identity reveal.

Tobey and Garfield both got closure as well as all the villains.. this movie literally fixed and got a closure for all the previous movies. It's insane they managed to even pull that so well.

That sound of amazement and bewilderment of Tobey, he really wanted Tom to go into detail more.",ri7eum
hp6oi9y,"Without getting super convoluted, i see it like this:

We have no idea where Strange used the spell to send them back. It‚Äôs possible since Peter went through all of this and did it, he sends them all back at a point before the villains are passed the point of no return in their demise to give them a fighting chance.

So for Ock, perhaps Strange sends him back before the machine destabilizes and he pulls it into the water. Since Ock is redeemed, he won‚Äôt attempt the machine. For Electro, he will be depowered, so he will just leave the electric plant. For Norman, he will not attempt to fly the glider into Tobey and end their fight and go home to Harry or answer to his crimes.

Plus, these are the same Spidey‚Äôs they fought. Now that these Spidey‚Äôs have memories of this experience, perhaps their ‚Äúyounger‚Äù selves at the points the villains die will try harder to avoid their fates and help as much as possible.",ri7eum
hp81hb3,Did Ock keep the stark tech?,ri7eum
hp9r77m,"It isn't actually pulling them from the moments of their death but rather the periods of time after which they knew Peter was Spider-Man. For Doc Ock that means the handful of minutes before he died and for Electro that means right as he was about to die (as he was absorbing all that data). So if you were to ask me, Doc Ock will possibly still die as the machine still needs to be drowned in the river. But Electro should be fine because he can no longer absorb the data/energy and overload.

For Lizard that means after the sewers and before he is cured. So it is possible he doesn't even have time to attack Peter's school. For Sandman it likely occurs some time after Spider-Man 3 (as I don't remember him learning it in the film) as his greeting when he first appeared implies time would have passed that he would need to remind Peter/Spider-Man who he was. For Norman it would happen sometime after Thanksgiving but before the final fight because his gear is in relatively pristine condition.

The villains and heroes only ASSUME that everyone was pulled right before they died because it is determined that Ock, Electro, and Norman all died and Ock and Electro were clearly pulled from moments before their death.",ri7eum

Still, he's effectively just continuing the line of thinking that Tony himself sided with in Civil War. And considering that the movie is built around the entire multiverse getting screwed up because a high school kid asks his wizard buddy to fix a problem for him by ""brainwashing the planet"" instead of picking up the phone... is he really wrong?

Not surprising? I would've *never* guessed that the third movie in the series was actually Spidermans origin story.

Story was tight. It actually managed to give a reason and individual motivation for almost each villains actions and they're all different (lizard only one without clear motivation) . That's very hard to pull off. Each villain wanted the cube for a different reason.

hp9qzl8,I feel like the MCU Spiderman movies tried doing 2 things but never did them successfully IMO.

Green Goblin had no coherent motivations in his original movie. He was a crazy maniac there too, lol. Sure, he wanted revenge on the people who wronged him, but after that, he had no plans other than to fuck with people for the hell of it.

But even without the strange lighting, the movie looked extremely bland. The camera and cinematography were all bad even for an MCU movie, which are often criticized for blandness. The only interesting shot I remember somewhat liking was in the final battle, where they match cut (?) the three Spider-Man's faces getting ready to fight. 

It's incomparable to the Raimi movies which had an amazing visual flair to them. Watts is pretty good at shooting the character and comedic moments but he has no visual style and it really hurts the movies.",ri7eum

You could argue that the whole plan stemming from him giving up the time stone was equally contrived, if not more so.

Then in hindsight, he remembers that Peter's just a kid despite all the crazy shit they'd both gone through together. That being said, it felt like Strange's motivation for helping Peter was strong enough for me to buy that he'd attempt to go through with it regardless. 

I don't think the spell is the sole reason for the multiverse. I actually think the whole multiverse thing either stems from what happened in the Loki show (opening up all these ways for the multiverse to cross different realities over into each other), or it's the kind of thing where there are all these reality-bending events happening at, or around, the same point in time, and that'll likely be the overall setup for the whole multiverse of madness thing.",ri7eum

And if I went into that final battle with having not yet seen them, I‚Äôd be watching the most tense points of the fight thinking ‚Äúok Tobey or Andrew will be here any second‚Äù and it just would have cheapened it to me. Again, just my thoughts and i totally get what you‚Äôre saying. I envisioned it the way you did as well and I‚Äôm sure I still would have been happy seeing them in that capacity, but I loved the direction they went",ri7eum
hoxxjwr,"> I absolutely loved this movie but was anybody else disappointed with how Tobey and Andrew came in? I found it a bit of an anti climax.

I thought Andrew's was great with the ripping off the mask but yeah, Tobey just kind of stumbled in street clothes lol. Not much of an entrance for the OG Spidey",ri7eum

hp7bfu7,"Disagree on 2/3:

1) It isn't lazy when you consider that they already had to balance basically a million characters and did it basically perfectly. Any additional characters would have made the plot worse. I honestly can't think of a way they could have inserted even one additional villain without making the plot/film worse/drip into Spider-man 3/Amazing Spider-man 2 territory. If you want headcanon, they 8 films are part of a single series because those are the three universes that intersect because magic knew that Holland needed Tobey's mentorship and Garfield needed to forgive himself.  

2) I think Flash was just written as a joke/riff on modern day bullies (e.g., the Jump Street films). Spider-man's physical 2000s-style bullies just aren't as real in modern day. Flash being a rich goofball who makes fun of poor/lower class Peter and adores Spider-man and doesn't really change that much seems more realistic. If they tried to make him a villain after this parody character it would basically end up as a worse version of what Raimi was forced to do with Topher Grace in Spiderman 3 (no one would buy it and it would rob us all of a villain that people actually care about). 

3) This is a plothole that was introduced because Pascal has been fighting behind the scenes with Feige to bring Venom into the MCU (which Feige doesn't want to do, but Pascal is actively trying to do at every turn, including the stupid Venom 2 after credit scene, vulture in Morbius, etc.). People believe the actual in-movie explanation is that Venom universe and Garfield universe share the same universe, and that the venom symbiote does know about Garfield at some point.",ri7eum
hp7az4u,"To your first point, the movie would have been really bad if they threw in new characters. You need time to develop characters in order for anyone to care about them. It's why Spiderman 3 and Amazing Spiderman 2 were so bad. 

This movie was only able to pull it off because they didn't have to build any of the characters. They all had their own movies so they could jump right in.",ri7eum
hp70moq,"I agree completely that they should have added at least 1 or 2 new characters. 

They basically just use Flash and Ned for comedic lines and haven‚Äôt had any actual story in 3 movies. Now they are trying to throw in a strange curveball that Ned is somehow quick to learn magic. 

As for Eddie Brock. They only pulled him through to take Venom. Even though they could have used the original origin for him.  
Tbh, I don‚Äôt think Tom Hardy wants to be a part of the McU, or had give them up playing the character now. Although he obviously has to voice the Venom left in the McU.",ri7eum

hpdgl08,"It kills Ock getting his character arc completed by gaining control of the arms once he managed to think beyond the scope of himself. HE overcame, not a 35 minute stark box invention. 

Goblin died because he couldn't see past getting over Peter, which this would solve, if it wasn't a 45 minute plot convenience of a science project. Like they straight up made a self injecting cure to a million dollar serum in a high school lab in wayyy less than 12 hours, since thats how long strange says he was trapped. It also steals his character arc of paying dearly for thinking he could never lose, and that he was above everyone else. 

In short, we like those characters because they have good arcs, and the plot was driven by both hero and villain in those movies. In seeking to be cool, this movie undoes this. It loses a point or two on the 10 scale for me for that reason.",ri7eum

hozzjii,For real! The MCU humor got really grating at times but oh man did they nail how much it SUCKS to be spider-man at the end. Incredible ending,ri7eum
hozwu58,"I think that's a little harsh, but I didnt like the 3 spider men stuff. That was way overboard. 

My problem with the film is that Doc Ock and Goblin are serious villains in their film. The highway scene was intense as hell because you know from the Raimi films that they're serious guys and not just joke machines. But throughout the movie the whole MCU-style quips and writing got to them, and kinda devalued the characters. Other characters making fun of doc Ock, or goblin saying meme lines etc just killed their sense of threat.  By the end I didn't feel any real threat because they all felt like generic MCU characters. It's sad.  

Same with electro and sandman talking about how they fell into stuff. It's unnecessary. Movies making fun of themselves destroys the immersion in the story. The Raimi movies were goofy but they never had characters acknowledge the goofiness (at least not in a self deprecating way) so the characters felt real and I was invested in it.",ri7eum
hozw9ij,"For me the 3 spider man stuff felt too fan servicey. I could never take anything involving it seriously. Even Andrew saving MJ had no emotion in it for me, it was just kinda corny and predictable. 

I loved the movie up until they showed up, but then all their scenes together were too corny and took me out of the film. I didn't like how the majority of it was just them riffing on each other and their movies. It was fun in a vacuum but in the wider sense of the film it kinda killed the stakes and momentum. 

And the scene where they talked about who they lost was way too derivative of spider verse and again the emotion didn't hit for me. I think I much prefer what the animated movie did. Live action spider verse doesn't work for me",ri7eum
hoztn8j,"Into the Spiderverse might be my favorite superhero movie in general, so I get what you mean, but I do think the film had heart, it just wasn't as eye-popping and crazy in live action with CGI as seeing the animated multiverse for the first time. That was incredible and can't be replicated.",ri7eum
hp3a38c,"Agree with most of this.

Regarding them knowing the location of the 3 spiderman that's because of Holland telling them through the Daily Bugle",ri7eum
hp2z256,"This. Okay. I felt as if I was the only one to realize the weakest point of this film is the Holland storyline. All three Spidermen together? Fan-freaking-tastic! But Mays death was weak because she lacked the built up of character between her and Peters relationship. Her shoehorned righteousness and agenda was weak because up til this scene where else in The MCU has she ever stood for such outright? It would have been more believable for Peter to decide to help the villains and Aunt May to willingly help him versus the other way around. That way her death is in fact his fault. Her death should have been gut wrenching but it wasn't, cause we don't ever get to see her relationship with Peter all that much in this iteration. The fact that Holland mentions her finding out that he was Spiderman was such a big deal is a slap to the face, because that would have been such a great character arc to explore. Here this woman is, sacrificing everything for her nephew when she likely never expected to have to raise a child all by herself. Like come on, we definitely needed a better story between them for us to care about her in this film. Also - also, the same could be said for Peter and Mj. They don't have that same foundation that Garfield and Tobey have with their leading ladies. We were given reason as to why Mary Jane grew to love Peter, and why Gwen became infatuated with him. Why does Zendaya like Holland's Peter? The script says so, because we for sure skipped the part where Peter even starts to like her, and definitely ignore her for too long in Homecoming to even understand why she's interested in such a goody goody when she's so snarky and such. The issue with this film is Holland and his relationships to these known characters around him. The MCU forgot to get us to care for these iterations, relying too much on us knowing them from past films and or the comics to fill in the gaps. Andrew and Tobey however? They stole the show, because we know who these characters are and what they had stood for in relation to their loved ones. Same for the villains, we knew and understood them from their better films.
As a  Spidermen team up film, it was great. As a Spiderman film, it was meh, cool but our Spidey sure lacked depth. Just imagine if Andrew and Tobey weren't in it. Would we feel the same? Nope. Everyone would see what surely lacked, because they were so damn easily willing to pick the previous two mcu films apart for similar reasons.",ri7eum

Venom tells Eddie in *Let There Be Carnage*‚Äôs end credit scene that they have ‚Äú80 Billion light years of hive knowledge across universes‚Äù and when he sees Peter/Spidey, Venom clearly knows exactly who he is.

Hardy‚Äôs Eddie and Venom are fully bonded and are ‚Äúone‚Äù, with Venom‚Äôs knowledge of Peter thanks to Raimi‚Äôs symbiote being bonded to him - and then killing it - so he‚Äôs the only one at that current moment who fit the requirements; so the spell had time to bring them over when the initial villains came over.

Remember, Topher Grace and the Raimi symbiote blew up in Spider-Man 3. They were both separated when it happened. Per the rules of this movie, technically they would‚Äôve had to be both brought back over before they died, and obviously the spell didn‚Äôt have enough time to bring over technically ‚Äútwo‚Äù individuals on top of the other 5.

1. He already captured the villains, they were harmless. To send them to certain death at that point just didn't sit right with Peter, who above all wants to help people.

2. Norman was obviously mentally ill and in bad need of help, but the other villains were also results of experiments gone wrong and other shit like that. Sandman wasn't even a criminal anymore. I think this is what May saw in them - from her pov they were just as much victims as the people they hurt (we can debate whether or not that's true).

3. The villains seemed to be quite open to the idea themselves.

4. Peter isn't the brightest when it comes to fully thinking things through. He wants to help and doesn't fully think about the consequences until it's too late. I feel like this was always part of the character though, it's just a bit more pronounced in this iteration.

Aunt May was his moral compass, when she gets killed, Peter abandons the idea of saving the villain for revenge. It's only the other Spider-Men that can save him from this path.",ri7eum

plus, could he have just waited like 10 seconds or asked peter to be specific. or maybe cancel the spell (if possible idk magic) instead of being like 'ah fuck this is bad but imma keep goin' or like you said, just word it better instead of this genie in a bottle nonsense.

and in the end it they straight up **changed** the spell from - people forget im spiderman to people forget im peter parker, soooo annoying.

Norman's serum didn't work on fixing him. His Green Goblin persona probably sabotaged the work.

Holland's was the weakest link here because even after two films we don't really care for his relationships with May and Mj. Why? Cause they were underwritten and relied too much on knowing who they were meant to be in past iterations. With Miles, we understood who he was to his mentor Peter, to his uncle, to his father and mother. We saw those bonds up close and felt the heartbreak when he had to say goodbye to them. His story, his arc, was never outshined by the other Spidermen. Unlike No Way Home.",ri7eum

Tdk is a well crafted action movie, with possibly the most iconic performance in modern cinema.

No Way Home is a very fun movie. Its a really, really enjoyable experience. But 90% of the enjoyment comes from knowing Tobey and Andrew, from knowing the villains, even the hints of Elfmans score.

So while that is all well and good, it's undeniably based on fanservice and nostalgia, and has quite a few flaws.

It's a good spiderman movie as a whole, and will probably become the general publics favorite, but it's not TDK.",ri7eum

Ned clearly has some sort of magic ability as he‚Äôs able to open portals (something Strange struggled to do for a while), and Peter still owes MJ an ‚ÄúI Love You‚Äù.  No way their storyline ends here.  I could see them not coming back for the next movie, but they will definitely still be a main part of the story/future series.",ri7eum
hox8sgu,"Well, Peter did promise them that he‚Äôd find them again and fix everything. Granted, he had the opportunity to do that at the diner, but maybe he just thought it wasn‚Äôt the right time to reveal everything to MJ. The great thing about Peter is that although Ned & MJ are loyal to him, he‚Äôs also loyal to THEM. I think MJ will definitely be back, and I think Ned will too, but he might have a ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù role than she does.",ri7eum
hoxswim,"They‚Äôre all going to MIT, so I‚Äôm guessing there‚Äôll be some sort of ‚Äúfate‚Äù arc where Peter doesn‚Äôt really try to force a connection with MJ and Ned, but they all end up meeting and somehow (maybe through Ned‚Äôs magic) they regain their memories of Peter. Maybe they all become friends and Peter keeps slipping up by saying things about them he shouldn‚Äôt know from their perspective and has to explain the truth. Maybe without Peter in his life, Ned turns into a villain, showing the importance of their friendship. Lots of interesting ways they could go about it",ri7eum

4) JJJ isn‚Äôt really in the movie all too much. I want to say he has like 5-8 scenes. The very beginning, newsroom, outside apartment, newsroom after the apartment, live interview with Spider-Man, and I think one more newsroom scene towards the end.",ri7eum

Having an arc where his tampering with mysticism leads to a demonic possession Hobgoblin origin (maybe mixing a little of his origin from the comics with Macendale's).

Without having his connection to Peter that grounded him, he may continue to be more reckless or less responsible with magic as a result. It'd be an interesting consequence of No Way Home's events.

I keep selfishly posting about how I want The Hood introduced, so even bending that origin into it slightly would be nice too! Have Ned continue developing his mystic interests (assuming he still remembers everything except Peter, including his experience meeting Dr. Strange and helping in the battle of the Statue of Liberty), utilize a dark magic cloak capable of bringing otherworldly entities into this world, one of which winds up possessing him, being saved and exorcised by Spider-Man and/or the Marvel Knights, only for the cloak to then wind up in the hands of Parker Robbins who unwittingly forms his partnership with Dormammu through it.

What matters is there presence puts the reality Strange is in a risk.

And I like that Peter made the call not to involve MJ and Ned again. Even if it's against their wishes. He's just lived through a nightmare scenario where he saw the danger knowing him puts the people he loves in. How it can ruin their opportunities as well as take their lives. And they were happy. He gives them up in the hopes they'll stay safe and happy. It's not about right or wrong. Or him thinking he knows best. He just can't bare to put the people he loves in any more risk.

The villains and other spidies came through the portals because they knew Peter Parker was Spiderman, so their logic was that if noone knows who Peter Parker is then the villains can't go through and everyone goes back to their world...but then that means the spell had to make it so noone across the multiverse remembered Peter Parker. 

In theory not only does that mean Tobey and Andrew's universes also forgot about them, but the wording makes it sound as if not even Tobey and Andrew remember they are Spider-Man, that's why they went back to their worlds.

I don't know. It's fucking weird. Because of how confusing it is, I'm just going to assume that only people in the MCU don't remember who Peter Parker is and that stabilized the rift and prevented the multiverse from merging.

MCU Spidey hadn‚Äôt really experienced any consequences for his actions yet. Sure, Stark died, but his death had basically nothing to do with Peter‚Äôs actions. He had to experience May‚Äôs death to gain that weight of personal responsibility that is a defining trait of Spider Man across multiple different iterations. The saving villains vs defeating them vs killing them is another important storyline that the whole multiverse theme is just a framework for. The fact is, MCU Spidey, especially with the Iron Spider suit, is already at near peak mastery of his powers. When he‚Äôs not dealing with cosmic level threats, he pretty easily outmatches any villain 1v1. It‚Äôs up to him to set those limits on himself and is important to his ‚Äúwith great power‚Äù core ideal. It‚Äôs not just a responsibility to the everyday  people to help them, it‚Äôs also a responsibility to hold back and not cross that line when he comes up against these supervillains.

The whole movie was about setting up MCU Spider-Man to be a more classic Spider-Man. Not just another cog in the MCU wheel, not an Iron Man replacement, just a young man out there to help the people of his city behind a mask (seriously, secret identities have basically disappeared from the MCU at this point), while carrying the weight of his losses with him.",ri7eum

My favorite visual metaphor to explain the implication of infinite universes is to picture a sandy beach that extends infinitely. If you consider each grain of sand as a universe with a unique shape, it stands to reason that there are infinite shapes that grain of sand could take, but if there are infinite grains of sand, then there must also be infinite grains of sand that have the same shape as each other.

Most likely because Peter was getting followed around by news helicopters and we saw one watching him on the bridge so his location at that time was known to the whole world.

The spell was pretty much worthless since the beginning.

I'm sorry to say, but it doesn't sound like that's gonna happen, at least according to this quote from Tom: 

""We were all treating [No Way Home] as the end of a franchise, let's say,"" he adds. ""I think if we were lucky enough to dive into these characters again, you'd be seeing a very different version. It would no longer be the Homecoming trilogy. We would give it some time and try to build something different and tonally change the films. Whether that happens or not, I don't know. But we were definitely treating [No Way Home] like it was coming to an end, and it felt like it."" (source: https://ew.com/movies/tom-holland-spider-man-no-way-home-preview/ ).

hpqq1pc,I wonder if those videos of audience reactions when Cap picked up Mjolnir and all the portals opening and the audience going nuts made people in the UK think maybe it's ok to cheer during a movie.

A farmed out support worker probably reads your email and never passes it on.

hp2hnaj,Honestly I was kinda shocked by how gung ho Dr. Strange was in finding a solution. Like he didn't even bother sorting out details or contingencies and decided to mention it in the middle of the spell causing Peter to blurt out random things to disrupt the spell.,ri7eum
hp08lxq,Absolutely. The fact the spell went wrong is entirely on Strange.,ri7eum
hp0fovm,"Enh. Strange should have thought the consequences over more, but Peter was avoiding ordinary person effort. Its in his character that he prefers superheroing to regular person stuff. 

Its a superhero trope that Hero is doubted, then Hero is forgiven because he is needed to save the day. Peter already got there by saving the MIT lady. But its also in Peter's character that he can't deal with guilt. Spider-man was originally part of Peter's method of running away from guilt over his Uncle Ben's death. He can't accept bad things, and does STUPID things to try and make them not real. Refusing to move on in a world where his identity was public like the other Avengers is an example of Peter's bad coping. Dr Strange is an enabler.",ri7eum
hp0kiuj,"Agreed. What Strange should‚Äôve done after Peter wanted to add Ned is shut the whole thing down, and then redo it but this time with two rings, one with all of the people he wants to know and the other is the rest. Spell goes normally, everything is golden.",ri7eum
hp13ogf,Seems like most of the new MCU problems could‚Äôve been avoided if Dr Strange was actually good at his job.,ri7eum
hp4gcnd,"Lol, kept thinking this - all they had to do apparently (as strange agreed to his first condition) is discuss the details before going ahead",ri7eum
hpmxj2t,This movie really made Dr. Strange seem like the most irresponsible person in the MCU,ri7eum
hspaw7c,"What should have happened is this: Strange agrees to help Peter. After talking about what he wants for 5 minutes,  he tells Peter he's sorry, but the spell is too complicated, and he'd rather not risk harming reality. Hey, b-t-dubbs, have you tried just calling MIT admissions and pleading your case?

Peter calls admissions, they tell him sorry, but you're too big a risk blah blah blah, and blow him off.

Peter goes to Ned and says we need to steal Strange's spell book, hemlock, and wolfsbane, or magic arm cuff or whatever, They steal the magic shit, and Ned performs the spell because of something his mom told him about his family. The spell predictably goes to shit. (But hey, he managed to do something magical! *wink wink*)

Strange storms on scene, furious, and orders Peter to clean his mess, and go back to calling him Sir. This scene would closely mirror Tony reprimanding Peter after the ferry incident.",ri7eum
hupohj9,"The premise was very janky. However, Strange's earlier scene with Thor in Ragnorak sort of made things a bit more believable.

Strange basically manhandled Thor and Lok -- two incredibly dangerous super beings. It worked out that time but it really showcased how incredibly smug Strange can be.

As someone who orchestrated the defeat of Thanos, Strange probably feels almost untouchable.",ri7eum
hoz29gm,"Or they would have taken the phone call from his mentor's widow asking them to reconsider. ""Spider-Man"" might not have carried much weight but I'm sure that ""Tony Stark's protege"" would have.",ri7eum
hpdwg8w,"Cap is an old man and considered dead at this point.

In the comics they actually do try this at one point. All of the Avengers show up to a meeting with J. Jonah Jameson and Captain America personally vouches got Spider-Man... J. J. J. Then claims all of the avengers are sellouts and possibly brainwashed.",ri7eum
hp0n256,It wont but realistically he is in the avengers. He could get into whatever school or get whatever job he wants because they are probably treated like gods in this univers after saving the universe and everything.  College is probably redundant at that point lol,ri7eum
hp0jxa0,"I mean, before his identity was revealed, no one who really mattered knew, especially since Stark is dead. Besides, the thing about Spiderman (that they kept repeating in the film) is that he wants the normal life AND the superhero one.",ri7eum
hp2tw5m,"He's got a genius grasp of chemistry and math but that doesn't mean he couldn't use the connections and experience that college gives you. Hell, a lot of the stuff that boosted him was Stark tech. Plus this is the MCU, who knows what geniuses he'd meet at MCU MIT.",ri7eum
hp1loqr,"That's true. It's probably just because he wants to go with his friends, and going to college is just the next step. But yeah he could start a company that would rival Stark Industries just with his knowledge. He could patent his web fluid and make millions, I'm sure that stuff probably has all kinds of real world applications..",ri7eum
hpidd0e,nobody goes to MIT just for the knowledge.,ri7eum
hp4xeju,"Actually, I'd say it came out worse. The first spell would have just been everyone forgetting he was Spider-Man. The second essentially wiped him from existence. Which begs the question how is he doing anything with no identity?",ri7eum
hpey61a,Nah. It was a special magnet high school and that sort of intake happens all the time. MIT regularly accepts 5-10 people yearly from private schools such as Exeter and even some general public schools with good reputations like Winchester High School in Massachussets usually get a number of entries. 6 for the class of 2020 for example (people I know personally). Not sure about numbers for other years but the data is probably out there.,ri7eum
hoyacj1,It would've been nice if the Venom 2 end credit scene was the only indication of anyone coming in from another universe. Everyone going in expecting only Venom to show up and just get hit with all those villains and the 2 Spideys. It would have been great,ri7eum

hxsv6p6,"i think the venom thing is going to be relevant in the next movie because now without stark tech to back him up peter is going to have a harder time dealing with villains and he is going to have it rough, like dealing with regular robers and the like is probably not going to be all that hard but if the next big villain i the scorpion or someone like that then he is going to have problems without the nanotech suit and all that

but the symbiote kind of works in a similar way rebuilding itself and growing and being able to be stored in a small space so peter will use it as a sort of replacement for that without realizing the secondary effects of a symbiote, maybe they will make a reference that he remembers that one of the other peters mentioned something about a weird black goo alien and go from there",ri7eum

Tobey's death probably didn't go over well with the test audiences and was changed would be my guess. Also, in the filming, they may have thought that 'hey this movie is going to be a mega-hit and maybe Toby M may be open for an other appearance if this one goes over well' so they decided to not close that door by killing him off.",ri7eum
howo0g7,I thought the same thing.,ri7eum

hr8ya24,me too; we kind of knew that Venom was somewhere in this universe and technically Spidey's sense has always been wonky in terms of Venom. I half expected him to just bust in under some feral rage due to the symbiote's desire for Parker,ri7eum

There's plenty of scenes where he hams it up, yes, but he's not doing it because he's a hack or because he's not taking the movie seriously, he's doing it because that's just the way it's written.  When the scene actually calls for him to be more subtle and reserved, he plays it perfectly.  I agree that this movie did a better job than the Raimi movie of portraying Norman as a really tragic and sympathetic character, but still, the Raimi one DOES have its moments where it reminds you he's still a human being who deep down is trying to fight against this alter-ego, but tragically losing, and Dafoe really nails those moments and does make me feel bad for him in that movie.",ri7eum

Goblin: bipolar? Or dissociative personality



Doc Ock: schizophrenia (""the voices"" making him do things)


Electro: drug addiction (seeking a bigger high, almost getting clean but then relapsing)


Even Spider-Man seemed like a representation of anxiety disorder.  The scene of him walking down the school hallway with everyone staring at him seemed like what social anxiety feels like.

Garfield's great, Emma Stone as Gwen is the best love interest in any of the movies, Lizard was a really good first villain. Just a great movie overall. Wish we'd gotten more of Garfield.

That‚Äôs 5. And perhaps there may be more villains that were part of Scorpions group in prison like Rhino. Only problem is that they would be missing more iconic villains like Doc Ock, green goblin, and mysterio. But they could go down the hob goblin route and maybe use the female doc ock in place of normal doc ock (he was already used in No way Home so it‚Äôd be kind of weird to use him again, even if it‚Äôs a alternate version.) 

Assuming these predictions are right, we would have a team of

1. Doc Ock

2. Hog Goblin

3. Shocker 

4. Rhino

5. Vulture

6. The new symbiote presumably being a alternate venom

hox79fq,"Andrew's Peter felt somewhat bland in his movies but is a hilarious ""cheery"" secondary support character. His quip game was on point throughout, and so it was for every other character. I feel like unwarranted ""heheh im here, yknow, coping with superhero stress"" humor has been bogging down MCU movies lately, but with three Peter Parkers on screen it just felt right at home.",ri7eum

hponvon,His reaction to being Peter 3 had me cracking up.,ri7eum
hoxmzru,Occupational hazard.,ri7eum
huppp4p,It's really awesome how they were able to capture each spiderman's character. They had to make every line count. And they did.,ri7eum
hp1w554,Delivery and line were perfect. Loved Foxx in the movie. Fun just radiating off of him. It was so much more his speed than the dour role in ASM2.,ri7eum
hp3iraa,Jamie Foxx killed this version. I thought all his jokes where gold in this.,ri7eum
howyzo0,Yep when Sandman told him he fell into whatever it is he fell into lol,ri7eum
hp40kxi,Spider Man's real enemy is the absence of guardrails.,ri7eum
hp9j5ug,No one laughed at that line except my friend and I in a packed theater. I thought it was great,ri7eum
i0svahs,I loved that both Sandman and Electro shared their very similar origin stories to each other and they both said it earnestly too. Underrated moment.,ri7eum
hp4i5q3,Why didn't they think it could be his girlfriend?,ri7eum
hp06der,Maybe as he was absorbing data he figured out that Spider-Man's real name is Peter Parker but didn't figure out what Peter looks like.,ri7eum
hp1fyc4,He probably only knew that Spider-Man is a dude named Peter Parker from Queens.,ri7eum
hpd4jlg,That'll do it.,ri7eum
how8v9k,I could've listened to them talk up there for another 20 minutes,ri7eum
hoxqnqk,"This is one of the main references I was hoping for in the movie. The only 2 I didn't get were Tobey noticing the same J. Jonah Jameson and I was also hoping that when Home Peter mentioned his ""tingle"" that the other 2 Spider-Men would tell him to call it Spider Sense so he finally stops calling it his ""tingle"" lol.",ri7eum
howiqrz,"""So does it come out of.. anywhere else..?"" Asking the big questions",ri7eum
howg700,My fav joke was when Andrew yelled GROSS when he had first contact with Tobey‚Äôs webs,ri7eum
hozikj0,I honestly thought Garfield was going to ask him the first time they met. Cuz Tobey was clearly not wearing web-shooters (and wasn't even in costume). Glad they got back around to it.,ri7eum

hp6az8d,Him catching the brick was amazing.,ri7eum

hp4rfbt,It was good to see him but if they start putting him in the movies it would ruin it for me. The Netflix series was definitely for mature viewers and I don't see how you could tone that down to be more kid friendly.,ri7eum
hp595wz,Yes!! I loved that.,ri7eum
hq8ohz6,I just about DIED!!  I was SO HAPPY!!,ri7eum
hp57c9o,Not gonna lie I marked out for his scene.,ri7eum
hp4b4im,"I really would not mind if they made an Amazing Spider-Man 3 or something, I liked Garfield and would love to expound on that line.",ri7eum
hp6b3qh,Probably not actively killing criminals but I imagine he wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to put them in the ICU.,ri7eum
hp0y74m,Or atleast putting people in critical care,ri7eum
hp38i8a,I feel like he just doesn't beat around the bush taking down villains any more. The end of ASM2 kind of hints at this with him yeeting a manhole cover at Rhino.,ri7eum
hoyse3a,"So, this is both true and not true. Tobey was never going to drop out of SM2. He did suffer a back injury when a horse kicked him during the filming of Seabiscuit between SM1 and SM2, but the doctors were confident of his full recovery from the get-go, and Sam Raimi (the director) was specific about saying that at most it would mean a delay in filming, not a recasting. But the tabloids got wind of the news of his injury before Raimi and Maguire could make any kind of public statement, and they ran with it and blew things out of proportion, as tabloids always do. The headlines of ""Will Tobey Maguire have to drop out of SM2?"" simply sold more newspapers than ""Tobey suffers minor back injury, filming delayed."" Sam then wrote that new scene into the script as a meta way of MAKING FUN of those same tabloids for causing unnecessary panic among the fans.",ri7eum
hoxavpp,Also the fact he's canonically in his 40s at this point so much older and back pain is common as people age,ri7eum
hox3m98,"He lied about his injury for more money from Sony back for Spider-Man 2. They said they'll recast and called his bluff and he apologized to Sony and they let him stay. That's why they have the newspaper on 2 that says ""Can spinal injuries lead to brain damage?""",ri7eum
hozgy67,Matt Murdock absolutely demolished my theatre,ri7eum
hp0nlek,"That's my biggest disappointment about my viewing 

Almost empty theater so no audience reactions

hutk723,Just here a month later to let you know I was in hysterics for that entire scene.,ri7eum
hp21k1t,"Nope. Plus, that scene was itself in reference to Tobey Maguire's real life back injury.",ri7eum
hpd6fd8,Gonna put some dirt in your eye!,ri7eum
how632f,Sorry were you saying that he's really heavy or something because of his powers? Or that normal people don't touch superheroes like that. Genuine questions because I don't know much about this universe (multiverse!). Loved the movie!,ri7eum
howb43l,"I was shocked at the height difference. I full though Tobey was a foot taller than Andrew, who I always thought was short. It's the friggin opposite.",ri7eum
hq3qnio,I don‚Äôt think Spider-Man is any heavier than a normal dude.,ri7eum
i523c60,46 actually. Looks great.,ri7eum
hp0b0r2,Andrew got more ‚Äúin your face‚Äù moments but we got a lot of resolution with Tobey: knowing that he and Mary Jane are together and him squashing his demons by saving Norman from the glider blades.,ri7eum
hozh1m8,I saw it as him playing lower energy older,ri7eum
hp07w7g,"He's my favorite too but it seemed like he was just Spider-Dad in this one, he's proven himself as the best so wants to see the kids do well, while Andrew was Spider-Bro because his movies were pretty weak and he wants to look cool in front of the little Spider.",ri7eum
hp0aldk,There‚Äôs a reason Tobey isn‚Äôt in prestige movies and Andrew is.,ri7eum
howajta,"The original ""my back"" joke from Spider-Man 2 was included by Sam (Raimi) because Tobey sustained a back injury while filming Seabiscuit between SM 1 & 2, and there was genuine concern over whether or not this back injury would impact the filming of SM 2, and Sam thought that was funny.

I'm unsure if Tobey still to this day has back problems, but a back injury is in fact the original genesis of the scene from Spider-Man 2, which is what is then being referenced again here.",ri7eum
hp6ysmp,Cracked his back,ri7eum
hp18wj7,"I agree that the movie seemed to indulge in fan service, but the back issue went over my head because I wasn't aware of Toby's back injury and I forgot about the back reference in *Spider-man 2.*",ri7eum

howz5ym,I was wondering if Garfield Spider-Man beat him to death after that speech of him not pulling his punches anymore.,ri7eum

Him ducking out of the apartment, realizing that shit's gonna hit the fan is one thing--but this is a man who looked as if he were never going to forgive himself for killing Ben Parker *by accident,* and he's fighting alongside the other villains. 

He said he's just after the box--which I do believe. But they could have framed it a little bit better that, like Doc Ock, he was waiting for an opening. 

After all, this is *Sandman.* There's not much Goblin can do to hurt him, so there's no reason for him not to try and kill Goblin himself and then go after the stupid box.",ri7eum

I wasn‚Äôt much of a fan of the first TaSM movie, but I loved TaSM2 mostly because a girl in my group kept crying at all the sad parts and it made those moments hit a lot harder than they probably would have had I watched it alone.",ri7eum
hp9iugn,Honestly the reaction to TASM is fair. It's a great movie. Same tier as the first two Raimi ones for sure. The second one was bad but tbh overhated. It was better than Raimi's third. Shame there wasn't a third one to try and redeem himself.,ri7eum
hp58rnv,The train scene in TASM1 felt like a parody of a Jackie Chan fight scene.,ri7eum
hp98tw9,this description has me weepy again. this movie was just so good.,ri7eum
howmqqp,I think Andrew was lowkey always the most liked and popular Spider-Man. The main issue was that his movies where just so bad.,ri7eum
hp17k7l,"Well, he was also the first of the Spider-Men to appear, and he arguably had the best moments. Tobey‚Äôs Spider-Man felt finished in a way Andrew‚Äôs never did. Not to mention how badly Andrew got treated at the end. His character - and the actor - deserved to get to feel like a hero again on screen, whereas Tobey hanging a bit more back, being the wise mentor who is just there to help makes sense, is touching, but not as grand. 

I really didn‚Äôt like TASM, but I think I probably cheered the loudest over Andrew‚Äôs Spider-Man anyway. As I said, he had just the best moments, and after Andrew‚Äôs performance in Tick, Tick Boom and that press tour, I think he has a lot of good will with a lot of people. 

TLDR; I don‚Äôt think the reaction to this film makes him the most popular Spider-Man, as much as he was very well-portrayed in this film, and people just like Andrew.",ri7eum
hozf9pc,Hes gotten a lot of love in this past year,ri7eum
hp1ck3q,"I thought it was me, but my theater definitely reacted louder to Andrew than to Tobey. I'm not sure if it's because he's more popular, or if it's just because that scene basically confirmed ""oh yeah both of them will be in this""",ri7eum
howejpg,"My only complaint about Andrew was that he was too cool as Peter Parker. He was fantastic in the suit but Peter is supposed to be more nerdy and weird outside of the suit. Tobey felt like the inverse where he captured the awkwardness of Peter Parker very well but he wasn't witty enough or charming enough in the suit. 

I still feel like Tom has the best balance between the awkwardness of Peter Parker and the wittiness of Spider-Man. I'm sure Andrew can pull it off with the right script and direction, we just haven't seen it yet. Hopefully they continue Andrew's movies though because I think it'd be really neat to have both an MCU Spider-Man where all the crossovers happen and a solo-focused Spider-Man where only Spider-Man characters appear.",ri7eum
hp0r8em,"I really enjoyed the first Amazing Spiderman with Andrew, especially since Doc Connors was always a favorite of mine. Would have loved to see this version of Electro in the second one. I felt like how his character originally was really brought down that movie.",ri7eum
hp0s58b,"Lmao you gotta calm down on that part 'Andrew is considered more popular'. From what i've witnessed on social media and in theatre, the reception for Tobey Maguire is massive. The loudest i've ever heard in ky life",ri7eum
hozndbh,"I liked that joke/call-back but I wish they hadn't dragged it out so much.  Yes, we get it, his movie was called the *Amazing* Spider-Man.",ri7eum
hoycnso,Ive always felt he was the best Peter Parker. Toby the best Spiderman and Tom the best movies.,ri7eum
hozfblo,Yeah I don‚Äôt think that scene was anything other than a pun,ri7eum
hp9j1rf,"Tom's is definitely my least favorite. It's not on him, but on the movies tho. He's more of an MCU character than a SpiderMan so far. That's what it feels like at least. Like he's had the most screentime of any so far and yet i still feel the least attached to him.",ri7eum
howhu0o,"It makes a lot of sense why so many people's opinion may differ. 

The way I've most often heard it described: Tobey Maguire is the best Peter Parker, but the worse Spiderman. Garfield is the best Spiderman, but the worse Peter Parker. Meanwhile Holland is a mix of both, he's a better Peter Parker than Garfield and a better Spiderman than Maguire, but worse in the opposite categories.",ri7eum
hp7yist,"NWH addressed the ASM villains in an offhand line of Garfield saying something like ""I fought a Russian in a rhino suit"" after Holland talked about fighting Thanos in space",ri7eum
hp10tq8,But Tobey's Spider-Man did crack wise when the situation called for it. His lines were corny for a reason.,ri7eum
hox95cx,IMO the scene where they met Holland for the first time and related with their own tragic experiences was so well done that it actually made it somewhat believable that he could be convinced not to activate the cube even after what Green Goblin did.,ri7eum

hp043yu,"I thought it was great, because even in the Raimi films he had a habit of wearing his civilian clothes over the suit. He's done a couple of Superman-like shirt rips in the original films, and I loved that we got a glimpse of that again.",ri7eum
hox88hu,I knew it was okay because he always wears his suit under his street outfit.,ri7eum
howwnko,I'm not a fan of Marvel and haven't really been keeping up with the movies for years now but I did watch the Raimi movies when I was kid. Seeing Tobey again as Spider-Man definitely made it much more memorable for me,ri7eum
hox8q8w,"I have to think that was a case of ‚ÄúTobey doesn‚Äôt look as good in the suit as he used to, so we‚Äôre only putting him in it in the scene in the dark",ri7eum

hpe8j1t,"Part of that is we were so used to seeing Tobey‚Äôs Peter jump head first, suited up into things.

When he peeked the suit under his shirt, I got so excited!!",ri7eum

hoy7smd,"Agreed! That shot was fantastic, can't wait to see it again on rewatch",ri7eum
hpiaf6u,"That's the moment when he finally ~became Spider-Man for me. For every appearance he's made in the MCU so far, Peter's essentially just been a lesser Iron Man, with absolutely none of his usual problems plaguing him. Not hurting for money, doesn't have to worry about people discovering his identity, etc. 
  
Spider-Man's relentless endurance in the minds and hearts of people the world over doesn't come from him being an awkward, motor-mouthed teenager. It's because his life ***sucks.*** He's ***the*** Marvel superhero and his life is perpetually in the shitter. He's always a day late and a dollar short and will always disappoint those closest to him no matter how much he tries. People die and he can't do anything about it. But he ***will*** keep trying. And they finally seemed to realize that.",ri7eum

hp4a4ff,[removed],ri7eum
hpekn42,"I don't know about all that. I do agree that there's an element to it that robs MJ and Ned of their own agency, and in that regard it's somewhat of a selfish choice. However, it doesn't bother me because I think that feeling of imbalance is intentional. I think Peter will eventually rebuild his relationship with Ned and MJ, and maybe allow them to help, but I don't think the time is right for Peter, especially hot off the heels of Aunt May's death and dealing with his own part that he played in that. I think at the end of this movie, Peter's genuinely doing what's best for everyone for the time being. Given everything he's been through at this point in the story, the fact that he's not in a constant traumatized state of emotional distress and PTSD is nothing short of a miracle. He's not going to be doing his friends any favors by not figuring his own shit out first. And I think there's more nuance to it than him simply trying to protect his friends. I think on a deeper level, Peter realized he isn't actually ready to let them back into his life. Of course, I think the status quo will be challenged in the future, and I certainly don't think we're meant to believe that Peter's just going to completely give up his friends forever to go do Spider-man stuff. It's just that the literal fabric of reality was being torn apart in the climax of this movie, so there really weren't any better options at the moment other than ""make everyone forget about Peter Parker."" I think the lesson he's learned, that he needed to learn in this specific movie, is that if you're in a rare position to actually help someone, it's your responsibility to do so. And the lesson he'll likely learn in the future, is that no one person is an island, and sometimes you need to help yourself with the help of others. And thus opens the door to him realizing that letting MJ and Ned live in ignorance is selfish in its own way and creates an imbalance in his life.",ri7eum
hpk9k0a,"It's very Spider-Man, though. Like, shouldering a burden alone out of a misguided but well-meaning attempt to protect and shelter his loved ones? Very Spider-Man.",ri7eum

hpekw6t,"I definitely understand that perspective of it, but I think there's an element to it that goes a little deeper than Peter simply trying to protect his friends and make a ""sacrifice"" by keeping them out of his life. I think there's a feeling of personal trauma that he needs to deal with first before he's actually ready to let them back into his life, and he really just needs to figure out his Spider-man shit first.",ri7eum
how2g17,It feels like it negates the whole fact of him in the mcu,ri7eum
hp4wrre,I totally agree.  The movie spent a lot of time building up that he‚Äôs not just Spider Man.    Tobey and Andrew talk about it when going over Tobeys MJ.  Strange presses it early on.  MJ too.  The ending walked right away from that set up and flipped a bird to MJ and Neds consistently being key characters in Spider Man‚Äôs development as a hero.  Good movie shitty ending.,ri7eum
hox2rin,"The problem with Spidey's fame is that Mysterio was setting himself up for publicity. So that when he died, his team manipulated the media to make it look like the ""team b avenger"" just killed a rising star out of jealousy. That plus Jameson already hating on him his entire career.

And just because the legal system didn‚Äôt/couldn‚Äôt hold him accountable, like Matt said in the film, public opinion wouldn‚Äôt be so easily swayed. The courts found OJ innocent but ask half of America and they will still call him a murderer. I‚Äôm sure there is a big part of the universe who believe in Spider-Man and think he‚Äôs the true hero and all, but their voices aren‚Äôt as loud or prominent as those calling for his head.",ri7eum

Then he helps save the day fighting Thanos, but again nobody was there except the other people saving the universe. Even his previous work with the Avengers was a brief stint at an abandoned airport where he was trying to arrest Captain America, who's been idealized for eighty years.

We know he's amazing because we've spent all this time with him, but to the average person in the MCU he's a C-list hero at best and at worst his main claim to fame is going after other heroes.",ri7eum

hox7xte,Hawkeye wasn't the target of a media blitz where he was accused of murdering another hero,ri7eum
hps7j07,"I think it is that the public dynamic is completely different.  Hawkeye was visible to millions of New Yorkers and in tons of footage during the first alien encounter on Earth.

Spider-Man was on Titan, then the Avengers compound fighting Thanos.  People could only read about him, it wasn‚Äôt seen and he was blurred in the context of literally 50 other new hero‚Äôs that showed up to fight Thanos there.  To the average person, he was one of a bunch of anybody with a power and a pulse to stop Thanos.  So the natural admiration for Endgame fell to the five Avengers the public already knew well.",ri7eum
hpys24j,"That is a major plot hole in my opinion. It's long been established that in the MCU the general public somehow know all the details of all the avengers fights (like in wandavision when Darcy knew every detail about what happened in Wakanda) so the fact Peter wouldn't have more support and be scrutinized by gov and media and citizens makes no sense.

It‚Äôs what made the scene where Hollands spider sense went off at the penthouse so powerful. We‚Äôve never seen someone‚Äôs intentions trigger the spider sense, it was always a direct action like a thrown car from behind or attempted ambush. Just being in the same room as a mind that malevolent was enough to trigger it and not turn off.

I think it demonstrated to Hollands Peter that for all the he has experience in the MCU against a variety of opponents from Vulture to Thanos, nothing could prepare him for fighting someone like the Goblin. He has no mercy and actually enjoys inflicting pain and actively wants to ruin Parkers moral code. It was only by losing May that MCU Peter could find that edge to push himself to beat someone that vicious and that strong. And that whole exchange at the end between him and Maguires Peter, you could tell he completely understood the rage, as the Goblin almost broke him too by putting his Aunt May in the hospital and threatening to torture and kill Mary Jane, and he had to go to a similarly dark place to beat Goblin the first time.

hpaqmrr,"I don't, I need as much of the creative team from DD season 3 back before an announcement. And it absolutely needs to be styled in the same way it was before, with bare minimum input from Disney. I enjoy the MCU style most of the time, but if that style is applied to Daredevil, it would absolutely ruin it for me. His series is so fucking good, it's literal art that transcends the superhero genre, so it needs to be done in the same way.",ri7eum

hpa76s4,"Androids, aliens, wizards",ri7eum
hovnvc1,"It was genuine and thats why it worked. All spideys are usually charismatic so them hyping each other without knowing about anything is pretty in line with them. In other words, shit was practically a comic book scene.",ri7eum

hp1o7u2,"at least that. Because Tobey was always a lot older than the age he was playing in his movies. In this one I assume he's playing a Peter Parker who's actually his age, in his mid forties, which would mean he's been Spider-Man for 25+ years",ri7eum

how3ju2,yeah that was nothing compared to his rollercoaster of a relationship lol,ri7eum
hoxjea7,Dude wasn‚Äôt phased at all being in a new universe. He quickly adapted and took in as much information as possible and then went to find a solution.

howmxhc,"That was always the way he played the role though, which I like. He‚Äôs the calm and collected Spider-Man.

howrdz8,"Andrew was clearly having a blast. He and Jamie Foxx were chewing the scenery in every scene they were in. Especially how maligned TASM2 was, it was great to see. 

It wasn‚Äôt a perfect film. But it was a thematically perfect movie executed very well. My only real grievance is I wished Norman had stayed covert. Like Peter‚Äôs sense kept going off, but he could never pinpoint it was Osborn, and out of pity for everything he lost he/they figured out a way to let him stay in the MCU, only to have him reveal himself to be  the Norman we know and love, setting up the Thunderbolts or Dark Avengers, serving as the next big bad in the wings.",ri7eum
hozfjy8,"I'm so happy he got to come back and be welcomed and accepted. Tobey was a great Peter, Andrew was a great Spiderman and I think they both got to do what they were best at. And whether or not they appear on screen again is whatever but this was so awesome for both of them. You know Andrew wanted to be the guy still playing Spidey and he got to shine.",ri7eum

hp0esm3,Ao those timelines change now or did Peter just create new branched realities in the multiverse?,ri7eum

howok25,"Andrew was having fun but a few times his accent slipped out. Tom has been more consistant with his accent. It helped that he shaped his performance after Michael J. Fox's Marty McFly.

We're not in the 90s anymore, skater bro have not been the cool kids for a very long time. Heck even when I was in school in the early 2000s and a skater, it wasn't the thing cool kids did.

>Garfield‚Äôs Spidey uses his wits to improvise and adapt on the go.

Tbf Holland did beat Dr. Strange by using on the fly geometry, that scene doesn't get spoken about much but I really loved seeing the smarts of Peter come into play like that.

But honestly I agree with your overall premise, Garfields Spidey was definitely the best and I really hope we get more of him, he's a fantastic actor and the way his Spider-man was written personality wise was fantastic. He also has the best Flash Thomson which goes under the radar a lot I feel.",ri7eum
hpif1wx,Garfield Spidey is my favorite by far!! He brings so so much emotion and sincerity to Peter. I could never really get into Holland's Peter (although he's great too) because Marvel really ruined all his stories and he was barely his own person separate from Tony Stark/Ironman,ri7eum
hprwj66,"6 days late, but I cried in front of my teenage son at that part. Teared up at several scenes tbh.",ri7eum
hpifpn7,"same, most important moment of the movie for me! I didn't know I needed that catharsis until it happened, ig I've been carrying the heartbreak from watching Gwen die almost ten years ago! Can heal now, and so can Garfield's Peter :') Seeing That Scene in theaters when I was a teenager...it still haunts me how chilling it was. Waterworks both then and now",ri7eum
hp1duj4,"To be fair he jumped the first time too, just couldn't win gravity",ri7eum

hovt05v,"They really played to all the strengths of the cast. I think Lizard was the weakest because he doesn't really have a motivation, but Doc Ock was still a good guy, Sandman just wanted to be left alone, Electro was power drunk and easily corrupted, and Goblin was the maniacal driving force that set everything about Spider-Man in motion. They really captured the feel of the villains from their respective films.

I have no doubt that if Tobey's Peter had met Holland's Peter before things went south with the villains, he would have warned him Goblin was the most dangerous of them.",ri7eum
hp3b7e2,Yeah he really knows how to go fullbore in the traumatic evil performance. Jamie Foxx was a little too cocky and cool but I guess it fit his character?,ri7eum

I usually prefer my films to be in silence so I can soak in the onscreen stuff and process it all. For that I go to early showings on my own (maybe that makes me a loser), but I genuinely enjoyed the moments when everyone got hyped about the alternate spidermans coming through.

Now there's no company to worry about, and he's been given a whole rogue gallery that he knows he just has to wait for the right moment to get them all to turn on Peter. Which is what happens, and we get to see him just go full chaos on Peter.",ri7eum
hovy97u,Yea this was a really cool look at how superhero movie writing has changed over the years. I really hope Sony goes all-in on the spiderverse idea and we get more movies for both Tobey and Garfield. Especially Garfield I never really like his movies or him too much but my god with this he won me over. Poor dude got robbed with how badly written his movies were vs what they could have been.,ri7eum
hovwlw3,The outfit made him campy. He was always scarier without it. Still remember his mirror scene in the original movie. Amazing work. Without the suit or need to hide his identity Dafoe's face was in full effect. And you remember that he turned himself into a crazed super soldier when trading blows with Peter.,ri7eum

Hopefully Disney and Sony can somehow make this. It would be a great ending for Toms Spiderman.

Edit: [Tom said he would like that](https://www.gq.com/story/tom-holland-superhero-of-the-year-2021)

hpcvw16,"This is where I'm a bit confused.  Like, the Avengers know there is a spider man, but just have no clue who he is, even though they saved the world with him?  Is the idea they think he just never removed his mask?",ri7eum

Tony Stark figured out Peter Parker was spiderman all on his own, so even if the timeline was affected somehow, Tony would still recruit spidey and he would become an avenger.

The ending was awesome, but I agree this should be explored and resolved in the future versus just having Peter completely move on and MJ/Ned/Happy out of his life permanently.",ri7eum
hoxda1x,Oh many I would to see Ned and MJ get their memories back and be *pissed* that Peter essentially went back on his promise to come find them. Especially after they specifically asked him to run those sort of things by them first!,ri7eum
how4jt5,oooo! that's a solid point! i would love to see that explored in the next film! I think it's definitely within the realm of the sequel since we really only get a glimpse of Pete's headspace after the events of the spell.,ri7eum
hoxco32,"The part that stuck with me was after he loses May, MJ and Ned summon the other spider-men. Mcguire says that he feels like Holland needs him for some reason and MJ, almost in tears, answers yes because right now, she and Ned are pretty much all their Peter has left in the world. Her heart is breaking so much that she can't help her Peter she's ready to cry to two multiverse versions of him. It reinforces her calming Holland down when he's freaking out about dragging her and Ned into his mess again and she just tells him she's right here, she's not going anywhere, and that they will fix it together.

And how does the movie end? With Peter alone, having lost everything, including the last two people in his life. The last two people that made him promise to come find them again, who both truly love him, and despite the pain of being with Spider-Man, *wanted* to be with him. It's such a bitter sweet ending. Peter wants them back so badly, but he can't bring himself to hurt them again. So he hurts himself instead by letting them go. He's clearly happy they are happy, which helps take the bitter taste out. Gah I love this movie lol",ri7eum
hovttp6,"Yes but this is exactly who Spider-Man is and what he stands for. He gets the short end of the stick over and over , yet he still does what's right. They fixed all my issues with Tom Holland (he was my least favorite) and now I am so excited to see him move forward. He's faced pain now, lost friends, broke, no one to help him now, and he will still push forward.",ri7eum

Even when Peter Parker gets his happy ending, he doesn't get a happy ending.",ri7eum

hoxin04,">But you feel so fucking sad for the character

True. It's a great ending and return to the classic Spider-Man, but damn did it cost everything to get there. :(",ri7eum
hovvsd2,"I agree for the most part! i've always been a fan of this interpretation of Spidey and usually felt that people calling him white Miles or TS Jr. were missing the more nuanced points of his character. 
I think the end really encapsulated peter's arc over this entire trilogy! He learned to believe in his own powers (Homecoming), rise to (or above) the expectations of others (Far From Home), and finally to make the hard but necessary choices (NWH). 
Having said that, the ending like you said is so sad and great because yeah he lost his aunt and his old friends, but it's also Spidey taking everything he's learned and going off into the world on his own and, hopefully, making new friends. (aka going off to college).",ri7eum
hoxtjgg,"Ikr? I really am hoping that scene meant that he thinks they‚Äôre safer and better off without Spider-Man, because that would be so more bittersweet and poignant to me. That being said, I love MJ and Ned and hope they do come back at the same time.",ri7eum
hoycetd,">That end was so fucking sad but great at the same time. 

I know. I felt like at the donut shop, Ned was about to say, ""Thanks babe!"" to MJ, implying that if Peter didn't exist in their life, they would end up in a relationship. Still could be, but it would have been damn tragic.",ri7eum

hoyunem,"From what I have read, the ending leaves things really depressing despite the bit of hope for Peter's future as Spider-Man at least.

But is Peter a hacker in this universe?  If Peter has to get his GED to attend college (Empire State University likely), how is he going to register for the test.  Did the spell erase his official records and not just the memories of the world.

Perhaps Peter will go by Ben Reilly and dye his hair blond.  New identity and new beginning.",ri7eum

hoyhjbz,Thank goodness they didn't do that shit! I would've flipped.,ri7eum
hp1e15b,"Good point. I really thought they made it that way because of the 3 movie Sony-MCU contract thing is done, so this way it would explain why he won't interact with the Avengers/MCU characters anymore in the next movie(s), but you're right that Happy acknowledged Spiderman in the end...

I wonder why Peter didn't just say that he was May's nephew though. I get that he didn't want Ned and MJ to get hurt, but surely there's no reason for him to cut Happy off too?",ri7eum
hoyzvp9,"Couldn't have said it better myself! Though I would say that i don't think it's a reset, because reset implies that whatever came before is gone... it feels more like a step in a familiar, yet distinctly different direction.",ri7eum

hp15jd5,"It definitely was, up until either Disney buys the marvel characters from Sony or convinces them to loan him again. 

My guess the end of this set of phases (which will coincide with the end of the new spider trilogy) will bring the back together.",ri7eum

hp0syqs,Because Tom Holland is literally talking about retiring his Spider-Man (and taking a break from acting) so he can have spider babies with Zendaya. Definitely likely.,ri7eum

hp5r7r6,Same. Her chemistry with tom holland is insane. her last scenes with got me choked up,ri7eum
hoxggir,"> Something has been missing from this Spider-Man and I think it‚Äôs the Daily Bugle.

It's the feeling of isolation I think, which is what The Daily Bugle intensified.

In the comics he was a nerd with no friends when he was in school, he's in love with MJ who he can't risk getting close to for her own safety (same reason he can't tell anyone he's Spider-Man), he's constantly facing the same daily struggles that regular folk face (money, jobs, day to day responsibilities) etc etc.  On top of that he's a guy trying to do good while the press makes him out to be a menace.

I've really enjoyed the Tom Holland Spider-Man films as funny superhero flicks with fun action set pieces etc, but they've never felt like true Spider-Man films.  He has friends, he was able to ask someone to the prom in his first movie, he's had Tony Stark as a mentor in 4 of his 6 appearances in the MCU so far.

He's never been alone until now and I'm looking forward to what happens next.",ri7eum

hoxsnec,"The FBI (or whoever it was) mentioned Nick Fury being off planet for a year to make it look like Peter was lying about Fury helping him in London. 

The spell was enough to make people in other universes forget Peter, I'd say it's almost a certainty that he's been forgotten by everyone in the mcu. For now at least.",ri7eum
hoy2a23,"This is a good point I didn‚Äôt consider before. The original spell, when strange is casting it, would‚Äôve been everyone *on earth* in his own words.

hoxc7ou,"The general explanation is that they remember spider man, but dont remember peter. Happy knows he met May through Spiderman, but not who was behind the mask or why Spiderman knew May. 

I do think this will come into play in the future. There is now a big Peter Parker shaped hole in the universe, and some of those characters are going to notice it. E.G. MJ and Ned are going to notice that they cant remember everyone on their Academic Decathalon team (maybe a reunion will happen and only 9 people will be there).

I like that he went back on his word and didn't automatically come to the conclusion that he needs people to help balance himself because 1) i think it adds nuance to the character and doesn't just automatically make him like a paragon of virtue! it sets up, like you said, future stories and further character growth stemming from his mistakes. kinda like how Andrew's Spidey went back on his word to Captain Stacey! and 2) i think up until now, MCU Peter has never been at a lack of support. I think his character wouldn't realize how important support/people were until he spent some time being on his own!",ri7eum

The design looks more like [Shuma-Gorath](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/lovecraft/images/8/8d/Shuma-Gorath_8_%28Marvel_Comics%29.jpg/revision/latest/top-crop/width/360/height/450?cb=20190803030842) than [Gargantos](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7S1L9vUUAEG2Ah.jpg) though, so maybe it's a misdirect. 

If we're getting an evil Doctor Strange, there's always the possibility it's not What If Strange, but an alternate universe version of Strange where Strange becomes a version of Shuma Gorath after fighting it in the Cancerverse for so long.

Or maybe they're using Gargantos to set up Atlantis and Namor.",ri7eum

I‚Äôm so glad he was in the movie I loved him catching the brick",ri7eum
hovusg5,He‚Äôs 100% a parody of Alex Jones. Especially since they had him selling crappy supplements.,ri7eum

In Raimiverse he lowkey knew Peter was Spidey",ri7eum

hozsde8,"‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ indirectly he killed may.

Fuck MCU JJJ",ri7eum
hoycgkz,"I think it's more accurate to the comics JJJ, especially the earlier ones. Raimi JJJ was great, but had too many redemptive qualities (which I think is a big problem with a lot of Raimi characters, personally). In the early comics he was truly obsessed and making conspiracies against Spider-Man",ri7eum
hoxg21s,"Yeah, but there's a potential that he's actually vile enough to participate in Scorpion's creation.",ri7eum
hoz1442,"Yeah, in the Raimiverse he literally is willing to die for Peter since he's a man of integrity, he just thinks Spider-Man is a criminal (from his limited POV and his biased perception of the events, probably deservedly). Here I guess you have all the Mysterio fans and enough 'evidence' (which only we know is false) to dislike Spidey, but Jameson's a more all-around arsehole.",ri7eum
hp2tba5,"Its kind of perfect though, no?

You can now reset JJJ's character now that we kind of understand him now. Show his son John going into space and then die piloting his ship back to Earth saving everyone on board. Spider-Man goes to try and rescue him but can't get in but John slips him a recorded message somehow. John dies in the crash leading JJJ to break down on air. Spidey then goes to offer his condolences because of his loss of May. JJJ hears nothing from him lashing out until Spidey hands him the message from John.

John relays that he's thankful for his father and knows he's proud of him but is also proud of his dad. He secretly wanted to defend Spider-Man to him but knew JJJ would never listen. John then says goodbye and thanks Spider-Man in his last moments before it cuts off. Spidey then says JJJ knew once before but a lot happened and reveals his identity to JJJ. JJJ just mutters ""but... you're just a kid?"" as Spidey swings away.

You can then lead to a climactic battle in Times Square with Spidey Vs. Villain. And then you have every single screen around the place light up with JJJ on it who begins *CHEERING* for Spider-Man and gets the crowd everywhere around him cheering for him too giving Spidey a second wind to beat the villain.

Perfect character development. You can even have Spidey swing into JJJ's studio a few minutes after and start swiping things off his desk like pencils, a mug, a case, etc. because Peter's broke as fuck and Spidey swings off like ""thanks, Jameson!"" which can lead back to JJJ's antics of Spidey is a menace but lowkey smiles as the scene ends.",ri7eum

hovrnyi,"In the after credits scene in Venom 2, Venom reveals to Eddie Brock that the symbiotes have a kind of multiversal hivemind and accumulate knowledge from all universes.

howg7xy,"Yeah, I always thought they went way too quickly into Iron Spider territory. Though, where the MCU was at the time and considering the stuff he had to fight it made sense to have him be at that level already. 

This allows them to go a different direction, and allows him to team up with more NYC based superheroes. Considering the after credits scene, i imagine the next movie will be Venom, but I have to wonder who he‚Äôll team up with",ri7eum
hovp6f7,Definitely was cool how they turned the first trilogy into basically an origin story into the Spider-Man we all know and love. Very creative decision.,ri7eum
hovmtjk,I don‚Äôt think Ned will turn into a villain. I think that was just a nod to hobgoblin from the comics but I think since mj and Ned got into mit they‚Äôll move to Boston and the next trilogy will move on from them to a new group of friends.,ri7eum

hp4yh9i,"I was always annoyed by the iron boy comments. I loved his and Tony‚Äôs dynamic for what little was shown and he made a great Uncle Ben-type.

hozlg7g,Destroying Tony's deus ex machina machine at Happy's apartment also helped.,ri7eum

how17y5,"Man I don't know, I loved the movie but absolutely despised the ending. I don't think making everyone forget everything just to have a return to some arbitrary status quo was worth it. Completely undermines everything the characters have been through and makes those first two movies almost feel pointless. Like great he made his own suit and lives in an apartment in New York now. Was completely wiping every Ned, MJ and Happy's relationship with Peter really necessary to get there?",ri7eum
hovtnwf,Will he be a villain?,ri7eum
how8tu5,This is what I always felt they missed out on. I'm looking forward to seeing what comes next.,ri7eum

hoxk53r,"It left things in an interesting place for sure. Spider-man could never be a part of the MCU again, and it would feel just fine.

I think if you're going all-in on the multiverse concept, it's a great opportunity to include cameos from prior Marvel movies (Nick Cage as Ghostrider, Ben Affleck as Daredevil, Hasselhoff as Nick Fury), the Fox characters they now own (both Fantastic Four teams, X-Men, Deadpool), but given that Sony and Marvel/Fox are playing nice, you could really tap into the movie multiverse in general.

I do hope this isn't the last time we see Andrew or Tobey suit up as Spidey, but if it is at least we can say now that they ended their tenures on a high note (instead of the low notes we previously left them on).

Also it's confirmed that OSCORP doesn't exist in the MCU, since Norman Osborne from the Toby-verse said so. Maybe with Tony Stark out of the picture though, the MCU's version of OSCORP will be founded and rise over the next few years.",ri7eum

The only noteworthy character moment here is him being the one to save Norman, which is a very satisfying moment after the regret he felt all those years ago when Norman died.

""This is what we do"" or telling Andrew's Peter that he should try having a normal life again. 

Then we have Andrew.

Remember when Sony tried to separate Spidey before and everyone on Twitter lost it, resulting in them changing their minds? I think this was Sony saying ""too late, it's done lol"".

I just hope without Fiege they can still handle him. Looking at the Venom films and Morbius, they still struggle with superhero movies. Spider-Verse was excellent due to the people working on it (Phil Lord, Christopher Miller as producers especially).

It was a great experience but I didn't enjoy this film as much as others. The overkill in terms of the amount of villains made it weaker in other areas IMO. Homecoming was the strongest film for me if I'm honest - a stripped back story and one primary villain. Far From Home was still great but it juggled a lot more of a story, and the final act got messy. This one had a LOT going on, and fight scenes got really muddled at times for me. I said in another thread that you could've easily lost Sandman and Lizard and it would've probably helped the film.

At first I felt like it had the Spider-Man 3 problem with too many villains, but now I think it's more like Captain America: Civil War. Lots of fanservice that, whilst great, kind of detracted from the main character's story.

It was a big deal for me as a kid, leading up to the movie my dad showed me all of his spiderman comics and when we were in the theater he whispered bits of spiderman trivia to me throughout the movie.

Almost 20 years later, I'm in the theater with my dad and younger brother. That portal opens and I get to be the one who whispers ""that's not Tom Holland's suit"" and they're both confused before the Garfield reveal. It was fun to be the one that ""knew something"" that my family didn't 2 decades later.",ri7eum
hovivmo,"I think my theater had more big cheers for this than Endgame did. For Endgame I remember Cap catching the spear, hammer, avengers assemble, and I am Iron Man. Daredevil, Ock, Goblin, Peter 2, Peter 3, I'm something of a scientist myself, the three spiderman leaping at the baddies, them swinging in unison after figuring out how to work, Peter 3 catching MJ, and finally Ock grabbing Electro, all massive cheers.

howqwv4,"I don't remember the last time I've been in a theater with this amazing a crowd reaction. Avengers: Endgame was great, but it really only had it at the end with the obvious hero moment. Before that, maybe when I saw Snakes on a Plane and everyone already knew Jackson's famous line and joined in when he finally said it :D

But this film had like 5-6 of those ""whole theater erupting in cheers and/or gasps"" moments. The lawyer scene seemingly really surprised _everyone_, you could tell this was truly shocking by people's reactions. Then Ned's first portal, and people immediately figured out what might be happening, and then went absolutely nuts once Garfield's bigger, broader physique in the suit became apparent.

It was just such a perfect movie-going experience, it's so rare these days to have everyone be equally surprised at something happening in a film.",ri7eum
hoxkith,Dude sitting next to me called it the first moment he saw him. Pretty sure he was the first one in the theatre to see it. I was still in the mindset of ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs Tom‚Äôs Spider-Man‚Äù,ri7eum

hovbgrb,He was really fantastic. I always loved him in those movies. The problem was pretty much everything around him.,ri7eum
hovef0r,I love how Andrew's Peter is very enthusiastic and cheeky yet jovial personality in contrast to Tobey's Peter's reserved and level-headed nature. Just love seeing their interactions on screen.,ri7eum

hovccg5,At the school!! Yes what a striking image,ri7eum
hovhg7f,Really reminded me of Darkman,ri7eum
hovleg8,"It does get a bit messy to think about their timelines. You have multiple characters ripped out of different points of their respective timelines, so each one returning must go to branched timelines now. 

That is to say that Maguire's Parker must be going to a timeline where both Osborn and Octavius is dead, Octavius goes back to a timeline where only Osborn is dead, and Osborn returns to a timeline where everyone lives happily ever after (his son Harry would never become the next Green Goblin and would live on as Pete's best friend).",ri7eum
hovkl8q,"This is truly a cinematic masterpiece. I'm kinda upset they didn't use vulture or scorpion from the first movie, maybe a redemption for vulture and mysterio and setup scorpion for future movies or bring back mysterio as a ""haha gotcha"" moment since each Spider-Man had their respective villains in the movie but other than that this is truly the best live action Spider-Man Movie ever and tops even Infinity War and Endgame.

howb32n,yeah it's fucked.  The only alternative is they inexplicably get zapped into the 2021 versions of their multiverse (since it's never really explained why the two Peters are from 2021)... in which case it would be like they had been blipped for 10-20 years and were all in a future version of their worlds they didn't understand.

hox4whx,"For me it was Cap picking up Mjolnir. That was probably the loudest audience cheer/applause I ever experienced in the theater. The two runner ups and previous holder of that title was Avengers 1 when Hulk smashes Loki.

how2nhc,"They really did a good job of connecting him with what makes Peter Peter in spite of the superficial differences in this. He's insecure, unable to forgive himself, completely isolated, clearly barely holding it together.

how2s58,"It also totally works on another level with it basically showing how Peter doesn't totally love himself. Part of him does but part of him always seems to go back to the idea that he is not deserving of love. It's telling that 2/3 of them couldn't say it and in the end, Peter seems to decide with Ned and MJ that he doesn't deserve them.

It wouldn't be as funny but a bit more thematically appropriate if it was Mcguire who said that line though since he's the only one who seems at peace while Andrew and Tom are much more guilt ridden.",ri7eum

Sometimes it's like Peter never existed but then Happy knows May ""through Spiderman"" but how does May know Spiderman? and the diner scene where Ned and MJ are pals, clearly just had an adventure with Spider-man but probably don't remember why. He's moving boxes into his new apt, but is it his stuff from his room at his Aunt's house... an Aunt who, if alive would suddenly not know the person living in her apt? Would May remember she had a nephew? Him taking the GED supposes that no one with the name Peter Parker is enrolled in HS. And it also presumes that he altar to PP/SPiderman at his school isnt there any more?? If Happy knows Spiderman, he's gotta still is part of the Avengers and has access to the Stark Tech. Just not Peter? This plot device makes too many assumptions that have to all be accepted and simultaneously not accepted for what we've been shown to be possible.The more I think about it the more it bothers me.",ri7eum

howcacu,"This completely confused me. I know it‚Äôs a superhero/comic book movie so it doesn‚Äôt need to have 100% cohesive logic for the movie to work but how exactly does every other characters relationship with Spider-Man/Peter Parker work if they don‚Äôt know that he‚Äôs Peter Parker. He has a lot of ‚Äúunmasked‚Äù scenes as Spider Man in past films of the MCU, so does that mean those scenes never happened? How exactly do the scenes involving Spider Man in films like Civil War/Infinity War/Endgame play out according to other characters that interacted with him in the MCU? Also the spell seems to also have erased Peter Parker existence as regular person. He had a GED booklet in his moving box so that means he clearly has no high school record. Does that mean he doesn‚Äôt have a birth certificate anymore? Does that mean there‚Äôs no record of Peter Parker ever existing as a human being? He has no extended family? It made me feel extremely bad for Peter Parker, but also made me question the entire logic of his existence moving forward.",ri7eum
howh9ih,"I kinda like that more. That's always what he was supposed to be. Ultimate Peter was so pissed that one time the X-Men took off his mask. I can't wait to see that protective over his identity, it'd be tremendous growth from that time he revealed his secret identity to Doctor Strange literally the first chance he got.",ri7eum

If they want to do their own Holland movies, they'll have to pull him into their own Venom/Sinister Six universe, which sounds kinda stupid...",ri7eum

After the events of F4, Dr. Victor will become the next avengers villain and due to his smarts and ability to use magic, make Ned as his apprentice.

He and MJ are making things work despite it being complicated, which I took to mean that they're just doing their best to balance his personal life with his hero life. But he's learned all the lessons he needed to and is now just content to spend his days being a seasoned hero keeping the streets of NYC safe. We don't need to throw any more supervillains at him.

Garfield's Spidey definitely has more potential though and I think it'd be a good idea to continue his storyline. Somehow find a way to get Tom Hardy's Venom into his world and then move forward with that being its own cinematic universe, where only Spider-Man related heroes/villains appear.

It was cool to see Carnage for a bit, but other than that‚Ä¶what a boring movie. It‚Äôs the same situation as Andrew Garfield. Give Tom Hardy a good script as Eddie Brock and he‚Äôd be fantastic. Him and Venoms banter is the best thing about those movies.",ri7eum
hoxexuk,"I still insist Hardy's performance in Venom 1 & 2 is a more interesting bit of character acting than damn near anything in the MCU. It's manic, it's depraved, and it's just a goddamn blast to watch. He's playing a romantic comedy against himself, and has such a perfect realization of what the character is. A damn shame that this movie chickens out on giving him a bigger playground.",ri7eum

Who else could have came through but just didn't happen to be in NY when they switched universes?,ri7eum
hoymhtw,all of this is messy IMHO.  Is every meaningful interaction with Peter just rewritten somehow?  Or did they just happen with the mask on instead of off?  It really gets confusing and problematic as far as the events of the MCU go.  How important was anyone having a relationship with Peter vs Spiderman to the results of these interactions?  Would the other Avengers had trusted him as a mysterious web slinging masked guy?,ri7eum

hoxrarl,"> Peter wouldn‚Äôt be in the yearbook though.

Of course he would. He just had a spell cast to have people forget him. Not full on existence erasure. The idea that Peter Parker is no longer in the Social Security database and that he has no documented history **at all** is absurd. The consequences would be monumental. He'd never be able to take the GED, let alone get into any future college. No job as he would look sketchy as hell. No apartment because they can't run a background check. The Feds would be down on him since he's a bureaucratic ghost, which clearly means he's foreign espionage and they need to bring him in for questioning. 

Like I said, this is simply one of the multitude of things in the MCU you have to be hand-wavey about and brush off. The second you try and pick apart anything in this franchise of movies the house of cards would crumble. Instead you just have to roll with it and enjoy the ride. Can't be a slave to continuity. They can get away with it where *most* others don't simply because, at the end of the day, their movies are fun, engaging and entertaining and not meant for hard lined objective nitpickery.",ri7eum

Norman's mental issues *were caused* by the same gas he used to make himself superhuman.

Only ones who's mentalities might not have been overtly effected by their powers were Elektro and Sandman. And Elektro mainly felt  weak, ignored and ostracized. And his power making him look like a freak boosted that even more.

It takes a lot of effort and proof checking to make a good movie. If I can find so many loopholes after watching once, then that is a poorly made movie, in this sense.

I dislike how they ridiculed Dr strange just to create a plot. Strange is supposed to be the wisest of them all, is/was sorcerer supreme, and literally engineered the entire battle against Thanos which saved the universe.

That would imply there is a correct way to interpret art. A bit confused by that comment but perhaps I'm misunderstanding you and I'm going to assume I am. 

Back to the film villains, so like, essentially exactly what I said with the Starbucks thing? The movie shows a bunch of shots after the villains turn evil again of a chilled out NYC with nothing out of the ordinary happening but also wants me to accept that these villains are dangerous, homicidal maniacs? I'm just taking what the film is giving me dude, if they're not going to make the villains appropriately threatening in any way I'm not just going to assume how dangerous they are. Not like it's something that hasn't been done before, Raimi did plenty good @ making the Goblin/Doc Ock threat serious. 

Strange can punch people out of their physical body but apparently you just do some breaststrokes to counter it? I would be able to believe it if I didn't watch this same wizard go toe to toe with Thanos in a previous Marvel film. Maybe I'm missing something and Spidey can actually fuck with Strange from the comics or something but it seemed more like a plot contrivance to have Spidey win based on what we know about their power level in the MCU. Also just in general Strange acts way too dumb for his character in this movie.

""I think the script was brilliant considering we got Holland movie 3,   
original Spider-Man 4, Amazing Spider-Man 3, AND the Sinister 6 all in   
one film."" And I think this movie just kind of shows why you don't need this much shit going on in one movie if it's not going to give itself 3hr runtime, 2 parts, w/e. There was just too much going on and not enough time (Covid, runtime) to do it. Perfectly acceptable to sell tickets and toys which seemed to the film's main goal more than anything but yeah...it didn't culminate into a meaningful narrative to me. Which is all the more disappointing because I feel like Raimi was doing more with these characters almost 2 decades ago.

I really hope that it is not your actual opinion that these movies are not ""serious"" after watching a masterpiece in character dynamic and development such as civil war with its extremely complex and rich storyline and characters. Maybe 20 years ago, but absolutely not today. The bar has been raised exponentially by the MCU and this is evident in most of their work from the past 10 years, including the very first iron man,  captain america etc. The whole point of the MCU was to lift these characters and stories out of the ""just a comic book and not serious"" stigma and to portray the brilliance that made them popular in the first place in a more mature and nuanced manner.",ri7eum

It was definitely a fun time, don't get me wrong, but I feel like it had a little too much fun with itself to the point where it starts dragging. A little too much fan service. Like you said, the plot and pacing are all over the place.

Soon after all the villains show up, they very quickly become the butt of all the jokes, especially Ock. They even have him and Gobby quoting their own memes. Then once the other two Peters arrive, we get *maybe* once profound scene of them exchanging experiences that shaped their moral compasses, then the rest of their time on screen is spent discussing the possibility of webs coming out of Tobey Maguire's butt.

In the big climactic battle, all it takes is one quick conversation for them to figure out how to work together when we could have spent more time with that. It feels like they tried to cram two movies into one here. There's the SpiderVerse movie, but then there's what I believe was supposed to be the initial plot before they decided to do the multiverse thing which was to have May killed by a villain (Kraven?) and Peter wants to kill him while also having the entire world watch him. That would have been an interesting movie on its own.

Also smaller nitpicks include Strange being nerfed yet again, there's no way Peter's spidey sense can pull him out of being astral projected. I also feel like they don't fully explain what their ""cure"" does to the villains. Is it taking away their powers? Is it magically making them good again? How is that going to prevent them from dying? Maybe I missed a line between all the jokes and wondering where the plot was going, who knows.

That said, there are a lot of great smaller moments, a lot of cool callbacks, and the jokes are usually pretty good even if they overstay their welcome. It was a fun movie, but overall it's probably not a great one.",ri7eum
hp9nx53,"It's like Endgame for me--the fanservice probably obscures a lot of what doesn't work for me, but there's still plenty that does. Honestly what I love is that the villains and Spideys have a purpose--it's a movie about how Peter's defining attribute is his willingness to try and fight for the good in people, even when they're apparently irredeemable. The villains prove that and the other Spideys help him remember that when he almost forgets. I think the way they pulled that off is more than fanservice, it's legitimately heart-wrenching and powerful.

*Buuuut* the ""fanservicy"" element comes out in just how many callbacks there are. Like of course MCU watchers are used to that, but imagine watching this far into the series and realizing in order to get everything you also need to have watched the five other Spider-Man movies (which includes some real stinkers--and excludes one of the best ones which was animated).

If Nostalgia and Dumb Fan Service are what you think makes a movie good then maybe. The fact this whole movie wouldn‚Äôt have happened if Spider-Man just told Strange to make everyone forget Mysterio instead is just one of the many things that prove how stupid it was.

Aside from the garbage Doomsday battle, the directors cut of BvS is so above this movie in every way that it‚Äôs almost even laughable and I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs anything higher than a 6/10.


But it‚Äôs fine because i predict that what happened to force awakens where everyone was loving it at first then turned on it completely months later after finally seeing the lazy, nostalgia bait crap it was is exactly what will happen to this movie but worse so because at least force awakens plot and characters were good despite just being a rip off of the original, this movies plot is atrocious and all of the  non mcu characters are barely even characters, they just bring them from completely unrelated franchises and stick them in the movie then give them some dumb mcu humour lines and call it a day. Imagine if in Justice League they just randomly dropped Arnold Schwarzenegger‚Äôs Mr Freeze as a main villain and then used 4 line exposition to summarise his backstory from the previous unrelated franchise he was in, everyone would flame the hell out of it but that‚Äôs exactly what this movie is getting praised for lmao.

> They actually managed to improve on Electro from his previous outing.

Why because they turned him into Jamie Foxx playing himself in a jacket? The characterisation of the character was totally off and made no sense in comparison to how he was in TASM. As someone below pointed out, he made a stupid mcu style joke about someone looking like a dnd character when he himself is supposed to be a big nerd lol


Or I love how Holland‚Äôs Spider-Man calls Willem Dafoe ‚ÄúGreen Goblin‚Äù or something when he turns evil despite the fact that the character has never appeared in the mcu and there‚Äôs no mention of that name by anyone to Holland before hand in reference to Dafoe.


Or wait I also love how the spell is only supposed to pull in people who know Peter is Spidey but Electro and Venom are sucked in as well despite neither knowing this from their movies lmao. 

The movie is a gigantic mess in every sense of that word. Even the way the other 2 spideys first met Holland was weird, dude saw them for the first time and was acting like they‚Äôve met before and everything is normal.

All the things people roasted BvS for: Muddled motivations, inconsistent characterisation, disjointed plot, nonsensical story beats etc are in this movie to a fucking T yet it‚Äôs sitting in the 90‚Äôs on RT and you still want to tell me people aren‚Äôt insanely biased towards marvel, lol.

People were crying about Batman killing because ‚Äúit‚Äôs not what he does!‚Äù Yet everyone is silent when flint Marco who was shown to be a good guy at the end of SM3 is willingly working with a guy who he knows kills innocent people for no reason and is fighting the Peter from his own universe even after seeing he‚Äôs a good man at the end of SM3 as well.

Oh how convenient lmao. He wasn‚Äôt too crazy to make dumb jokes about dungeons and dragons though lol

Electro had no reason to oppose it and neither did sandman who didn‚Äôt even like or want his powers in SM3. All of a sudden green goblin makes some speech about nothing being wrong with any of them then they all flip out and go out to cause mayhem lmao

So let‚Äôs say for some strange reason he‚Äôs just been able to maintain this innocence the entire time. If that‚Äôs the case then why would Stark trust him with so much stuff knowing he‚Äôs like 15-16 at the time or giving it to him? The dude handed Spidey some stuff that he just handed over to Mysterio that you wouldn‚Äôt normally give to a 16-17 year old. So we‚Äôre just gonna say he‚Äôs still a kid then? If we know that then why doesn‚Äôt anyone in the universe know that and these guys are legit super intelligent beings INCLUDING Spider-Man?

If you‚Äôre 17 how is MIT as important to you as an event like the Mysterio one?

I feel like the age thing is a cop out that seemingly only applies to this one spidey. Every other spidey had to learn about responsibility before actually being responsible while this spidey‚Äôs journey is backwards. He had to do responsible things without ever learning responsibility

Holland‚Äôs Spidey was treated way better than the others which is why the Aunt May‚Äôs death was forced. He needed to experience true loss to be considered one of the guys. And when you think about it‚Ä¶Aunt May‚Äôs death was just forced

So some random villains show up and she guilt trips him into saving them, and for what reason?

Sandman has no reason to fight the Spidermen, at all

Electro has no reason to be a completely different character

Every returning character is flanderized and I seriously doubt the writers have even seen the original movies. 

It is not Peters responsibility to fix anyone, nor does it make sense to not keep them locked up until he atleast has the cures. 

Peter is dumber then ever and Strange is just as dumb to make huge decisions for a teenage kid. No reason for Peter to continually mess with the spell when he could literally use Strange as proof that they at one point knew he was Spiderman. 

Wouldn‚Äôt the spell at the end count for the other Peters? It obviously did for the first spell

Why doesn‚Äôt Peter just stay with Ned and MJ and try to explain instead of leaving?

What was the point of even stabbing Tobey? Seriously if your just going to make a joke of it don‚Äôt bother. 

It‚Äôs really uninspired how the villains are shoved into an apartment building or how Tobey and Garfield just show up in the kitchen.

All the jokes are low hanging fruit. They count for a laugh but after that they‚Äôre completely tone ruining. Making fun of Harry in a way makes no sense. 

Retconning everyone knowing Norman was Goblin is unnecessary, serves no purpose, and ruins Harry‚Äôs arc in Spiderman 2 just so they can have the shittiest exposition scene in the movie.

From a production perspective. I think they kept Andrew and Garfield at small locations like Ned's House, the school rooftop&lab, and the Statue of Liberty to try to remove any leaks of their involvement in the project. They could work with smaller crews in those environments. Which helps with secrecy and Covid considerations. Though the secret still got leaked in the end.

The best part of this film was the villains as it seems to be them who really carry the film. They needed more time or a better purpose. We got a sinister six tease in some sense. However, why wasn't the idea that since these guys are from another universe, that they cannot die in Hollands and thus do not want to do back. Even Doc Ock, the whole chasing ghosts line should come at the revelation of their death and then they say ""fuck this noise"". however the twist is that the Holland Spiderman cannot kill them and they cannot kill him, regardless of physical injury. Yet, there can be things worse than death. In the end they cannot be saved for even if they are, they just are going to die. This brings in the other two Peter Parkers via whatever who have to correct things with their own universe. The problem that should have happened is that the Spidermen succeed in the goal of the villains meeting their fate, however since they did it in Hollands Universe, this causes the multiverse to rupture because they were to go back instead. The rupture causes energy to come out that destroys the other two spidermen. and then it is clear what is happening, the spell to make people forget about whatever, it became so corrupted that it is erasing those people, as peter looks down at a whatever of energy, ned is vaporized... peter not wanting MJ to die begs Strange to change the spell, and Peter asks for him to be taken/removed/vaporized instead. he is, Strange is moved by this sacrifice as this saves basically the entire world who is now aware that he was Spiderman. Peter is gone, spiderman is gone, no one remembers him as Strange just sees this kid kind of vaporize in front of him as he completes his spell. 

the world is safe, the multiverse has been opened, and the spiderman story is done...

The entire movie could be adrenaline pumping fun. Venom after Spider-man. Spider-man realizing what Toby-Spider said that he fought an alien black goo before. Deadpool plays very loud Celine Dion music and that makes Venom retreat. Deadpool tries to befriend Spider-man to get information on that Venom guy. Kraven accidentally mistakes Deadpool for Spider-man (similar color schemes) and shoots him. Kraven goes after Spider-man. Venom sees Deadpool is temporarily out, but who's this new guy? Venom vs Kraven. Kraven takes a pic and asks his underworld hitman app ""How much for this guy?"" Deadpool replies with ""Get your own, Crocodile DunDon't. He's already mine!""  


And that's all I got for now. Kraven has to set up multiple lethal traps throughout the city. Eddie and Peter talk. Deadpool walks in like he just caught them in bed together.",ri7eum

I know I‚Äôm the minority in this thread, but we‚Äôve seen two failed attempts at live screen Peter. I personally like Hollands take the best with how they incorporated him into the MCU. Granted my preferred Spider-Man overall is The Animated Series version (nostalgia reasons).",ri7eum
hqotij6,"I haven‚Äôt seen Far From Home since the theater release so I could be off. However it still strips everything they built in both movies. In the first film while Peter messes up and Tony tells him he wants him to be better and be his own, it still doesn‚Äôt negate the fact he is given access to Karen and later Edith. 

The hero redemption story they already did in Homecoming where he has to rely on himself and does the whole comic book water reflection scene. The need to strip him of becoming the next person to fill the role of Stark, I find this plot useless if TH Spider-Man is slated for another trilogy within the MCU. In No Way Home, you see him attempt to help similar to pitfall of Tony & Bruce making Ultron. Peter in the MCU mirrors his mentor and entirely strip that is shit imo. 

Ironman 3 ending showed Stark thinking and acting like he didn‚Äôt need or want the suit anymore and later shown to finance things to only go right back. I don‚Äôt think we needed Peter to do the same. Granted the next film might retcon all this but who knows. 

 He can still the be friendly neighborhood Spider-Man and have access to all the Stark tech and hopefully make Peter Industries. He would still be the superhero who doesn‚Äôt forget his roots and stays local.

Tobey and Andrew while I love them ofc kinda just felt they were there because the studious saw how much money they could make from nostalgia, not for a genuine story they wanted to tell.

hpk1dmm,"Hmmm...what you say makes sense but also doesn't entirely click for me.

1. Wouldn't they still be getting sent back to the moment of their deaths (from where they were taken) to the Peter Parkers who weren't pulling their punches, and die anyway? I think it might make more sense to help them make peace with their deaths (since it was their fate and it was their natural end)rather than risk more people getting pulled in to this universe and causing whatever bigger problems Dr Strange feared would happen. So I suppose this is explained by Point 4. But is May like that too? And does it mean Peter never learns that with great power comes great responsibility? If so, he really might be a menace like Jamieson says.
2. One the one hand I get wanting to help someone you come across than sending them off as another universe's problem. However, there's no reason to believe the other universe WON'T help them (and it wasn't for lack of the Peters of their universes trying) especially considering time may be of essence to prevent instabilising the multiverse or whatever and cause graver problems for everyone. Isn't this more of a selfish saviour complex of I, me and myself has to be the saviour (and in fact only I possibly can because everyone else are horrible) so I can feel like a nice person, rather than focusing on getting them the help they could get even if from someone/somewhere else when time is of essence? Not saying May is that kind of person, but I still felt the execution of the idea of her helping-mentality felt off to me. Essentially, I feel like they tried to make a trolley problem out of this - except the people on one of the tracks is already dead.",ri7eum

They should have shown the GG sabotaging the work or something because it made no sense what he was injected with

And I get that peter was going for the killshot this time but still, spider man gave some pretty good punches in the first fight but it didn't seem to affect GG at all and GG went from throwing a guy through concrete floors to just being the easiest guy to fight

hqyw0dx,"Agreed. I will get downvoted into oblivion but fuck it, my opinion stands.",ri7eum
hqyvt8j,"Nostalgia was the only thing it had going for it IMO.  The best part of the entire movie was when the 3 different spider men were making jokes etc.

They gave Toby( who in my opinion was the best spiderman ever ) awful lines and made him look like trash when he's one of the best actors in that movie besides the green goblin who also carried the whole villain side of things. I just can't say enough how bad Tom Holland and Zendaya are in this movie. I spent like half the time rolling my eyes at how lame/bad their acting was including their love. It felt Hollow AF to me. 

The battles they had were forgettable, the writing was all over the place( also the pacing was terrible, one moment was sad and slow, and bam right back into action). The acting was also terrible, I could have cared less if MJ died and they really did not make me care or feel for any of the other characters. 

I also was not a fan of them saving these villains who did terrible things and literally are dead men walking, the whole plot is meh.

I really wish that we could look more into Manga and Anime from Japan. The writing and sense of detail they do is incredible and I don't see marvel or sony ever getting close to making something as incredible as (JJK, One Piece, Demon slayer, ETC ETC ETC.) 

Look, my point is I felt like this movie was just a Fan Service and money grab. They only included the other spidermen so they could make more money, and they did. It's fine if you enjoyed it, I know a lot of people did sadly I was not one of those people.",ri7eum

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre with you Peter.‚Äù That‚Äôs an adult thing too; it‚Äôs called accepting the conditions if you want to keep doing a certain activity. So no; this is selfish of him. This isn‚Äôt him wanting to not sledgehammer with Ned and MJs fragile lives , this is Peter not being a grown up and not accepting that people are gonna die all the time when you be a hero but that‚Äôs the burden of being the hero and you have to live with that burden. 

That‚Äôs the responsibility thing of being a hero; also who the fuck is Peter to make a choice of these two people and their own demise.

Like... he just betrayed his promise for no reason. The LOGICAL thing would have just been to wait with everyone atop the Statue of Liberty in the Spidey suit, when they were ALREADY going to find themselves in a confusing, scary situation no knowing what had happened but WERE aware of Spider-Man, and say ""hey guys, here's what just happened."" Why would he need to say ""I'll find you"" anyway if she's right there and needs him?

9/10, I can watch a movie and tell you what‚Äôs going to happen next. I can pick out little pieces of foreshadowing that tells you who is gonna go bad and who is gonna die and who is gonna live.

I think a good comparison is like seeing a video of a dude building a telescope with chocolate. The title of the video tells you what‚Äôs gonna happen. It‚Äôs watching that build process that is what I find interesting as fuck.",ri7eum
how4pqa,Yes I was saying they could have still introduced Andrews goblin and it wouldn't have taken his moment away from saving MJ. I just felt the climax needed more oomph and I honestly think two goblins fighting the Spidermen while they gun for MJ would have raised the stakes and help Andrew find more closure.

And Tobey and Andrew would show up for something different, like multiverse of madness or a later spiderverse thing. I‚Äôm pretty good at keeping myself away from spoilers it seems, I realize, and this was a refreshing pay off.

I realize how much care they put in not spoiling their movie and I‚Äôm loving it. The 2 spideys are not in the official cast (not even on this post), and there were several important aspects completely left out of the trailers (like details about the cast alteration, etc). I like how fat they go for this",ri7eum

hoyuu8d,I understand that‚Äôs what the spell did and I know there‚Äôs that beat at the graveyard where Peter maybe thinks Happy might know him but then that tension is settled when Happy doesn‚Äôt address Peter directly.

I still think the timing is a bit off, though, because wasn't Doc Ock liberated from the control of his arms just before he learned who Spider-Man was? Anyway, that still makes a ton more sense than what I was thinking.

The second part, though, are you saying that the other two Spider-Men weren't even in the MCU world until Ned used the ring? Because Andrew Garfield said that he had been looking for Tom Holland ever since he got there, if I remember correctly, so wouldn't he have already been there?",ri7eum
hq7g8dg,The spidey's were already in the world. Ned just made a portal to where they were. We know this because Tobey says how he's been looking all over for them and gives reason to why he would just walk into the portal.,ri7eum

You kind of forget Tom is so angry especially considering he‚Äôs still been talking about helping the green goblin and working through his pain with the other spidermen. I think they should have had him not know if MJ is alive at that point just so there‚Äôs a reason to escalate it back to that point.

Unless you aren't using the 616 versions of Spider-man or these respect threads ([Spider-man](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/cjhe01/respect_peter_parker_the_amazing_spiderman_marvel/) & [Thor](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/byxdjh/respect_thor_marvel_616/)) are missing all the best Spider-man feats. I don't see how Spider-man can compete with Thor, even without Mj√∂lnir. Spidey can lift around 100 Tons while Thor can lift Planets, his striking feats also dwarf Spidey's. This seems to be the case in pretty much every category. Maybe MCU Thor is below Comics Spider-man, but when comparing comic versions it seems skewed heavily towards Thor. Am I missing something?",ri7eum

I honestly never get the feeling that MCU Spidey is that strong, if you ask me, Holland's Spidey seems a bit weaker compared to Tobey and Garfield.",ri7eum
hpzcyx3,"The real reason they did this was because during preproduction, Sony and Disney were unsure if they can come to a renewal of a contract agreement for the character. The plot of No Way Home was written to allow writers to write Spider-Man out of the MCU if need be.

There was an element of the scene in the donut shop where Peter looked almost happy that MJ and Ned were back to their calm normal lives and they got into MIT like he wanted.

Peter didn't seem depressed or angry that he was alone. He was content with choosing his life of Spiderman over his life as Peter Parker. Dr. Strange was right that the problem was he was trying to live 2 different lives and he needed to choose.

He chose his new life and now he's ready for a fresh start.",ri7eum

hqd6kw1,"It was a close to twenty years long (in real time), beloved marriage that was ended to save Aunt May and retroactively made it so Pete and MJ were never married in the first place, making people feel like years of stories they loved were essentially negated. It was a slap in the face, and it was also very poorly handled, so much so that the writer at the time didn't even want his name on the book (so the rumor goes). It was very much an order from editorial, not the writer's choice. There was no desire for this on the fan level, either. Fans were actually more willing to let Peter live without May at this point. He was established in a career as a teacher, had his marriage, etc. Having Peter lose May as a late twenty-something or early thirty-something felt more appropriate to many fans at the time.

It's easier to forget Peter Parker than it is to forget Spider-Man.

There's no reason Peter would know any of that, though.",ri7eum

It really sucked to feel pulled out of the story and forced to see this piece of art from the perspective of greedy, money grubbing executives playing games with a beloved character in one of the best movies they've made for him. If they did that the character would be dead, as far as I'm concerned. Given Sony's painful mediocrity with their other properties lately, the best we could hope for would be a sad, hollow husk of a Spiderman movie, meant only to rake that sweet sweet box office money into Sony's pockets.

hovr6nz,"> I honestly love that the central conflict of the movie focused on rehabilitating the villains and not letting them go to their deaths.

I can't help but feel like it was a deliberate story choice too tbh; I know one of the complaints about the Raimi films was that they kept killing off the biggest villains of Spidey's rogues gallery. This movie felt like it was trying to reconcile that.",ri7eum

how1yri,"But also an insanely reckless thing to do. Leading villains with a pretty bloody track record outside was crazy dangerous. If goblin killed any people when he the his bombs, those deaths are on both Peter and May.

I really liked the movie but I wasn't sold at all by May's ""they trust you to do the right thing"" mantra.

Not sending the villains home right away was an act that could have, and for all we know *did* lead to multiple completely innocent deaths. Are the lives of the people killed by a goblin bomb not worth as much as goblin's?",ri7eum

hp045q5,"Not exactly. Norman Osborn, regular tycoon, is a ruthless asshole who cheated and framed people. The Goblin is a reckless psychotic. 'Weak' Norman is like a little boy in a man's body, the little boy who his father used to lock in a shed full of crawling insects.",ri7eum

I was bummed we never saw the deleted scene of him beating the shit out of Harry, really glad they updated us on his trauma.

They couldn't use Toby or Garfield in that scene and they probably didn't want to use a random actor because it might confuse the audience into thinking that there was going to be a different Spider-man in the Venom universe, etc.

Honestly, if there's no better explanation it was a cool moment at the end of Let there Be Carnage but still feels clumsy.

Seeing all three Spideys hype each other up was so wholesome, and it shows that Spidey fans can transcend whatever movie franchise or iteration Spider-Man shows up in. We all love the wall-crawling, web-slinging superhero and I'm glad the actors and characters get praise. Garfield felt like a more raw, hurt Spidey who ended up in a harsh place (and still is).

a) go back and die
b) fight against spiderman and WIN - he stays in this dimension where his daughter doesn‚Äôt exist 
c) fight against spiderman and LOSE - dies, or spiderman doesn‚Äôt let him back home, or pray for forgiveness
d) help spiderman and get home 

I don‚Äôt understand why under any reasoning he wouldn‚Äôt pick option D. It‚Äôs the only one that actually gives him a shot at seeing his daughter. 

Also isn‚Äôt he a good person after Spiderman 3? So why is he teaming up with bad guys? I just don‚Äôt get it at all.",ri7eum
hovgw3v,You'd think he'd just immediately make a play for the box then. He doesn't lose his powers and gets sent back to face no real consequences compared to the villains facing death.

One of his first appearances is on TV ranting about Spider-Man just like in the MCU.

hovo6j6,"Exactly. This movie really felt like Tom Holland's origin story. The gripe I've always had about MCU Spidey was that he feels like the character, but his mythos doesn't feel like the Spider-Man mythos. His two movies, he's overshadowed by mentor figures, he has all his tech handed to him from Stark, he's living this happy life in a nice apartment with Aunt May in Queens, we never see him going through genuine loss, struggle and adversity like we saw Maguire and Garfield both go through. 

Peter is supposed to be this lonely and depressing dude who loses his uncle, loses Gwen Stacy, loses his best friend Harry, and just lives broke and alone in a super shitty apartment in the city where all he really has to look forward to in his depressing life is MJ. 

That's why I love Into the Spider-Verse, the core of the movie is about how all the Spider figures across all timelines go through loss and have super depressing stories that they manage to overcome. We finally have that now with Holland, only it took Aunt May to become his Uncle Ben.",ri7eum
hovuo5j,It's funny but the comics actually have the same sort of take on it. When Peter had all the money he needed he specifically designed multiple devices that pretty much countered instantly all of the enemies he had struggled with in the past.,ri7eum

hp078rt,"I realised that when he easily defeated Otto at the start. It took all the threat out of perhaps the most threatening villain from the Raimi movies.

how6icw,"I don't think they'll move on that much from that group.



The ending is pretty depressing, but the main takeaway is that MJ is owed one 'I love you too' from Peter, while Peter also promised Ned that everything will be back to normal and they'll remember him. They won't leave that ending open ended. 



Also, the way the coffee cup(from the shop where MJ works at)sits at his table in the end is a clever way to say that he will be back for her. I definitely don't think that they're done.

In the Pete comics Ned Leeds works at the Bugle and is married to Betty Brandt. At one point he becomes the Hobgoblin. But he's not Pete's best friend and doesn't know he's SM.  Also having aunt May know his identity, and working with Shield and getting tech from Shield/Tony. And yes the ""pale version"" was my attempt at a joke.",ri7eum

Those memories are gone forever, they might not even become friends again without their shared histories. Would they still consent to their earlier request knowing and feeling the things they do now? Does he have a right to decide to let them be happy without him, even if they said not to?

The movie was about conflicting desires. Peter doesn't want to sacrifice anything to change the world at first, he just wants to magic his problems away. He agrees to give them up after May's death and the conversation with the Spider-Man Squad made him realize he had to go on, but that everyone he loves will be in danger ny associating with him. He can't keep dragging then into fights and not expecting a dinosaur to attack them or for them to be flung off buildings. 

Peter rejects those closest to him because he's hurt. He is in unimaginable pain, and he's choosing to grieve by pushing others away and carrying the burden himself. It may not be healthy, but its natural and relatable. The movie also forces all of the villains to accept a cure against their will, because it's for the greater good.

They also have a name-drop moment where they give one of the Spider-Men their real-world adjective, which can easily transition into a useful disambiguation, without the problem of everyone thinking of themselves as the same identifier.

hovqclh,"I totally remember people not liking Garfield's Peter, but loving his Spider-Man. His Peter for some was too hipster-ish?",ri7eum
hoyy8zk,"There‚Äôs a weird meta-narrative about how they portrayed Tobey and Andrew and how it reflects on their respective Spider-Man movies.

Tobey‚Äôs movies were a different generation of Spider-Man. He‚Äôs older and wiser - his Peter had already dealt with the traumas of losing friends/Uncle Ben and the enemies he tried to save but couldn‚Äôt. But he‚Äôs grown in his absence, and his lines imply him and MJ are still in a loving relationship together. His movies ended a long time ago, and regardless of the Raimi Spider-Man 4 never happening his story more or less ended cleanly and with closure. 

Andrew‚Äôs movies never got that closure. TASM2 ended with the death of Gwen and the setup of the Sinister Six for a third movie that never happened. He never got his chance to redeem himself, and he‚Äôs basically trapped in an emotional (and narrative) rut he couldn‚Äôt get himself out of. He never dated after Gwen because his Peter quite literally never got the chance to because his story never got to continue.

And now we have Holland‚Äôs Peter, the youngest of the trio. He‚Äôs had his major fights, he helped save half the universe, and his mistakes (ex: the death of Mysterio), but he hasn‚Äôt had the chance to go through the emotional hurt/loss the previous two have. But when May dies he‚Äôs ready to kill Osborne.

Tobey (who tried to kill the man who killed his Uncle Ben, and tried to save Norman in his first film) stops Holland from killing Norman. And Andrew stops him from suffering the death of the person he loves. And still after everything, Holland‚Äôs Peter still loses everyone he loved, but accepted his role as Spider-Man.

I know a lot of this is playing into my Spider-Man nostalgia but there‚Äôs some genuinely good writing that went into this and it‚Äôs made No Way Home my favorite MCU movie possibly ever.",ri7eum

Presumably Spider-Man doesn‚Äôt kill them immediately when they get back, then how big of an impact did that have on them? Does that make the Peters that came through the portals cease to exist or change their backstories completely? Remember that a large part of Spider-Man 3  (and 2 I guess) hinged on Peter‚Äôs regret about Norman‚Äôs death and Harry seeking revenge. I assume we‚Äôll never know since they won‚Äôt be continuing those series anymore but I still wonder",ri7eum

Seriously, my friends joke how much i avoid anyone discussing anything about a movie I want to see. If I see a piece of media about to start into it, I nope the fuck out.

That's what I said. 

Spider-Man still did all the same things. He still fought thanos. Everyone still knows Spider-Man as a hero in the MCU.

But no one knows who Spider-Man is under the mask, and no one knows who Peter is.

I'm not sure how that affects Spider-Man being in the MCU.",ri7eum

hxa2cwu,"Random response to your comment from 2 months ago, but I managed to see it tonight without knowing any of the spoilers (aside from the Doc Ock and GG reveal in the first trailer).

Didn‚Äôt get the first night crowd reaction though, but I was still grinning the entire time.",ri7eum

hovgbul,Agreed! But Andrew Garfield‚Äôs acting was great.,ri7eum
hp5qh7z,"I would absolutely do the same thing; there is such a innate human desire to share with others a moment of pure joy mixed with nostalgia.  It summons a feeling of childhood, like the feeling when you get a surprise present you really wanted, and we don‚Äôt get that feeling as adults very often sadly. You are lucky to be able to feel it over and over; that‚Äôs so fun! 

There‚Äôs a reason those ‚Äútheater reactions to Endgame‚Äù videos are so popular.",ri7eum

First when Doc Oct shows up on the freeway.

Third when Goblin takes over in Happy's place.

Fourth when the final battle starts.",ri7eum
hovk9uk,Trust your tingle!,ri7eum
how910d,I wasn‚Äôt even a hardcore Spiderman fan growing up. Toby‚Äôs Spiderman was simply the Spiderman my family and I grew up with. Sometimes nostalgia can be one hell of a drug. It really hit me in the feels to see him on the big screen.,ri7eum
hovxnqs,"The second one is a mess and half. 

But Garfield was great in both.",ri7eum
how0253,"I enjoyed them as well. I think part of why they're forgetful was because the MCU was already in full swing, having released the first Avengers movie the same year as TASM1. Plus the Tobey trilogy only ended 5 years earlier. Maybe even the conclusion of the Dark Knight trilogy the same year only served to introduce hero fatugue across different unconnected franchises. Just bad timing through and through and didn't have a lot of relevance for people to really care, despite Andy being a great Spiderman.",ri7eum
how8xcv,"They suck but Garfield absolutely kills it as Spider-Man. Also, the scene with Gwen is still arguably the saddest scene in marvel lol. He is the best Spider-Man for sure, Tobey the best Peter. Tom Holland is the weakest of them but still good.",ri7eum
hqi8pd5,Yes they are,ri7eum

hox30cj,"Youth pastors are generally more common in Protestant denominations, so usually not a priest. Some churches call the position youth minister, youth director, or youth worker. But yeah, basically a person who works specifically with teenagers. For example: I work with 6-12th graders. Some work with only middle grade students (typically 6-8) and some work with only high schoolers (9-12), but it just depends on how big the church is and how many people they have on staff.",ri7eum
hox75x2,"Awesome, thanks! I'll have to catch it on the rewatch",ri7eum
hp0ug8z,"It sounds weird, but I think Tom *visibly* aged in this movie.

At the beginning, he‚Äôs still believably a high schooler. By the end, something about his face just looks like a *man‚Äôs* face.",ri7eum
hoz33nc,"Holland grew on me, but that might prove his weakness. The actor's already 'old' - older than me, lol - and so presumably he's one of those guys who even at 30-40 will seem way younger, with the teenage voice and (acted) mannerisms (whereas look at Tobey's ageing, damn). Will be hard to pull off making him more mature but if they do it, I will be thoroughly impressed. No judgements this early on in the game, just keep giving me more MCU Spidey. I'm sold.",ri7eum
hp3e98y,Happy Cake Day! :),ri7eum
hoxhge2,"Im more confused about the financial implications of this spell. If all memories of peter parker are erased, does this mean he has no social security, no inheritance, no school records?",ri7eum
howi4wq,"Strange said early on that if his relationship with MJ happened because she knew he was Spider-Man, then it wouldn't stick. Since they only worked with Spider-Man because they knew Peter, now that they don't know Peter, that may cause them to forget working with Spider-Man.",ri7eum
hp6bzea,"Ned is the most confusing part of the spell. Essentially a whole chunk of his life is gone considering Peter has been such a huge part of it, even without Spiderman. I guess it can easily be explained with the Blip and how he lost chunks of memories along with 5 years.",ri7eum
hox2qdt,"Yeah, and does the spell extend to physical evidence? Like photos of Peter that MJ and Ned inevitably have? Does the US government forget Peter exists?? Probably not since he has an apartment and is getting his GED but argh so many questions",ri7eum
hoyxtxw,"Shh. Just let it be, and enjoy what we just got.",ri7eum
hpycywy,"When watching the movie i just thought to myself:"" That spell is really fucked up you could literally enslave humanity with it by controlling what they know and not know.",ri7eum
hoz4fdq,Strange magic goes brrrr. The problem with time-bending stuff is by the end of it you actually need a PhD or George RR Martin/Mark Z. Danielewski levels of planning to actually make it make sense.,ri7eum
hpd8mp1,"The way I see it the spell took the path of least resistance. Erasing physical records of Peter and rewriting events where necessary, but only just enough to fulfill the requirements of the spell. Because of this, there will be weird gaps like happy knowing May through spiderman or MJ being injured but not remembering why or how.

Since rewriting every event would be a pretty massive job for the spell, it again took the path of least resistance and just suppressed the memory of those events and threw a perception filter over them. Anytime a character thinks about it their brains will just gloss past inconsistencies. If they focused on these inconsistencies they might regain their memory but without an outside force (Peter) to press them on it, they will again just gloss over the details and rationalize it away.",ri7eum
hp5uzrh,"Regarding May knowing Spidey - in Far From Home we see that Spidey is appearing to help garner support for May‚Äôs charity, so Happy could remember May have a professional relationship with Spider-Man without knowing his identity.",ri7eum
hp0v54p,"Everyone I know who watched it just absolutely loved it and didn't like that I questioned it with the exact thoughts you wrote here. I would've rated the movie a 10/10 if not for this weird loop hole we have to accept that's going to be the foundation of all the next spiderman movies. Instead, I rate this an 8/10 because I just can't believe they'd end it this way so I'm trying not to think about it.",ri7eum
hox3aff,I think so but I wouldn't doubt marvel would change the rules to fit whatever story idea they have planned.,ri7eum
hp09bma,Possible ant man/wasp were in the quantum realm as well. If a snap cant get ant man there maybe a spell cant either.,ri7eum
howi6rh,"The spell didn't wipe away traces of his existence, it removed all memory of Peter Parker from people's minds. He still has a birth certificate, he still technically exists as a US citizen, it's just that literally nobody in the world knows who he is now.

Which kinda begs the question, does all the TV footage etc showing Peter as Spider-Man still exist? Wouldn't someone Google ""Spider-Man"" and see a bunch of old articles with Peter's face plastered across them? Best not to look too hard into the workings of comic book logic",ri7eum
hox8gw3,"Honestly, knowing these writers I feel like they would just let those inconsistencies still exist.

The pictures and videos are still out there. The graffiti is still on the walls. Anyone bothering to look into it could put the pieces together that something weird happened since nobody seems to remember the situation. Like a berenstain bears thing",ri7eum
howi8ce,"there's just no link between peter and spider-man for them, he does still exist as a person, you can't rent without money/bank/existing you know",ri7eum
hoz5eli,"That's a fair observation.

Some people noted that Tobey's Peter looks like he's worn down by life. Calm but with the burden of knowledge/experience.

Andrew's Peter seems depressed but strong still, curious still (ie his fascination with the science of the multiverse), full of wonder still and trying to be happy and proactive.",ri7eum
howmzy2,"Yeah if they wanted a clean break between Sony & the MCU they could have done so with only a few changes. When it was being explained at first I thought that was what they were doing, erasing Spider-Man from everyone‚Äôs memories. But they did the opposite instead, keeping him in the MCU but giving him a fresh start for a new trilogy instead.",ri7eum
hovr0a8,I mean Sony made this movie sooooo,ri7eum

howoj8m,"Don't you think them coming back would completely kill the growth Peter goes through by deciding to let them live their lives without him?

I think best to let the trilogy move on.",ri7eum

hpuzjj9,I think that's why the movies have a great opportunity. The comics have to go on forever but Tom Holland isn't going to stick around his entire life. They can give him his happy ending like Cap got when it comes time for the character to retire from the MCU. The movies can go through his arc and actually give it an ending instead of backpedaling like the comics have to. Miles is pretty popular now so they can introduce him later down the road to fill that gap when Peter retires/no longer needs his own movies too.,ri7eum
hozoc52,It‚Äôs about Peter choosing to do what‚Äôs best for everyone even if it isn‚Äôt the best for him. He would rather help people than be selfish. That‚Äôs what makes him such a popular character.,ri7eum

Sony already lost the public PR campaign of pulling the plug on Spiderman in the MCU. Now they don't have to. The only thing I'm really curious about is what they end up doing with Miles Morales or subsequent villains that have yet to appear in the MCU like Venom, Kraven the Hunter, Black Cat, etc.",ri7eum

As for Victor- that's the tricky part. A lot depends on the rise of Kang, the appearance of Namor (in Wakanda Forever), and the fallout of Multiverse of Madness.

It really depends on how they want to protray Kraven. He's getting his own movie apparently. With MCU blending their shows and movies, Kingpin can be what pins a lot of 'street level' heroes together (DD, Spiderman, Punisher, Moon Knight).

Do i think the design for the Goblin is better here? No. If it wasn't for the first movie existing, he'd have no reason to even be called Green Goblin. He doesn't even wear a mask. It was a bit crappy that they just threw a pair of goggles on him when he was on the glider, not very inventive.

He also implied that it was inevitable that his identity would get out when he was trying to talk Peter out of it, so I feel like this all means that the spell was more temporary than anything reality bending.

Yes.

> But now everybody forgets his secret identity is Peter Parker.

Correct.

> So the Avengers remember working with Spider-Man but not PP?

Also correct.

> Are they not going to work with him again?

I'm sure they will at some point. But no one would really have a way to get in touch with him directly. This one's a bit wonky obviously, but it'd be easy to just write it off as ""I guess Tony knew how to get in touch with him.""

>Is he no longer an Avenger?

Probably not, I guess. Although he was hardly really ""on the team"" anyway. He declined full membership in Homecoming. You could probably call him an Avenger in Infinity War (though I don't remember if that was really discussed), but then he was blipped. After his return in Endgame, the team hasn't exactly been together.

> But why does Peter Parker have to disappear entirely?

The idea is that space-time was cracking because the multiverse knew Peter Parker existed there. In order to right this, the safest move was to erase all evidence of Peter Parker. Therefore the multiverse wouldn't know he was there.

It's definitely not the most perfect logic, but it works imo.",ri7eum

If he's still present in the year book, then the spell was pointless. There would be so much evidence of him everywhere that it would create massive problems.

It's not just the yearbook. There would be photos and video of him on Academic Decathlon and records of all his grades, class projects, clubs, class trips, etc. He wouldn't need to get a GED at all, because he'd have all the proof right there. And that's just at school. He'd still be in the Avengers' records, and Happy would have plenty of documentation of who he was. Hell, Happy would certainly have recognized him from the photos May would've had around the apartment, let alone photos he would have taken himself.

Luke would *never* give up after seeing children he had basically raised get slaughtered by his own nephew' since I get his isolation, but it was still so... weird to go that route. I would have rather he became *slightly* bitter and save a handful of pupils and rebuild in hiding. That's what Luke would do character-wise. He wouldn't give up. I don't think it's literally antithetic to his character to give up like some do, but it just wasn't Star Wars. It's a space opera about good and evil, and this wasn't the right way to do 'grey' - KOTOR did that way better than moody Luke and Rey doing her thing (and I actually like Rey, she's not *that* bland a character. Heck, I even like Rose). Luke's arc is just sad and bitter. Making some snide comments at his nephew and refusing to save him when he previously saved an evil mass murderer robot (also related to him, in a saga about family and redemption) makes no sense, and killing himself to buy time was not as good a sacrifice as I once may have thought it was having just seen the film tbh.

La Dolce Vita - Mosaic masterpiece set in post way Italy. Movie really explorers the emptiness of material life and celebrity worship

Rosemary's Baby - NYC in the 60s, paranoia everywhere. Another movie that points it's lens at alienation, privacy, loss of control.

The Thing - Paranoia, isolation, suspicion. You never truly know who to trust.

The Godfather 2 - Appearances and perceptions over everything. The emptiness and self destructive nature power can bring.

howduwl,"> Why does May want to save random people

That's what May does

> who happened to come from another universe? 

Because she wants to help people, and because Norman knew who she was (but she didn't know him). Norman manipulater her based off of the May he knew very well from the Rami universe. 

>  Why does Peter want to do it? 

Because Peter is a hero, and he wants to redeem rather than send people to their deaths. 

This is why he doesn't also rip people's heads off with his bare hands, which he could do with ease. 

At this point, you're not questioning the movie, but the character. 

> Why is Sandman a villain?

From his perspective, he has just been yanked from his world and away from his daughter. He just doesn't care about this universe and will do whatever he can to get home. 

> Why is the Lizard a villain?

Lizard is taken from moments before his death, before he was redeemed. Doctor Octopus is redeemed in his final seconds in spider man 2 as well, yet we still get the evil version. 

> How the hell does people forgetting who Peter is close an inter dimensional portal?

Norman came to her for help and she believes Spider-Man should help him. I agree that it's very thin, but it's there.

Aunt May's words and to save them from dying.

>Why is Sandman a villain?

I'll give you this one. I guess he showed his true colors.

>Why is the Lizard a villain?

Because he is one?

>How the hell does people forgetting who Peter is close an inter dimensional portal?

The portals opened because it's bringing in people who know Peter Parker is Spider-Man. The solution to that is for everyone to forget who Peter is.",ri7eum

hpua1ug,"I liked Andrew's because it was understated and the whole scene afterwards was cute, but Tobey was fucking strange lmao - comes out in pure silence, dressed like a substitute teacher, Ned makes a joke about how uneventful it is, like wtf?",ri7eum
hpkbynb,100% this,ri7eum
hp52d27,Intelligence doesn't equal wisdom.,ri7eum
hoy356r,The plot demands that Peter and Strange stop using their brains.,ri7eum
howeiog,"Yea, academically is he is but he still hasn't learned how the world works or what it truly means to be a hero. I get where you're coming from but I think his mistakes are pretty believable for a 17 year old trying to just do the right thing.",ri7eum
hoxx4x5,We have just learned the difference between intelligence and wisdom.,ri7eum
hp1zh35,"Electro didn't want to go back to being a powerless nobody in his world, so there's that?

Don't get me wrong, I agree with pretty much everything you just said.",ri7eum
hp83xwa,"Kinda with you on this, but Guardians of the Galaxy 1 and Infinity War were the two good ones.",ri7eum
hp2p911,"Flash picked on him much more than either of the other cinematic Peters' Flashes did. In each of the previous two MCU Spider-Man movies. They were basically just a formality in those.

I agree that MCU Spidey didn't suffer enough in previous films to relate to the others. But he did in this film.

Aunt May trying to protect Peter, who is practically her son, isn't unbelievable, come on. To me Peter's failure and misery wasn't forced but rather long overdue.",ri7eum
hp334fi,penis parker,ri7eum
hp2bgmr,Ok,ri7eum
howrm3s,Seem like unnecessary filler. Movie is already long as it is,ri7eum
hp03d4d,Damn I must be getting old. Appreciate it.,ri7eum
hpld53g,"Sandman could've been good if Raimi had his way but he was forced to shoehorn in Topher Venom and that likely impacted how Sandman was supposed to develop. Thomas Haden Church is also really wooden in the role so overall he just comes across as an entitled snot who thinks consequences don't apply to him just because he has a sick daughter. I mean, other than the fact that he killed a man (even accidentally), he kept resorting to and seeking out violence for no damn reason. You'd think after getting your ass handed to you and almost dying by Bully Maguire that you would just get the fuck out but no, he went and decided to hunt him only to encounter Topher. Same in NWH, he just switches from ""I'm here to help"" to ""I wanna kick your ass"" in a snap of a finger.

As for the other points, I agree there are certainly things that were done the way I would've done differently but the movie is still entertaining as hell. This is why a lot of people were frustrated on behalf of Eternals. Spider-Man gets a pass for clunky writing but Eternals is shit on for not reaching Oscar level perfection.",ri7eum
hoxxshz,"Sure, but I never saw anything that definitively said they were in it, or for how long. Which I was so happy for",ri7eum
hoxgsms,Maybe,ri7eum
hoyxz6v,"Yeah, I got nothing on that. Unless it‚Äôs some master plan to have the symbiote seek out Spider-Man, drawn in by his pain of losing everything, and sort of follow the 90s animated version where the suit augmented all of his anger. But, that‚Äôs just a swinging wild guess.",ri7eum
hoygdl4,"Paraphrasing here but basically Venom tells Eddie the symbiotes are a hive mind that spans multiverses right before the scene happens.

So essentially, as long as ANY symbiote knows that ANY Peter Parker in the multiverse is Spider-Man that checks the box.

It's a cop out for sure, but it's in there.",ri7eum
hozj13r,Eh idk if they bring in venom or someone else might be a bit before we see that happen,ri7eum
hp3fgxo,"They all forgot Peter, not Spider-Man 

So in Happy‚Äôs new memory, he knows that there‚Äôs a superhero named Spider-Man, who helped Aunt May at the homeless shelter and helped Tony fight Thanos, but he doesn‚Äôt know that Spider-Man was Aunt Mays nephew under the hood",ri7eum
hp3guqj,He remembers Spider-Man not Peter.,ri7eum
hp3t45e,I think it was just a reference for comic fans that are in the know.,ri7eum
hp51g33,The Aunt May line to Doc Ock about the type of water he drinks had to be written for little kids because what the hell? He's not a real octopus lady.,ri7eum
hp50oca,">Does this means that when Tobey's Peter goes back (the one that was present in this movie) the spider man 1-3 still happened. But when Norman goes back he continues on another timeline with another peter that we haven't seen.

Yup. Its pretty similar to Endgame where Hulk tries to explain time travel. The Loki series expands on it more if you have seen it.",ri7eum
hp85csg,He didn‚Äôt change it. The events still happened. People just don‚Äôt remember who Peter Parker is because of a spell.,ri7eum
hpeurro,"I think we got to see the next Thanos level threat at the end of Loki.    At least I assumed Kang the Conqueror would be it.      

In Feige We Trust.",ri7eum
hplzw2z,"I don't think a movie riddled with obvious plot holes and contrived scenarios with none of the returning Raimi/Webb characters feeling like their old self and some shitty CGI and fight scenes constitutes a good movie, personally.",ri7eum
hqx7dbk,"MJ throwing in all that random SJW shit surrounding homecoming or the Washington memorial or the patriarchy, yadda yadda. She was incredibly insufferable there. Then there was all of the bad casting chocies. MJ has a specific look and they went with a black girl that doesn't look or act like her. Flash Thompson acts a specific way too and they just changed that completely. Same goes for Peter's best friend as Ned instead of Harry Osborne.

All of these things by themselves would be merely annoying if they actually served a purpose instead of simply being change for the sake of change, but they serve no purpose. They didn't change thigns around to tell a better story or anything, the characters sucked and contribute dnothing meaningful with the changes. So if it's going to suck anyway, they could at least make it close to the comics so they get points for accuracy.",ri7eum
hrcbyky,It‚Äôs a negotiation tactic. Publicly say you are happy if you don‚Äôt play the character again in an effort to get the studio to give you the big bucks for a new contract.,ri7eum
hr8zyjq,"I think he's locked in for more Spiderman as part of some Sony contract but I also don't care enough to look into it, so yahknow. Maybe I'm wrong.",ri7eum
hr7mji1,"Well, they killed Gwen after Stan had left the editor's job and moved to California. He only found out about it later. That's why he said bring her back. Then they literally cloned her, and had her move to Europe, lol.

Well, dude, this is magic. They made it this way so they could reset MCU Spidey back to a more comic-book accurate version. Make up whatever you want. But, it IS more fair to have Peter not get to do the original spell after screwing it up. It's just odd that Peter had to give Strange the idea. Strange knows about magic, so it should've been his suggestion, explaining to Peter the only way to fix the spell is to go further into erasing memories.",ri7eum
hoxuz4n,"It did a similar thing I felt Eternals did, where Chloe and Jon got to slip in a couple creative shots (the facetime scene, swinging inbetween the power lines) that Marvel allows to happen for approximately 2 seconds before going back to the pre-approved shots. Like when MJ and Peter finally kissed at the end, and the shot was hanging on them staring into each other‚Äôs eyes, they could‚Äôve just let the cameras roll and show a passionate kiss the whole way through. But no, it has to cut like 3 times to show their faces as they‚Äôre going in for no reason",ri7eum
hozb05i,FFH was because of stark related stuff yknow,ri7eum
hplek9z,"Key word, ‚Äúif true.‚Äù There‚Äôs nothing yet to actually confirm that, and I‚Äôd be willing to bet they don‚Äôt explain it tbh",ri7eum
hqf2wxt,If thats true that the symbiote itself knows Peter is Spiderman then why doesnt it get transported back to its other dimension with Eddie? Lot of contrived laziness in this movie,ri7eum
howj7um,"Nah I think they‚Äôll introduce another Eddie. I think one of the main points of NWH was to set up Peter to be all alone and essentially soft reboot his life with all new people. This will probably be the last time we see people from his high school life like MJ, Ned, and Flash.",ri7eum
hpq790n,"Yea, see the main issue is you‚Äôre trying to apply logic to a magic spell. 

Like that‚Äôs where your suspension of disbelief ends. Not the fact that it‚Äôs a movie with a wizard and a kid with spider powers.",ri7eum
hqco2dz,"Don‚Äôt listen to this other guy. This film was so devoid of logic it hurts. Enjoyable? Sure. But extremely poorly written. The whole premise of the movie is ridiculous. Spideys friends don‚Äôt get into MIT, so dr strange performs a very dangerous magic spell (made worse by the fact we know all the terrible shit they went through) to make everyone forgot about him. And then because they communicate like 10 year olds the spell goes bad.  

The premise is just un-defendable. Throw in other random ridiculous plot lines and it‚Äôs a total mess",ri7eum
hpq8s3s,"> Ned should NOT be able to use magic. That‚Äôs dumb as hell and smells like the writers not knowing a better way to introduce the Spidermen.

It was forshadowed that Ned could do magic before he actually started doing magic.",ri7eum
hp7uirn,So more realistic then current Spiderman tech lol,ri7eum
hr9jlqs,"Gotta remember, Ock killed himself to break his machine. That would still happen. Norman also killed himself by pushing his wrist buttons. If he already pushed the buttons before he was zapped, he'd still get killed. I don't recall how Electro died, lol.",ri7eum
hsret82,"Thats a good point and that should have been the plot. 
But Cumberbach did not go back in time to get them. 

The evidence is that In the movie dr octopus remembered the moments just before he was drowned with the reactor. How can that Dr. octopus experience something that didn't happen to him if he was taken from a a time space occuring before that incident.",ri7eum
hovk0cf,"And to top that off, they were standing on the huge Captain America shield that had fallen off of the Statue of Liberty",ri7eum
hovkd9o,"Venom knew because of the hive mind collective of all the symbiotes across dimensions which he referenced right before they get teleported to the MCU. He doesn‚Äôt see Peter on tv until after they‚Äôve been teleported. 

That‚Äôs why he got teleported, knowing who Peter was.",ri7eum
hpk1hrr,"Not saying I don't believe you, but man my stars was almost as dumb as the marvel crowd.",ri7eum
hpa0z18,I whisper but carry on,ri7eum
hp9q487,"Huh. I dont remember a time when people expressed love for Rise of the Skywalker.

Personally I don't get your take. I found NWH awesome for many reasons. It turned the MCU Spider Trilogy in a stealth origin story for a more classic Spider-man. From youthful optimistic to a down of his luck hero still trying to do good. NWH enriched The Amazing Spider-man films and actually made them worth watching/revisiting because they had such great payoffs here. (I say that as a person that used to hate TASM2). And it payed homage to the original Spiderman trilogy by revisiting its character and even giving a better outing for the Green Goblin than the original since they rid of the mask that hid Dafoe's face.

The main problem with the sequel Star Wars Trilogy and even the prequel star Wars trilogy is that they diluted the love of the original trilogy by just telling meandering stories while not really adding anything that made rewatching the original trilogy more enjoyable instead of less. This isn't Anakin making C3P0 for no other reason than to wink at the audience. Or Luke going crazy after a bad dream and trying to kill his nephew after how hard he worked to save his father.  The same problems happened with The Hobbit Trilogy and every Terminator or Alien movie after part 2.  That wasn't the case here. This wasn't showing me John Conner or Newt just to kill them at the start of the next movie. Making me feel like I waste the time and attention I invested in those characters. No this is revisiting those character and watching how they've grown, giving them some redemption, or at least a second chance at normalcy. Some characters the chance to stop a version of themselves from making the same mistakes they did, or relive the same tragedies. Or the actors another shot with with characters that weren't well recieved. 

So. I really don't get your stance. But oh well. More power to you. I'm personally in awe of the movie. For me it told a story that speaks to the heart of being Spider-man. A character that's been my favorite superhero for decades. With great Power there must also come Great responsibility. Not just when things are easy. Not just when nothing goes wrong.  I think it's an amazing love letter to everything that came before it. And the culmination of 20 years worth of Spider-man movies. It's not perfect, but most of the flaws I see in it are overwhelmed by the successes.",ri7eum
hpuqv6w,To me it was most upsetting to be seeing better Spider Man actors that we did have and could have but instead we are stuck with Tom Holland at the moment.,ri7eum

hp4fg1b,[deleted],ri7eum
hp7eobi,"Per a story in Friday's NYT, Feige said there will not be the same ""separation trauma"" that occurred between ***Far From Home*** and ***No Way Home.***

Yet that only ensures Spider-Man's future in the MCU is being hammered out, that perhaps Tom Holland's Peter Parker is being retired in order to introduce Miles Morales into Phase 4. I would say with the passing of Chadwick Boseman and the decision not to give Sam the super soldier serum to be Capt. America, the pressure is back on Marvel to have more POC superheroes (although Matt Murdock showing up along with another Netflix Marvel character on this week's *Hawkey* strong suggests that Luke Cage could be coming back as well).",ri7eum

She seems to have one mode and that's a angsty with a side of wit. The amount of angst and amount of wit varies depending on the role or what she is doing. But her being seems to remain constant.

Sure, it‚Äôs an American reaction, but dancing in some Indian theaters is an Indian reaction. Both I think are cool in their own ways.

That whole Lego Death Star set (encompassing the Emporer figure as well) had quite a sentimental value to both Peter and Ned as it was something they were building together in Homecoming.

All he would remember is that he worked with Spiderman.

The people who forgot him can piece together that they forgot something and can investigate what it was and who they forgot. But that's not the point of the spell, it's that right now, they don't remember, they all have gaps in their memories.

I thought it really felt like the Infinity Gauntlet story from the comics, or any other big crossover, where the heroes have to come together and combine their talents to defeat an epic-scale villain.

He knows he loves Wanda and that they‚Äôve been together, but his mind won‚Äôt go down the track it needs to in order for him to realize he has no idea how they even met. So I‚Äôd assume that if someone forced Happy to think about it, he‚Äôd realize he doesn‚Äôt actually remember who Spider-Man is without the suit.

Edit: Granted, it‚Äôs not quite the same for Vision since Wanda created that version of him, so there are no actual memories being squashed. But the experience would be the same I think?",ri7eum

Some super in a mask that helps them out every now and them. Happy would have to have to learn any specific detail about him fresh. 

So it's closer to if Clark Kent *never* existed and there was only ever Superman: A distant figure that only seems to interact people when he came to save the day. You put a guy like that in a mask, and he just becomes an enigma. No one ever talks about a Clark Kent because no one remembers him growing up in Smallville. Or working at the Daily Planet. Or ever read a by line from him in the newspaper. They never wonder why Clark Kent isn't there when Superman is there because Clark never existed for them to notice in the first place.

The spell was pulling people who knew Spider-Man was Peter Parker. So them being pulled along with the villains makes sense.

They don't roll back time, so MJ and Ned were already rejected from MIT, and didn't forget Spiderman so should remember all the stuff they did with Spiderman (so he should just be able to show them that he's Spiderman), etc. And if they all somehow forgot who Spiderman is (which clearly no one did because he's all over the news as usual), then there should be huge holes in people's memories that can't be filled that make a ton of people look for answers. At the very least Shield should be like ""how have we had this Spiderdude working for us but a bunch of our records just don't say anything about who he is even though he's right there in NY?""

I expected that this movie would have to do a lot of heavy lifting after the last one with all of its nonsense, and I feel like it largely succeeded. The end solution was terrible. They could have had a Strange from another universe who still had the time stone pop in, grab the box from the explosion point and return them all to their respective universes.

Kinda how Happy still knows Aunt May and goes to her gravesite even though he only knows her because of Peter. Without Peter there would be no connection at all between them.

Finally, we've seen how strong Peter gets when paired with the Venom symbiote, and I believe it's canonically established that *that* strength displayed is around what Spidey is actually at *if* he *didn't* pull his punches *as a teenage supe.*

So, while he may not eclipse Thor (as I was mistaken) in most matters, Spidey is definitely crazy crazy strong.

* Talk to your friends. Throughout the movie he blindsides and overrides his allies and friends because he thinks he knows better. By the end he should know to trust them and their input. NAH, executive decision, I think it's best you all keep the memories lost.  
* Broken promises. Peter almost became the bad guy, thereby breaking, like, a dozen promises, but was saved and managed not to. NAH, forget the promise at the end about reminding people, fuck that, Spidey boy knows better.  
* You can't be Spiderman alone. The entire movie was about him trying to deal with the issues of being Spiderman, failing, and getting bailed out by friends. He very nearly cracked, but literally was saved by more than one Spiderman, because a single lone Spiderman is not enough. NAH Spidey Big strong man, don't need anything like friends or family. Just a shitty apartment and literal nonexistence. How's he gonna get a job and money, anyway, if he doesn't exist?  
* 'Fixing' people. Remember how the villains were good guys plagued with mental problems that he tried to fix, and return them to their semblance of normal? I would say magical mind wipes count. NAH, even though his friends explicitly said they want to be reminded, let's just ***not***.",ri7eum

I don‚Äôt mind the spell at the beginning, the movie is explaining it‚Äôs rules and premise, and I accept it. The problem with the ending, for me, is that it creates new rules out of nowhere, and even within this new rules it‚Äôs a bit without logic.",ri7eum

I‚Äôd absolutely hate to lose him from the MCU as well, but if history has taught us anything, it‚Äôs that Sony will milk the character and franchise as much as it possibly can. So I at least feel should things ever come to that point, then at least Tom, the actors, crew, and other people who‚Äôve worked so hard on these films (dating back to Tobey and Andrew) won‚Äôt have to feel as if it‚Äôs all been for nothing and the character/story just gets retconned again without anything to show for it. 

That being said, I‚Äôm really hoping Marvel and Sony have smoothed things over so we‚Äôll continue to have Spider-Man as an active part of the MCU. At least that‚Äôs what the ending felt like to me. Yes, it does allow for things to still make sense should the worse happen. However, it seemed to lean more towards Spider-Man-centric content in his upcoming films while still maintaining his presence as an Avenger despite nobody remembering Peter Parker. Plus that could throw a fun spin on those future interactions with the other members in an interesting way. Regardless, I‚Äôll be keeping my fingers crossed that it all works out!",ri7eum

However I had to suspend by disbelief about how every place he applied for turned him down. Surely one high profile university would have actively tried to recruit him, because he's Spiderman. Let alone all of them rejecting him.

He's clearly heavily associated with Stark tech and companies and governments are frothing at the mouth to get then in past movies, so he should have had some head hunting from that. Surely Stark Tech would have taken him in just to prevent any potential losses.

But this is more of a comment about the Shield and Stark family not better looking after him. They gave him Iron man world protection influstrucure but nothing else, surely he would be inducted into the company or shield itself.",ri7eum

MIT has the least legacy and bought admissions of some of the top tiers. Compare it's reputation to Harvard for example. Considering that MIT makes every student pass its 6 General Intitute Requirements (including mulitvariable calculus, genetic biology, electricity and magnetism etc). People who can't pull their own weight flunk out fast. With a 96% 6 year grauduation rate and many reasons that could count for the 4%, obviously this isn't many people. 

Not saying that buy in doesn't happen, but rich kids are aren't a super large percentage there and there are probably even number of students from lower social economic backgrounds. 

That said, this is the MCU and Tony Stark had way too much sway over everything. So it feasible that he could've gotten Peter through the door if he was alive and his word would be trusted. Nonetheless, it does seem like Peter didn't really try to leverage his connections in the movie.",ri7eum

hp14xr2,"Who did they hurt prior to Peter helping them? Remember, he's never seen any of them before. 

Green Goblin was a sick old man who was scared of his own mental illness and was actively seeking help. Hadn't hurt anyone. 

Electro was a little crazy and clearly power hungry, but the only person he hurt prior to being locked in a cell was...Peter. And once he reformed into a human body, he was semi-reasonable. He was far more willing to talk then to do anything.

Sandman literally showed up to help. He was a little standoffish, but he never hurt anyone.

Peter only saw Lizard in a cage, and Dr. Connors was pretty reasonable.

Prior to GG flipping out, Peter saw some pretty weird people, but except for Doc Oct, no one was really hurting other people, and Doc Oct was a.) neutralized, and b.) being controlled by his tentacles.

Tom Holland's Peter didn't see villains with bloody track records. He saw powered people who were having problems.

The MCU Peter is still very young and really has been given everything he has like his suit and had been made a member of the Avengers very young in his life. He hasn't really had to work for anything and who knows if he even had an Uncle Ben ?

Obviously we don't know what's next but I hope it leads to a lot of character development for Peter. We do see it at the end with him making his own suit.

Andrew's Peter says that he got bitter after Gwen died and sort of lost himself.  Also said there wasn't enough time to be ""Peter"" or something like that, which would been he was fully focusing/dedicating his time to being Spidey.  This is the in-universe reason for him showing up in the suit.

Tobey's Peter still had his MJ, was older/had a bad back, and even said that that Venom (well, alluding to the name), was the craziest villain he fought.  So, he likely had more reason to just be regular Peter most of the time, and his universe likely didn't have lots of ongoing villains after the conclusion of Spider-Man 3.  This is the in-universe reason why he showed up in civilian clothes.",ri7eum

But this movie has proven to everyone, when you bring all three Spiderman together, the most popular one to stand out is Tobey Maguire. Im not saying he is the best. Personally i think Andrew Garfield Spiderman is the best, but in terms of popular wise, 100% Tobey Maguire takes the crown. I mean he has fans  ranging from the age of late 30s to kids in pre-school. I've watched the movie only once(i live in Malaysia) and boy oh boy everyone was screaming TOBEYYYY (including me lol). Alot of us in our late 30s & 20s hold Tobey as the GOAT simply bcoz of  nostalgia, hence him being the most popular. N i dunno man you can debate abt the 'bigger cheer' but from Twitter and other Reddit subs, everyone keeps talking abt ppl going berzerk over Tobey's appearance. Even a couple of friends of mine in the UK said the same. Whatever it is, love to all three Spiderman ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüï∑Ô∏èüï∑Ô∏èüï∑Ô∏è",ri7eum

hpjydyt,"I get that, and most certainly agree that there's an aspect of it that's maybe a bit unfair for MJ and Ned, but I also think it's an impossibly complicated and difficult situation to be in, and telling someone outright ""Hey, you don't remember me but your memory was wiped and we used to be best friends/boyfriend and girlfriend"" more than likely is going to do more harm than good. It's probably the one scene in the entire movie that truly demonstrates how much Peter has actually grown and matured, because he's actually taking a step back and having some perspective on the situation. The way I interpreted it wasn't that Peter was going to cut them out of his life for good, but moreso that he realized in that moment that his friends are doing ok and he actually did the mature thing for once and decided not to jump head first into a quick fix to a problem (like he'd done with the spell at the beginning of the movie). I took it to mean that this isn't a problem he can just fix instantly with a speech he wrote down, because why would that actually work? The mature, sensible thing is to try and rebuild what you'd lost, which is going to take a lot more time and effort than it would take to read from a piece of paper. And Peter might have to consider if he's ready or willing to let people into his life again, let alone people who will choose to allow themselves to get hurt by being with him. And it's not like this is a hypothetical that doesn't have any precedent. It's already happened to his friends and family, so it's a very real and likely possibility. We the audience know and recognize that he and his friends are a good team and should all be together, but Peter is obviously still wrestling with the dilemma. It's frustrating to watch, for sure, but in the context of the movie and his character, it makes perfect sense for him to do what he does at the end. And if characters only ever made the exact right decisions all the time and everything always worked out perfectly as they should by the end, then there would be no drama or conflict to the story, and the characters wouldn't be relatable or human. 

And I just don't know that I see this specific example as being ""sexist"" in the way you'd framed it. That's not to say other movie examples don't follow the cliche in a way that actually is sexist. I just don't think the take away in this case was that Peter, the man, is making the decision because he thinks he knows better than MJ, the woman. And I say that because MJ wasn't the only part of the equation (he also made the same promise to Ned), and her being a woman doesn't really have any bearing on the decision not to tell her what happened. The movie demonstrated time and again just how much Peter trusted MJ and Ned to help him and treated them as his equals. And if the roles were reversed, or if both characters were the same sex, the dilemma and motivations behind the decision wouldn't hit any differently.",ri7eum
hoxel4r,Yeah! I think(or hope at least) this sets up a whole college trilogy that features Peter's life more akin to how it was in the 90s animated series because that'd be perfect.,ri7eum

hovoql3,"Fully agree. TASM2, as bad of a movie as it is, will always be the greatest live action depiction of the character to me because they finally got the suit right and they finally got the affable yet snarky humor of the character right.",ri7eum
howgyr7,"I think he‚Äôs definitely the best actor of the three overall, but even with the criticism those movies faced, hardly any of it was directed at Andrew. I didn‚Äôt expect it, but he was my favourite spidey in NWH, and man I hope we get to see him again",ri7eum

This is not only a hot take, but the truest statement since water is wet. Andrew Garfield will always be my spiderman, I'm so glad he got to tie it off with not only a lot of fun, but some superb acting.",ri7eum
hoxvsjy,"Do you mean the Timothy Dalton?

Pierce Brosnan will always be considered one of the great Bonds for *GoldenEye* alone.

Dalton is the Bond that was perfect for the role but never got a great movie.  They even both only had two movies of similar relative quality (*Living Daylights* was *okay* and *License to Kill* was pretty bad).",ri7eum

Seeing Maguire and Garfield again just makes you remember their take on the character and that they both brought something different to the role.",ri7eum
howi6wb,"Oh for sure replace Tom with Andrew and he do just as good job if not better as Spiderman, just didnt get that same treatment when he had the role. I think hes a amazing actor I love him in most movies hes done like Social Network where he has a few amazing moments with Jesse Eisenberg",ri7eum
hovz0m3,I was on the Garfield sucks side till this even with better writing I felt he just missed the core of Peter. Now I'm 100% on your side that he was just done dirty by the writing. Sure he's a pretty boy and not as depressy as Peter normally is but damn his version in this had what matters most Peters's heart and soul that undescribable trait. Also has the dude aged like at all? Like damn he still looks young af.,ri7eum

hp16og7,"After watching this movie I really want Sony to try ASM3 again. Hopefully by now they'll have learned enough not to fuck it up. Maybe Feige would be willing to give them crustructive criticism on the ASM3 script. He did for ASM2 but they chose to ignore him. I feel like even Andrew would be wise enough to put his foot down if the script was garbage. Marvel also made it clear with Venom returning to his universe that the Sony Spider-Man Cinematic Universe is not part of the MCU. They could retcon Venom as being part of the ASM universe and re-edit/shoot Morbius to fit in it as well. Also I wouldn't be against Tobey's Spider-Man 4 happening, maybe give it a nicer ending to the franchise. I think that would be farther reach than ASM3 though.",ri7eum
hoxaegy,"I completely agree with this, and glad Marvel Studios gave him the opportunity to show off how great he is in the role.",ri7eum
hoxivmq,"I just rewatched TASM1/2 this week, and it wasn't just Sony that made those movies bad. Every dialog scene between Garfield and Emma Stone was incredibly bad. Apparently they just improved most of them. So the written parts were bad, and the unwritten parts were also bad.

I think he had the *potential* to be a really good Spider-Man, but he just came off as an asshole rather than snarky.
He was absolutely amazing in NWH and good writing meant that his good acting could be the best Spider-Man he could be, but lets not look at TASM with rose colored glasses.",ri7eum
hovzj3f,Totally agree,ri7eum
hpnh3oz,It was so good seeing him get this second chance,ri7eum
hpnz0sy,I mean...if you're two movies in and they're both shit....it's kinda time to call it. He's a good actor and he might have been able to be a good Spider-Man/Peter Parker if the writing were stronger  and the characterization better but....it wasn't.,ri7eum

And with the multiverse and the absolutely crazy good reception he‚Äôs gotten, they can justify it with the amount of love and money they are gonna get.

PS: Andrew was my least liked walking into the film and leaving, I need to see AMS3 with a competent director over it. It may end up a classic.",ri7eum

hpc6thc,"She's MJ Watson, and I think this is the first movie to explicitly state her last name as Watson and Neds and Leeds.

I think in the first movie they kept it open in case of audiences hated her, but by the second movie, they decided to make her the MCU MJ.",ri7eum
hoxev95,"maybe because her death basically proves what Strange said was right, it's not Peter's problem, and by helping them, it lead to May's death.

Compared to how Uncle Ben died in the first movie, it's by Peter NOT bothering to do anything. So ""with great power comes great responsibility"" line in No Way Home does not feel impactful enough",ri7eum

And then May's death followed by the nostalgia of the two other spideys showing up, Garfield's Spiderman's insecurities, but Garfield's insecurities as being the least liked/appreciated Spiderman could definitely be felt and I find it amazing they dealt with that, all 3 spideys lifting each other up, Garfield catching MJ, Holland almost killing Osbourne, Holland dealing with having to be forgotten, and finally Holland starting a fresh rebooted life of being alone.  That was a ton of emotion packed into an hour. Looking forward to seeing it again.",ri7eum
hp8harg,TVA hoovered them right up for pruning immediately after they arrived home.,ri7eum
hp1oupd,"Thing is, usually I find it annoying when accents break because those moments pull me out of the movie. But he was so damn excited and charming as Peter 3 that I didn't care. I loved to see him back in the Spidey suit. (Him on cobweb duty was adorable. Because of course Peter would not be insulted and would do that. He's Aunt May's kid. You know she had him on cobweb duty back home the moment she found out about his secret identity.)

Strange enough, when Holland was around American actors his accent never broke. Not once. But when he was around the British ones, it broke a couple of times. But only like twice. It's neat to realize that Holland needs to be around American actors at all times in order to maintain his accent. The moment he is around a fellow Brits, it's harder for him to maintain his accent. I wonder if he maintains an American accent if he is around Americans between takes to help himself out. But put him around a Brit, he will slip back into his natural accent between takes out of familiarity.",ri7eum

That said, Sandman felt weird to me. He was a good guy for most of the film. I still don't really understand why he seemed to go bad at the end. Even if he was intending to just get the box to activate it, fighting the Spider-men (lol) just made it more likely another villain would destroy the box.",ri7eum
hpanyb2,"He has his complete intelligence as a Scientist as the Lizard at that point though. The Amazing Spider-Man just dropped the ball and gave him a really stupid villain plan. That shit can work in comics and cartoons, bit it is just dumb in a live action movie.",ri7eum

Molina and Dafoe both got a couple moments where they just got to react with their face and think for a few moments, the entire scene with the three Spideys just chatting about what their lives are like was glorious, and so much else!

I'm going to go see it again tomorrow.",ri7eum
hoxxhn7,This movie really showed just how stupidly over-powered the Spidey-Sense is and I loved it. Goblin hadn't even *done* anything yet and Peter knew something was up.,ri7eum

You have a bunch of mad scientist geniuses with superpowers trying to cause mayhem imprisoned and you‚Äôre going to repeatedly give them the details of everything they need to know to get the upper hand?

I also was disappointed at how foolish and easily outsmarted they made Dr. Strange. Also the Strange we know would not have agreed to involve 2 H.S. kids in order to clean up his own spell. A doctor‚Äôs first edict is Do No Harm. Involving kids with dangerous super villains is totally out of character.

And they really had to step on the gas with them to make up for the loss of the others.

But now he's had his own trilogy and played Spidey in more movies than anyone. He's established himself and can do the old favourite tropes again.

hpip80n,"Damnit, i was literally picturing Jean Ralphio as Andrew Garfield and it all made total sense to me until your reply lol. I was never really that familiar with Andrew Garfield until his spiderman films. Same with Chris Pratt, i completely forgot about chris pratt from Parks when the first Gaurdians came out. I need to rewatch Jean Ralphios scenes in parks because i now cant stop picturing Andrew Garfield as Jean Ralphio. Anyways i see exactly what you mean though, they both also have that same goofy looking face. I really wish someone didnt downvote me for my last comment. The downvote made me feel even dumber lol.",ri7eum

howomcw,I disagree I find his superman super-uncharismatic meanwhile Garfield exsudes charisma.,ri7eum
howwyi4,"I agree! But I felt most of the emotion was packed into one moment (the snap). 

This has emotional beats all throughout it.",ri7eum
hoxdil2,I doubt the MCU flash has what it takes. Like military and even being a war hero loosing legs and all that emotion. I can't see that from this Flash,ri7eum
how8d6k,"Agent Venom in the MCU could be cool, but I don't see it working with this incarnation of Flash. In NWH specifically, I really hate how they sorta just glossed over his initial reaction and then after that he was mostly used as comedic relief. There was just so much more they could've done with Spider-man's biggest fan finding out that his idol is the same person he bullies at school. How would he react? Would he feel remorseful and apologize to peter? 

Even within the existing movie, there were a lot of missed opportunities. When Peter's going back to school, he could've stood up to the mob instead of just plugging his book. When he found out Peter/MJ/Ned didn't get into MIT, he could've offered to talk to the admissions officer to try and get the school to reconsider. It's just sad that they were so close to doing some really interesting things with the character, but instead chose not to",ri7eum
hpio9rj,"Yeah and i love that he still wants to turn people into lizards lol. I thought his plan in ASM1 was kinda stupid but it was redeemed in NWH in that its actually sorta hilarious what his plan was and kinda makes sense given that once he becomes lizard, of course his original humanitarian ideas for regrowing limbs were gonna get twisted and morph into a plan to turn the human race into Lizards. Hes Lizard and Lizards gonna Lizard. It kinda makes me wosh we had a scene of him going into a villainess monologue about human evolution requiring humans to evolve into Lizards. I swear this film made every past villain better, even the good ones like doc and Goblin. Proves Execution is everything.",ri7eum
hp0pkb0,"It was a plot device used badly for stupid reasons in the comics, but at least here it seems it‚Äôs being used for the right reasons. Restarting Spider-Man as a young broke guy with no millionaire/Avengers connections and no ridiculous amounts of tech can refocus the whole series into what it should have been from the beginning.",ri7eum
hp35rc4,They even got the pointing meme in there!!,ri7eum
hp2cz56,"Yeah i think this was one of the more interesting sources of this movie. For 4 of the 5 villains, part of the cure is to de-power them. Electro, Sandman, and Lizard, all clearly end the movie as more or less normal humans, and Green Goblin looks that way as well. But Otto kept all of his abilities, he just wasn't being driven mad anymore. *And* it looked like he kept the arc reactor. That could definitely keep to some interesting things.",ri7eum
hp9svic,I thought that was a wonderful little character moment for Octavius. Having him hold the Stark arc reactor in his hand and marvel at something that he spent his whole life working for in his universe and seeing it fully realized before him was beautiful.,ri7eum

howoo3y,"‚ÄúFresh start, huh‚Äù",ri7eum
howl0pe,"It puts an interesting twist on the film as well of Peter really coming into his own. 

When the film began he was still tied to May, who was tied to Happy who was tied to Stark. Not only was she his parent and carer, she became his link to the wider superhero community.

Once she died, he realised he also couldn't rely on that any more and needed to go on his own which means no school friends, no girlfriend. Tom left this movie is basically the same place as we left Tobey in Spider-Man 1",ri7eum
hozm84v,"I'm so confused by how people remember interactions with Peter. Cuz the events clearly still happened (MJ got hurt, Happy dated May, etc.). Did Happy just accompany Tony to a random woman's apartment and then start stalking her for no reason? I know he said he met her through Spider-Man, but that makes no sense with all the stuff Happy would've done if Spider-Man wasn't Peter. Did MJ and Ned still go to Ellis Island to help Spider-Man?",ri7eum
hqi3kl3,"It not hurting doesn‚Äôt mean happy though. In hoping we get some resolution from a second trilogy. It‚Äôs worth hurting for your friends and family! 

Home trilogy‚Äôs got a lot of heart.",ri7eum
hq2ilbx,"That line really wrapped up the whole movie, and who Peter was going to have to be as a character now for me. SOOO well done, and such a simple, but powerful line. Sad I haven't seen more people mention it, but man, if that wasn't the most impactful line for me.",ri7eum
hp1e0gd,"They aren‚Äôt ‚Äúthem‚Äù anymore though, the people who wanted that were the people who actually knew him. This version of those two don‚Äôt know him. It was a sentimental request but it wasn‚Äôt really a logical or fair one, and I think Peter realized that in the end. It would never be like it was, years of history and bonding, the glue that makes a relationship stick, was undone.",ri7eum
hp4u4r6,"Yeah, and MJ made it clear she didn't want to forget.

But admittedly, it's a big grey area since once they do forget, they have no idea they're missing out of anything. And while it might be somewhat their choice, it also does affect Peter because he has to worry about his friends getting hurt simply due to being associated with him.",ri7eum
how81ol,Oh I agree that seems to be the direction their going. Just saying it isn't a lesson so much as a very bas coping mechanism that will bite him the ass.,ri7eum
howq0js,"This is something that becomes apparent looking at the very first moments of the movie. MJ immediately gets physically harassed by a crowed, scared shitless by being flung through New York, and is almost hit by a train. Peter even leaves her balancing on a beam on top of a bridge without even thinking she could fall off. This movie really brought him down to earth in that regard, especially with May‚Äôs death.",ri7eum
how061f,I think that last part is very fair and a good reading.,ri7eum

hrc2lrz,"No, but we like the theme to be consistent and for characters to learn and grow.

Considering that they have specifically had a moment where MJ asks Spidey to talk to them about decisions and respect and include them in his choices, he does the exact opposite at the end. 

I personally like that - it shows that some things are more important than respecting someone's opinion.",ri7eum

hoxhonc,"Or steer into Ned finding the glider and becoming Hobgoblin. 

Or even the demonic Demogoblin, leaning more into the Dr. Strange side of things.

And then there's Red Goblin, which is basically ""what if Carnage bonded with the Green Goblin?""

There's a whole lot of Goblin-related things they could do without falling back onto Norman Osborne again.",ri7eum

hozosi5,"Doesn't Ned become a Goblin?  I thought that's where they were going with the whole knives on the wall and the magic stuff.

hovqo1l,"Lol, no shitty triangle drama again please. That was one of the most horrible ideas in the first trilogy.",ri7eum
howkhsz,But MJ is going to leave for Boston and Spider Man probably will stay in New York. So it would be kind of weird having that as a plot point wouldn't it?,ri7eum

hp4v75e,"I wonder how that works, anyway? Is everything identical except that everyone thinks Spider-man never revealed his identity? Or do they have a weird gap in their memories where they can tell they should know this but just don't?

hpgn5k8,"I would have loved the old landlord show him in and he asks about the door, that would've been a great callback",ri7eum
how2cdf,I'm guessing he gets pretty dark in the next movie because the ending implies he decides it's better to be alone to keep others safe  And if there's one thing we've learned about Peter is that never ends well. My guess is his big redemption comes when he realizes pushing everyone away might keep them safe but it's their choice and that he needs friends/family the same way normal people need Spidey. They seem to be doing symbiote next and this arc would fit that perfectly imo.,ri7eum

An awkward ""ok thanks"" just didn't sit right.  A simple hug can be a powerful thing for a person who lost someone who meant everything for him and him blaming himself for it.

Stunning art and FX, beautiful panoramic images like swinging through the power lines and the 3SM flying at the villains, both of which could work as still frames hung on a wall.

Then suddenly two hours later we're seeing him move into his own place with a shitty landlord on his own about l accord and it feels completely natural!

I wish I could figure out what specifically he changes to pull that off, although maybe some of that apparent maturity is just from our mindset after seeing everything he goes through beforehand.",ri7eum
hp147ct,"I dunno, in his interaction with MJ, he shifts a bit. Suddenly I saw something in him that seemed genuinely more aged and wizened. Like obviously Peter is making a bad choice, but he thinks he's doing the hard and correct thing like an adult is supposed to, and something in his face reflected that to me. 

He's already grown as an actor tremendously since his first appearance, and I will not be surprised if he can suddenly carry himself with the confidence he'll need to carry on.",ri7eum
hp11o4a,I think simple things like his speech and line delivery change will do a lot on making him seem older. Maybe cut out his stuttering more as he goes to college or something. Imo that alone makes someone seem more mature than they already are.,ri7eum

hoxhnbl,"My head canon is that the spell wiped all MEMORIES of Peter, which includes computer memory. Otherwise, vision would remember him.

hoya9yr,"But if people‚Äôs memory of him ceases to exist then shouldn‚Äôt any record of him on paper vanish as well. He had a GED booklet in his box which probably indicates that he couldn‚Äôt continue high school because he has no high school record.

hoz4u60,"Pretty difficult to replace MJ's charisma and character though. We've had feisty independent MJ, just-as-intelligent Gwen, and Zendaya's excellent MJ; where do you go from there? Getting back with bashful Liz Toomes? The only feasible option I can see is Catwoman.",ri7eum

hox8v79,Why? We're clearly going to get more comic like Spidey now which is good!,ri7eum

Peter said that when you can do the things he can, and you have the power to help stop bad things happening to people, and you don't, they happen because of you. 

So it's probably his family teaching him what responsibility is from a young age and he's heard it all his life. 

May just reminded him. She saw he was headed down the wrong path when he said ""not my problem"" and wanted to send the villains back to their deaths.",ri7eum

In hindsight, though they are radically different characters, it's what I enjoyed about the Dark Knight Trilogy.",ri7eum
hp8t9je,"MJ and Neil both told him ""you'd better find me"" before the memory wipe, and Peter promised that he would. That was *their* choice. Even after everything they had experienced, all the risk and near-death experiences, they still wanted to stand by him.

Given how all of the previous Fantastic 4 films were bad, Marvel needs something to help bring in general audiences and having Spider-Man appear in the film is a good idea for that. Marvel has even done a similar tactic like this before with having Iron Man in Homecoming to bring in those who may have been burned by TASM2 or Hulk in Ragnarock for those who burned by Thor the Dark World.

It's not so much that the grieving scene was out of place, it's more that they had the scene go from Aunt May dying to a break of comedy with the scene changing to introducing Garfield and Maguire, then inserted the grieving scene. It's just an odd decision to have a moment like Aunt May dying then switch to a good chunk for comedic tone. As a viewer, I really didn't feel the impact of Mays death when followed up with such an important scene of introducing the other two Peters. It's like wow May died... Oh shit!!! That's Garfield!! Oh shit... That's Tobey.... Oh yeah May died... 

Just an odd choice to have the scenes like that. 

Personally, I don't find many of the jokes from Marvel funny, that's a matter of taste mostly. That's a me problem lol.

TBH I don't really understand why the villains were sent back in the first place. Forgetting Parker isn't a means to transporting back to another universe. Also, I guess that begs the question as to why they showed up in the first place. So, if I /must/ suspend the disbelief that the mindwipe cast out those who knew Peter Parker that were currently in the Hollandverse, then  I can suspend my disbelief that a parasitic life form who doesn't itself know but knows because its part of a collective, would not be ejected any more than it shouldn't've been there in the first place. Eddie however, because he is not part of a collective but only was  dragged along because Venom happens to know, then I guess it makes sense? idk writing this out just makes it more blegh",ri7eum

I think the Raimiverse is a more interesting playground than the Hollandverse for a few reasons:

1. It's not bound by the rules of the MCU.
2. It has its own unique character and atmosphere.
3. Tom Holland excels at fish out of water plots.

As for Tobey himself, I don't know what to say. The guy has some mileage on him. If it were up to me, I wouldn't have even included him in this version of the film unless you're also willing to draw on the fact that he's much older. But they did include him and didn't do much with him. And it's funny that you don't think this is a Tobey Spiderman movie, because the main villain is the first villain from Tobey's films.

With this film, he had the time to properly think about his decision when it came to the villains.

hpd86ui,"Seems like an extreme outlier, which happens a ton in comics. Even Thanos lost to Squirrel-girl. Even limiting to feats between 66 (his debut) and 79, standard Thor is shown to be for the most part leagues above even the strongest Spider-man. [Destroys a boulder the size of Chicago](https://imgur.com/a/9STAbTd), [can bench-press small planets](https://imgur.com/vUEgw55), [strikes powerful enough to destroy small planets](https://imgur.com/finqt7b), and [he fights and pulls a gigantic snake that can destroy the Earth](https://imgur.com/a/THLrovA). If we open the other 42 years worth of feats he has, then it becomes an even bigger wash.

We do see a glimpse of his true strength when Doc Ock gets Peter's body for a while and he punches Scorpion's jaw clean off. But there's a reason he's in the upper bound of ""street level""; as most of the other Avengers operate at a scale consistently higher than him.",ri7eum

Tom seems to be getting busy in his career and probs won't be interested doing the role soon. This movie had the best set up for a send off but instead they just mind fuck the whole thing. I'll laugh my ass off if Tom decides he doesn't want to do anymore movies so they just end this trilogy that covers 3 series with the most depressing note they could have ever given a spiderman movie.",ri7eum

i am also afraid they‚Äôll retcon the ending immediately in the next film. i really hope they keep it at least for a whole movie and then some, and make the revealing of his identity a big thing because i thoroughly enjoy the whole having a secret identity shenanigans lol",ri7eum
hpg7x72,"Wait. If everyone forgot who Spider-Man was (instead of Peter), do Ned and MJ still get into MIT?

Currently the admissions person presumably went back to MIT and said ""guys Spider-Man is a hero, and any Friend of Spider-Man is welcome in my book.""

But had Peter done what you suggested, they'd go ""Ned and MJ? Why did we reject them again? I don't remember... oh well. Too late.""

hpj0g9a,"I think the Sandman was just trying to get to the box to push the button and send everyone back, and didn't want to wait for the cure. Why he's attacking Peter so aggressively though is bc he's a villain?",ri7eum
ht2bd0u,"I agree. 

Obviously there's a lot of squinting you need to do around the magic stuff, but taking the movie on its own terms, it more or less makes sense.

EXCEPT for Sandman. Nothing actually changes between his agreeing to Peter's plan and his jumping out the window. I think they just decided there were too many villains to explain everyone's motivations, and hoped the audience would take it in stride.",ri7eum
hsq43qw,"Because Sandman wants the box as do the other two, they just differ on what they want with it. I assume there would be a fight after if they did succeed.",ri7eum

hpgu37g,"They were kind of in a situation where they needed to reach the endpoint (no one knows he's Spider-Man) in a way that isn't fully a victory, so there would be some moral growth.  Plus it had to be a bit of a rush job (for the characters) since they needed to maintain the time pressure during the climax.  Taking a lot of time to do some complex exposition and planning would have messed up the excitement of the moment.  This is a movie where magic serves as a vague background plot device to get the story to go where you need it to go, not the point of the story.  Time travel in Endgame serves the same function.  The rules aren't always clear or consistent but since they're mainly there to support the larger arc and aren't too central, I can accept a bit of hand-waving to push the story to its conclusion.",ri7eum

1. The first spell broke so it was bringing in everyone from every universe that knew Peter Parker was Spider-Man into Holland Universe.
2. Holland-Peter realized that this could be solved if Peter Parker didn‚Äôt exist at all in his universe since the only reason they were being summoned was because they knew the secret. So if there were no Peter Parkers linked to Spider-Man in this world, that would break the conditions of the first spell.",ri7eum

I think honestly they were more banking on the audience getting invested and forgetting about the other superheros, which I think will happen to most people since a lot is happening in the meantime. I still just think it was a little weak to give it away early that it worked. Kind of like why the army of the dead in RotK isn‚Äôt as satisfying as the return of Gandalf in two towers. Like you know something is coming in both but you leave a lot more suspense since you don‚Äôt know what Gandalf was doing or that the Roheran were coming.

hp5eub5,"> And seeing MJ but not being able to talk to her or share in their experiences probably feels no different than if they broke up normally

It's worse becuase he realized when he saw her band-aid that re-friending her would put her in danger, so he decides he can't ever try to rekindle those friendships with them",ri7eum
hp57q97,"Yeah, even though the day is saved, the ending is depressing as fuck. Peter's lost everything. He has no one left, not even his best friend, and he'll have to mourn alone.

This is honestly one of the darker MCU films. Somewhat surprising considering how lighthearted the previous Holland-Spidey films were.

And also, with this and Far From Home, MCU Spidey doesn't get too many happy endings. Homecoming is the only clear cut happy end and the rest are bittersweet, which admittedly is faithful to the spirit of the character in the comics.",ri7eum

But that happened after she empathized with him. Most people would be willing to clock a known and respected friend or even family member in the head with a pipe to stop them from murdering their closest family member. 

And AFTER all that, she still told Peter that they had done the right thing, so I don't think she had a change of heart.",ri7eum

I won't spoil too much, but something happens that leads to the then Avengers sitting around a table, with Cap asking ""How do we deal with xyz who just killed a villain? (who had been killing people prior to xyz showing up)""

At which point, Wolverine basically asks what the problem is. He's killed. Black Widow was a trained assassin. Cap killed plenty of Nazis. It's not like the Avengers don't have killers on the team. 

But like you said - some heroes are different. They don't kill, at any cost.",ri7eum

hp05s9x,You perfectly captured my thoughts on this. It goes back to that age old cliche of why batman doesn‚Äôt kill his foes and instead sends them to Arkham yet these villains have no remorse in killing people over and over.

It gets repeated a lot in the book, how one moment we are walking talking animated people, human beings, a fucking person. And a second later, we can be just so much meat and bone, lying on the floor already beginning to decay. 

That thought also probably wouldn‚Äôt have been such a big deal to me if my mother didn‚Äôt drop dead the same day I handed in the paper. Like a bolt of lighting from the sky, sent by Thor or Odin himself, somebody I knew in IRL and loved and had loved every second of my existence stopped existing. They were talking and laughing, and then they weren‚Äôt doing anything. Shit happens, and then it just stops happening. No fanfare or music or warning.

hp0br4b,"It's curious--I actually loved the more realistic armor of the Goblins in the Raimi films.

hownzts,"Definitely the case in my theater; people loved and cheered Andrew's entrance, but we all collectively freaked out at Tobey",ri7eum
hox6g8x,"I think it goes a lot deeper than that honestly. Andrew's Spidey talks about how he never really got over Gwen and he obviously doesn't have a lot going as Peter. He purely sees himself as Spider-Man.. Tobey's Spidey on the other hand, has a loving, albeit complicated, relationship with MJ, and he's had more experience and time to deal with the loss of Harry and whatever failure he felt letting Goblin and Ock die. Him showing up in his street clothes to me just shows he's much more comfortable as Pete, where Andrew hides himself a bit behind the suit.

Just my two cents.",ri7eum
hownqag,"I think it‚Äôs more like that people loves amazing suit. As soon as the portal open, i could already tell that its andrew because of the suit and especially the eye.",ri7eum
howybbq,It‚Äôs funny because I went to a late night showing and it was full of young people who had the opposite reaction. When Andrew Garfield came out of the portal the place exploded. Someone even yelled out ‚ÄòBest Spider-Man!‚Äô which got a second cheer. People were still psyched to see Tobey Maguire but nowhere near as loud as Garfield.,ri7eum

hox2jhm,"I grew up with Tobey as well and loved the movies but always knew their weaknesses. What got me was how underrated Garfield's Spider-Man was. His Peter was odd sure, being this edgey skater punk persona, but as Spider-Man? Literally no one has done it better. Even Holland, who can be quippy and fun but a lot of the retorts are from ignorance and self doubt.

&#x200B;

Tobey's Peter was just too lame for me to latch onto the character despite his suit being my favorite for a long time, also the movies, in general, were really goofy even back then. We just had more of a tolerance for that tone.",ri7eum

hp2s9fg,"Flash as Agent Venom would fit perfectly imo.

Let him get the suit, Venom with a new voice begins telling him about a guy he once knew but cannot remember anymore. He just remembers being a Hero for people and thinks that's what he's supposed to do. Flash idolizing Spider-Man finally realizes his dream of being a superhero too.

You then have Flash over the course of the movie get knocked down a peg or two as he continuously fails at saving the day because of his ego and dick-ish attitude. Venom says ""fuck this, you suck kid"" and leaves him. Flash then grows a pair and figures out how being a Hero is and goes off to stop the villain anyway. Venom the entire time watching from a distance sees Flash can be a Hero and jumps in to help him.

Boom. You now redeem Flash's character, Venom doesn't have to be a one-note villain anymore and turns into more of his classic anti-hero/hero vibe and you can have a sweet Agent Venom & Spider-Man team-up movie in the MCU right after against MCU's The Sinister Six (Vulture, Scorpion, Shocker, Mysterio II, Morbius & Kingpin).",ri7eum

So i assume him and MJ are together. On a second viewing I'd like to hunt for a ring. 

Garfield's character could make sense that he's alone, doesn't mean he hasn't tried to date, a run in with black cat could suit him well.

The villain was set up fantastically, the motives for all characters were clear, Peter was getting destroyed / punished for trying to over-extend himself and do everything at once, etc. Just a perfect mix of over-the-top and down-to-earth all around. The arms not being CGI is still doing wonders for the film to this day.  


I also felt like some villains in NWH didn't quite need to be ""cured"". Doc especially, because he came to his senses at the end and did a remarkably heroic sacrifice. All throughout the movie (Spiderman2) you could see he was genuine and was acting for the benefit of mankind and you were able to see how his perspective got twisted by physical trauma, loss of his wife and being shunned by the public all in a few hours. Not to mention the microchip frying...  


I dunno it just felt right. And I just prefer Tobey as BOTH Peter and Spiderman, I think he did it just fine. IMO Tom is TOO much energy for both, but its not bad at all. I mostly dislike Tom's Spidey, its too playful and cheery during intense fights that make it seem like the whole situation is happening on a 6 year-old's playtable, but not to say a lax attitude isn't a common theme among spidermen. I also think modern MCU just shoves in jokes as much as it can in all movies, some of it being okay, and that's how it is.

To each his own though. I do feel like if we had the technology and Marvel storytelling experience of today but in the early 2000's, and Sony gave Raimi the space he needed to properly explore his vision of the story, Tobey would be much more appreciated. But NWH proves in so many ways that we would not have what we have today if it weren't for the Raimi trilogy. In my opinion.",ri7eum

Oh, my bad, I didn't realize we were talking about Endgame before. I think you may be on the wrong thread, though.

This movie in particular let pretty much all of its big emotional moments be big and emotional without cutting the flow with jokes. May's death, the first Spider-Men reunion at the roof, Andrew reediming himself by saving MJ, Tobey stopping Tom from killing Green Goblin and Peter's goodbye all went smoothly without unnecessary quips. The movie mantained the dark and gloomy tone throughout in a way that most other MCU fail to do.

Sure, it had *some* quipping, but it was mostly contained to MCU tie ins like Doctor Strange and Happy and like two or three memes from the old movies. It was clear that they tried to restrict the influence of the MCU and let the Spider-Man characters carry the plot. Throwing away the entire movie because just because it's part of the MCU is a really shitty take, especially with this one, which did a lot to not fall victim to its mannerisms.",ri7eum

Without saying a word, Peter pulls a carton of eggs out from his backpack/jacket, and hands it to his worried aunt.

With Felicia he wouldn't have to worry about that. Although I'm sure he'll inevitably get back with MJ. Which once again can still work.

His line to Peter after he gets defeated about ""going back to being a nobody"" almost felt like an obligatory shoe-in to remind us that this was supposed to continue his arc from ASM2, and Foxx's line delivery didn't even seem all that convinced of it either.

how4m14,It's consistent with his character though. He made a lot of short sighted shit choices. Seeing him make another doesn't seem like a plot hole to me.

But they did *so* much right that they get a pass on that nitpick from me.,ri7eum
howh0jy,How is that a plot hole,ri7eum
howchri,"I don't understand why you think it's a plot hole. Consistently his motivation was getting home to see his daughter no matter what. His way of doing that was to press the button on the box to trigger that happening. Initially he was in Strange's prison so couldn't get to it. Then he was outside of Strange's prison, but didn't know where the box was because MJ and Ned were keeping it secret.

He played along with Peter because Peter was intending to send them back after he'd cured them. He didn't care about the cures at all because it was just a means to an end. Then when the villains all decided to forgo their cures and he discovered where the box was he tried to take it for himself to go home because, again, he never cared about the cures at all.

Yes. Peter might've sent them all back after he'd cured the other villains, but why would Sandman care to help with that when there was no guarantee that Peter could actually cure them all and while he was trying to cure the resisting villains they wanted to destroy the box he needed to get home? Why would he risk the single thing he wanted when he could just take the box and send himself home?",ri7eum
hoxjveg,"He's in a completely different universe that he never asked to come to,   surrounded by dead men and complete unknowns.  No one responds well to being abducted and he's already prone to making bad choices.   All and all I think he held to up pretty well until things went tits up and he was done with this world.",ri7eum
hsxdvc1,"Late reply, probably Green Goblin and Electro due. Electro already made it clear he wants to stay, so the due is likely to destroy the box. Which, in his perspective, was the only ticket to go home. The duo is resisting so he likely saw a chance that Spider-man would fall and the box will get destroyed. So he feels the need to press the button *now* and not after he's cured.

Prison visit is a thing, so prison has more chance to let him meet his daughter than trapped in another universe.",ri7eum

Then I followed up by watching the Tobey trilogy and realized the first one, while a classic, doesn't fully hold up.  Andrew's first was arguably better and I think he's a lot more engaging as an actor.  Tobey mostly is just awkward.   Tobey's 2nd is a great movie in large part because Alfred Molina is outstanding in it.  

Long way of saying, my biggest takeaway from re-watching them all now was that I didn't think I needed to see any more of Tobey, but Andrew really shines on screen and it was a shame his run abruptly ended.

How does Peter Parker being anonymous affect Spider Man being in the MCU?

SPIDER MAN is a superhero who helped defeat thanos and who 'killed' Mysterio. 

Everyone in the MCU knows these things. SPIDER MAN is still in the MCU.

They DON'T KNOW who the MAN under MASK is. They have no idea who the identity is of Spider Man. They don't know it's Peter Parker. No one knows who Peter Parker even is.

Rest assured that anything that existed regarding who Peter is or was no longer exists in people's minds or in any record currently referencable. We see a glimpse of a GED study guide in his box of affects - now why do you think a kid who just graduated high school and had a shot at MIT would need a study guide for the GED? Wouldn't be able to just reference his transcripts?

Well, it's a note to tell us that every record and every moment of Pete's existence has been wiped from the earth. He will start over, probably make it to ESU, and away we go. It's the same as JJ relaying how they don't know who is under the mask, calling them a coward. We can infer then that the footage they have no longer exists. 

The events that occurred before then have still happened. Nothing in the timeline changes - only their records of it - their memories. Think of it as collective global amnesia with a dash of identity erasure. Sure, folks may seek that answer of who Spider-Man is, but they'll have a real hard time with that since literally nobody knows who Peter is.",ri7eum
hpx1mea,"You‚Äôre thinking too deep.

If we use the brother analogy, it‚Äôs like knowing that you know your mom through your brother, but who your brother is, you don‚Äôt know. You know you have one, but the identity of which is forgotten.

Just like the movie: Happy knows Aunt May is Spider Man‚Äôs aunt, but who is Spider Man? He worked with him, but he can‚Äôt for the life of him remember who it was supposed to be.",ri7eum
hp6h0ie,"Exactly. 

I do not remember is a valid answer. Maybe it bothers him and he tries to look into it. Maybe he simply accepts that, after working with heroes, a masked hero doesn't deserve to be unmasked.

But the effect of this spell looks pretty damn effective. There's no real way to connect everything Spider-Man did to Peter because as far as the world is concerned Peter likely never really existed. He's studying for the GED, given the box of stuff.

We can infer from this that even official records are wiped.",ri7eum

I think it worked great though, because it let Garfield‚Äôs Peter come off as just excited to be included which is a welcome change from how angsty he was in The Amazing Spider-Man movies.",ri7eum
hovvb25,"> A bit emotional and corny?

He played Peter the most like an actual teenager, cringe included.",ri7eum
howrnog,"It didn‚Äôt catch me that off guard though. If you remember what he said about after he lost Gwen, he talked about how he felt so alone and filled with rage. I think him being there finally being able to related to people who know is exact struggle just sent his emotional self into overdrive. Even when he saw Tom with his MJ you could tell he longed to have someone as well and Toby asks if he has someone and he says it‚Äôs not in the cards for guys like us.

And I don't think that it's suspicious ig that he has stark tech coz well he fought in it in endgame and infinity war but let's see. I wonder if the world remembers what happened in far from home and his use of Edith. I wonder if that again was re-activated as no one can now have access to except Peter,ri7eum

It's not 100% clear what time of year it is in Endgame (spring?) but there was some time before Peter started 11th grade, which we see in Far From Home. The bulk of this movie takes place in October of his 12th grade year.

So...at least there's that?",ri7eum
hpeghz3,"So glad they didn't do it because it would have been too fan-servicy and ""for the meme"" in a movie packed to the brim with enough of it (fan-service done right, I would add), but it would have been kind of hilarious if they had Tom Holland's Spider-man say ""I missed the part where that's my problem"" at any point.",ri7eum

Making spiderman a genius sponsored kid with an iron man suit going to MIT ruins it precisely because the core message of spiderman is rising up from adversity.     

I would argue Garfields spiderman failed in exactly the same way- if Peter Parker is a charismatic popular and smart kid then there is literally no reason why he would choose to be a vigilante saving the world with his powers.   

The hulk is currently in exactly the same situation- the core of the character is missing.

ismu0am,"Yeah. This movie was great, but at the same time it was a bad movie.

1) Doctor Strange would NEVER cast a spell undoing the memories of everyone in the universe. That's a powerful spell. It didn't even look like he needed consent from Peter first. Sure he got consent, but there was no... Talisman or something. It's a powerful spell. Why didn't he use it on Thanos, or any other villain. It's insane. Such a violation.

2) Iron man chose Peter to be the next iron man, to protect the citizens of earth with the heart he has shown. All of that tossed away. 

3) In the end, he broke his promises to both his Best Friend and his girlfriend.

 You‚Äôre right that the magicians believe the soul is the consciousness and astral projection is removing the soul from the body. But Strange doesn‚Äôt understand the nature of Peter‚Äôs body.

To me this scene (the fact that his body could still act without his soul) seemed to be implying that Peter‚Äôs nervous system has an awareness and consciousness of its own. I think this is yet another subtle new insight on the extent of his powers, specifically the level of intelligence of his ‚Äúspidey sense‚Äù. 

We see this as moments when his body or nerves are aware of something before he is conscious of it and he needs to time to catch up to what his body knows. But this scene implies that this sense is a totally independent physical awareness capable of acting on its own, separate from his soul.

they did mention like 3x ned would *never* be one of spidermans enemies hint hint, we already see he has skills with magic so maybe he will go crazy one day and fight PP knowing he never knew him would be an easy storyline to write

hp0qfi4,"your kidding right? The bending rules/taking risks was something we only saw in the Dr Strange movie. This was a Strange who was still in a way like a child when it comes to magic. In Infinity War, they establish a far more mature Strange who is 100% committed to protecting the universe at any cost. Why? because Strange learned a powerful lesson in his solo movie -- ""Its not about you"". the ancient one taught Strange that the universe is so vast (and needs protecting) that his problems on Earth are like small rocks in the ocean. This is how the MCU establishes Strange as the Sorcerer Supreme. Heck, in Endgame, the ancient one (who at the time is the sorcerer supreme) tells Hulk that she won't risk giving away the time stone and helping Banner because disrupting the flow of time is too risky. Its only when she tells him that Strange, who is the present sorcerer supreme, was the one who gave away the stone. She obliges because she knows that as the sorcerer supreme, Strange knows whats best to keep the universe/multiverse safe. So again, tell me, why would Strange do something so risky all for Peter, whose not even a close friend of his, knowing what we know about Strange's character.

hoxi0il,"I meant comic book Spidey, the classic one, eh also routinely makes some goddamn baffling choices; chief among them involuntarily killing Gwen Stacy; so much, that for years it has haunted him, and several times over the years, different authors have used that experience to point out all th eother ways he could have done things that he didn't because he was overconfident.  


Even in this movie, it throws back to classic comics, in the original; Peter was about to murder the Goblin when he reacts, just like he does in this movie (if you equal Toby's spidey to OG Spidey) and stops -in the movie, literally - himself from doing it.  


He doesn't choose to save the villains because he is stupid, he realizes it would be effectively murdering them, even if they are ""not real"", and Strange cannot confirm if they will die or their fates can be changed.  In fact, out of grief he regresses into ""it's not my problem"" territory, plainly states he doesnt care anymore.  Peter is even reluctant to actually help them and only starts cheering when it actually works on ""fixing"" Otto and it's during this scene, where it's implied Norman has been sweet talking him for hours, that he gets BETRAYED, not duped.  Osborn doesn't even sabotage the new AI control chip, he is just calmly waiting for an opportunity to strike and does so because he knows the cure will work on him, so he also recruits sand man and electro on the spot.

This Peter has no way to know just how devious Osborn is, or how strong; remember Tobey's spidey had a much harder time fighting Otto (and in his own movie, he actually LOSES the second fight too, and has to appeal to Otto's humanity) while Holland Spidey could match Otto blow for blow even before overriding the tentacles.   And really, everyone except for Norman was going along with the cure plan, from Spidey point of view, he has everything under control, and you only think he is stupid because YOU know the Goblin can't be trusted.",ri7eum

In terms of people hating Spider Man because of the mysterio shit - which makes no sense, he still helped saved the goddamn universe from Thanos - I think is somewhat believable in terms of the news taking shit and running with it, just because media in our lives spews a bunch of horse shit as well.

About Carnage. Yeah he could've been pulled to this universe too. But Strange contained things. Not everyone made it through.

This is implied by the conversation between Happy and Peter (in which Happy says he met May through Spider-man); the fact that MJ still has the necklace thingy Peter gave her in Far From Home; or by the very fact that MJ and Ned are going to MIT I‚Äôd say, because in the whole process of meandering, the MIT lady talked only to Peter (while also knowing he‚Äôs Spider-man), and she‚Äôd have to remember the conversation she had with him to accept Ned and MJ in the end, but she remembers ‚Äòhim‚Äô only as Spider-Man ‚Äî it‚Äôs messy, but I guess she‚Äôd remember being helped by Peter somehow if Spider-man was the one erased.

At the same time, I think the logic is disregarded when it comes to Ned and MJ seemingly not remembering being involved in the triple Spidey fight (even though they should, only forgetting Spider-man‚Äôs identity), or Ned probably having forgotten his magical developments. However, I only got the impression this is the case from the scene in the end, it‚Äôs is not stated they don‚Äôt remember being there, I just assumed because they are so chill and because seems more likely story-telling wise.

Post Endgame the snap is such a non-issue that I don't think it should be considered. Peter didn't even lose out on graduation when he was snapped, he faced no hardship whatsoever from it happening.

It's literally the only on-screen issue we've seen him have besides Tony dying.

Did we watch a different series? This Peter wasn't poor by any stretch and seemed to be solidly middle class throughout. There wasn't any subplots about struggling to make rent, pay his aunt's medical bills, having to cut corners to save a buck here or there, shit he didn't even have a job. 

>He lost his parents, he lost his uncle Ben.

Those happened before he was even introduced in Civil War. Neither is ever mentioned and, at least when compared to the other two Peters talking about their Uncle Ben, I would hesitate to say such a character even existed in the MCU. 

>Finally, he gets his big break because Tony Stark notices his heroics and takes him on as an apprentice. 

This is where it actually starts, everything before it relies on stories and events that have no real reason to be believed to have happened or been significant in the MCU.

>His life stays relatively the same because while he has a high tech suit, his bills aren‚Äôt magically paid. 

What bills? 

>He doesn‚Äôt want to be a universal superhero,

He literally wants that exact thing up until Far From Home and is then cool with it again by the end of that film.

You're mixing general Spider-Man mythos into the MCU version that simply isn't there. This movie provided the first major consequence for Peter's being Spider-Man and using May as a proxy for Ben hardly counts as a unique problem. That's usually an origin thing and not the 6th appearance of the character. Outside of this singular (and fundamental) aspect of the character the only loss or struggle whatsoever was of Tony dying.

Since watching NWH the first time, I've been wondering about the whole Venom thing, since this version had not met Spidey at all. Why the interest in him if the tv was the first time he'd seen him. Not sure why the symbiote hive mind can transcend the multiverse when up until recently, it wasn't even common knowledge that there was such a thing.

A scene in the movie, which would make no sense otherwise, was when they had the discussion about their villains, and Tobey mentions a black suited monster version of himself or something like that.

hpkjue8,"Maybe I just don't exactly follow your interpretation of the scene. Are you suggesting that at the end of the movie, Peter has 100% decided to completely give up on the possibility of trying to bring MJ and Ned back into his life and is essentially breaking his promise? Because that's not my take at all. There's no doubt an element of his hesitation and inaction as him considering if maybe it is for the best that they don't know him at all. And that's not an unreasonable take away to have at the ending. But I feel like the ending is a little more open-ended than that. I personally don't think he just decided to go ""fuck my promise"" and completely cut them out of his life. I really think it's the sort of thing where we're supposed to see it more as a setback to their relationship that can't be quickly fixed and wrapped up neatly at the end of this movie, but it's ok because even if they can't get back to where they were, MJ and Ned are going to be fine either way. But I didn't come away from that scene thinking ""Well, that's definitely the last time he's ever going to see MJ and Ned."" Maybe I'm just reading too far into it, but it feels like the movie tries to drop multiple hints that this isn't the end of their relationship. Garfield Spider-man mentions how relationships aren't in the cards for them, and Maguire tells him that's not necessarily true and that he and MJ ""made it work"" despite it being complicated. The last thing Peter says to MJ in the movie is ""see you around,"" which isn't something I personally go around saying to people that I have no intention of ever seeing again, even if it is a friendly way of saying goodbye to someone. And we see another cup of coffee (presumably from the donut shop) at Peter's apartment. Maybe it's just the same cup of coffee or maybe the movie is trying to hint that Peter's been frequenting the donut shop more than once.",ri7eum

Assuming you're a doctor that starts off on the low end of the salary spectrum, let's say $150,000, and you use 50K of your income to pay off your student debt, then you'd be debt free in about 5 years when you also consider post graduate interest rates for student loans.

For some people it sounds like an impossible task, but for other people it's a given that they'll get into some kind of elite school, and while MIT is elite even among elites it's only marginally better than like Georgia Tech or Stanford or various prestigious state schools like Berkeley. 

As an example, I for some people taking any APs in high school is seen as an amazing opportunity reserved only for the best and brightest. Other people take 20 AP courses and don't realize that's unusual. Based on the high school Peter attends, it's likely he and his friends are in the latter group. They're already at an elite institution, and very much in the pipeline to be placed at another elite institution. Getting into MIT wouldn't be pulling them out of obscurity, it would just be a more expensive and slightly higher quality school with better name recognition.

Tom‚Äôs spidy still needed to grow and have his ‚Äúorigin‚Äù story plot, he needed a deeper sense of pain to bear since that‚Äôs true of all the spidies. His pain was loosing his friendships.

They didn't say anything about Marko being an exception to that rule, so I assume the blanket statement applies to him too. This would mean that after Spider-Man 3 he probably fought spidey again, and died. Though there is the out that the portal was bringing people across the multiverse that knew Peter was Spider-Man, not just people who died fighting him. So we can head canon that he didn't fight Spidey again, and that they just didn't mention the difference he had with the others.",ri7eum

I guess Tom Holland's Spidey senses didn't work there either, but hey... At least he could sense Norman Osborne turning into the green goblin again.... Makes perfect sense that he can sense internal danger from another human being, but can't sense the same guy about to stab Tobey.",ri7eum
hozjgp2,"Molina and Dafoe were each wonderful in Spider-Man 1 and 2, Raimi's only big mistake there was putting Dafoe in a mask, and so one of the nicest parts of them being *astoundingly good* in this movie was that it didn't feel like they had changed any, it was just a genuine continuation of these two characters rather than feeling disconnected at all.  I believe 100% that these guys got plucked out of their own universes at the very moment they learned that Spider-Man is Peter Parker, and they can *still* go bonkers and give it absolutely everything because they both went pretty nuts in their own movies as well.",ri7eum

I guess my hanging point is that I can use your same logic for any superhero -> ""RDJ is great as Iron man with great facial expressions, never show his mask again!"" -> ""Hugh Jackman is great as Wolverine with great facial expressions, never show his mask again"" and so on. If you have issues with the original GG mask (which I personally don't) I can respect that and I do understand because of how great Defoe is.

Obviously, the admissions lady didn't have an influence in this reality since she never met Peter.

1.) He has already had five movies of that exact plot line. I have no issue with them doing something MCU-specific with the character. 

2.) Peter does experience adversity in these films that only he can solve because other Heroes in the MCU have wildly different attitudes on how their villains should be handled. They are routinely fucked however by the ever-evolving nature of the MCU. 

They never got to explore the fallout of Liz Allan and Vulture because of IW and Endgame, and they immediately handwaved the consequences of the last film because they wanted to do a nostalgia-bait Multiverse movie instead of naturally ending this saga. 

3.) Peter overcomes nothing in this film. 

Hulk I do agree with because he isn't given the proper space to explore his nuances and hasn't had nearly as many films that explore it well.

hp2v08o,"Those are traits that are expressed more in the other films as they built those characters. Of course the other spideys would try to help those in certain conditions because they saw them turn into it and they felt it was their responsibility, to some extent, to fix it or at least attempt to save them. That part is true IN THOSE UNIVERSES 

But what have we seen from MCU‚Äôs spidey that leads us to believe he would be the same? Is that what the FEAST thing is for? To imply they‚Äôre these people without actually showing it?

Because how do they show Holland‚Äôs Spider-Man is someone looking to help change those who need it when Vulture and Mysterio just showed up with little to no relation to him. They were randoms

So this is the first film where they have to give it a go but outside of knowing that those guys ‚Äúallegedly‚Äù (he doesn‚Äôt know this) died in their own universe‚Ä¶what relationship does he have with them that makes him want to help them change even tho they clearly didn‚Äôt want to change in the beginning?

What you‚Äôre saying makes sense in the other films but it also seems like you‚Äôre just gifting Holland these same traits even tho the past two movies weren‚Äôt set up to show him as that person. Also keep in mind that those optimistic traits spidey has that make him want to help others are active traits but the spidey in the last two movies was a passive character (kinda. In far from home he was kinda active but him being active was giving Mysterio EDITH which was basically him kinda giving up). Things happened to him and he was dragged from points A to B instead of making things happen and pushing the story forward  

So I do agree with what you‚Äôre saying about spidey and his family as a whole and as it relates to the other spideys but this specific spidey was never gifted any of that on screen. The best we could say is that he wanted to help because Aunt May just told him to but Strange also told him not to help and seeing as how he‚Äôs been a passive character for homecoming and far from home‚Ä¶it makes more sense that he wouldn‚Äôt help until he absolutely had to. Maybe you can argue that‚Äôs the case when he found out they died in their own timeline but he, in his current position, doesn‚Äôt know that to be true at all so why would he just believe that?",ri7eum

Because any admissions committee would think twice about letting any known superhero attend their institution, given that superheroes bring supervillains with them (I'm reminded of Andrew's poor high school getting thrashed by Lizard in Amazing 1).

Or did you find it unrealistic that the kids didn't apply to any state universities where admission is, I assume based on your previous posts, easier or outright guaranteed to get into? Because given their backgrounds as top students at a specialized high school for smart kids, I don't think it is surprising at all that they'd not even consider having to go to a state school until after it was their only option, and even once there they'd probably still think of having to go to such a school as being a crushing failure.

Comics did something along those lines  
After Civil War (and another storyline it's better left unmentioned), Dr. Strange created a ""psychic blindspot"" that basically shielded Peter from having his identity revealed (and also having everyone forget that his secret identity)  
No matter how much evidence there was about Peter being Spider-Man, people wouldn't be able to connect the dots.

* Peter is the grizzled mentor thing but also exploring an Parent/Kid hero relationship which is something we haven't gotten really either. Hank/Hope and Scott/Cassie(hopefully) are the only ones we really have so far.

You can't act like he has no agency in this decision when he fights his friend Doctor Strange over their positions on the issue.

If we consider this ""phisical things remain the same but people forget and rationalize"" theory true, news websites and journals containing news regarding Mysterio's death would remain the same, so they would still state that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. The big billboards with his face would still be there, and everyone would just do a bit of research before finding out again that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.

To fix this huge plot-hole I think physical objects also changed as a result of the spell, otherwise people would quickly realize something weird happened to reality.

I don't even think Marc Webb is a bad director it's just that Sony is notorious for meddling in their movies. 

It's basically what made Spider-Man 3 not very good and kind of disappointed Sam Raimi since he has such a love of the character. They basically forced him to include the other villains so they could sell more toys.

On another note, have you given any thought to the fact that the spell pulled the Spideys from a set point in time, and pulled the villains from the past? When they go back, they go to different points in time (villains and Spideys)? Another timeline is created for the villains I guess?",ri7eum

It‚Äôs not explained, but it‚Äôs assumed the spell deals with records in general (much like Hermione‚Äôs spell in the last Harry Potter). It is a fair assumption because the spell in the start of the movie would have zero use if digital records weren‚Äôt affected, because the world learned about Spidey‚Äôs identity through social media.

As to how it does it, and it‚Äôs speculation of course, it could be that the records are actually erased and/or physically altered by the spell.

This is why they can‚Äôt directly go back and change the future (e.g. killing baby Thanos), they‚Äôd only be saving an alternative timeline.

When Cap travels to return the stones, it is to prevent the disruption of the respective timelines from which the stones were taken, the ‚Äòmain timeline‚Äô was already saved (this is by the explanation of the movie, it doesn‚Äôt really hold up as well).

The implications are: Cap couldn‚Äôt be sitting there in the bench in the end, since we are in the ‚Äòmain timeline‚Äô (unless he somehow travelled back from this other Peggy timeline and sat in the bench pretending he was there the whole time); He‚Äôd have to had spent his time with an effectively different Peggy than the one he met; there‚Äôd have to be a second Steve Rogers in the timeline he went to the whole time; He‚Äôd have to not warn anyone about all the evil things he came to learn were occurring during this ‚Äònew‚Äô lifetime (such as the Hydra corruption of Shield, the torture and slaving of Bucky, and the incoming doom of Thanos) for the events of the ‚Äòmain timeline‚Äô to unfold.

That's Spider-Man.

Still, it's heartbreaking and I'm surprised and impressed Marvel/Disney committed to something that somber. Peter may not be dead, but it feels like a sacrifice on the same level as Tony's in Endgame.

I would definitely say it's the bleakest ending for an MCU film since Infinity War. It gave me that same feeling of rising dread as I realized everything wasn't gonna be okay by the end. Like I kept hoping  Strange found some kind of loophole like Morgan Freeman at the end of Bruce Almighty. Or that MJ and Ned were just pranking him and they still remembered, or that Peter would just tell them. And when Happy showed up it got my hopes up. It's painful but you cant say it's not an ending that stays with you.

I had my criticisms at first (Iron Man Jr.) but the MCU is doing an incredible job with this character. Like he's been on a journey since Civil War, and at this point, he can stand toe-to-toe with the MCU Avengers as far as character arcs.

Peter, Thor, and Wanda are the most tragic MCU characters right now. I would have included Bucky, but things look like they're finally starting to turn around for him.

WE know how they were, but he doesn't til it's too late. He was also able to handle a couple of them without too much difficulty and while avoiding casualties (not necessarily realizing that that relative ease of victory was mainly because of their disorientation from the transition and unfamiliarity with factors in this universe). One of them actively helped him capture another too, so he had reason to buy into the idea the could be rehabilitated. 

Plus, they listened to him, so he had reason to think the cooperation would work...other than Lizard. They could've left him in the cell instead of the not so secure containment of a regular ass van lol.",ri7eum

To me that's what makes him who he is as a character. He will do anything in his power to save everyone. Also he doesn't know the villains like we do from our 3rd party perspective he literally just met them so there not particularly villains in his eyes especially after seeing Norman back to his old self.",ri7eum

Actually I think she must have been mainly influenced by Norman, practically projecting his misery to all the others - and acting like a mom and general helpful person she is, she wanted to help them.

Matt being Foggy's hero while he battled cancer was so touching. Funny thing is, I had only started picking up Daredevil because I'll read anything that has Samnee's art in it.

The last Daredevil issue I've read was, I think a couple of years ago, when Matt was going through some serious depression issues and couldn't tell what was what. That was interesting.

Masks have been a major part of super hero culture forever because they allow secret identities and/or protection and defense. I see the value in keeping a mask on while sacrificing a bit of facial expression. I think the first Spiderman handled this extremely well by showing masks most of the time, while removing them (through damage) for the last fight. I'm fine if a hero doesn't wear a mask, I just hate when they take them off in the middle of a fight, particularly if they need the mask for protection. Like Iron man should never take off his mask since he needs it for protection. It makes no logical sense to remove the mask for Iron man since it weakens the hero",ri7eum

hph9lsa,"wait... are we... are we really doing this? fuck it, we're doing this.

ok first of all.

Magic Ned kinda irks me the wrong way. i mean if they had somehow hinted at something to establish this in a previous movie, i'd be down. but this just kinda comes out of nowhere and seems like it was a convenience for the writers. ""oh i know, Ned can use a sling ring somehow, even though Doctor Strange - *the Sorcerer Supreme -* struggled with it initially. we'll just make some joke about it."" also don't like this trend of all Asians in the MCU being magical. even Agent Woo is into magic. :) when i saw Wong in Shang-Chi, i thought ""that's cool, but why did it have to be Wong? it could have been anyone. is it because he's asian? what's next? they give Ned some powers and he teams up with Shang-Chi?"" then, well, i laughed a little too hard to myself during that scene in NWH.

next, how exactly did the initial spell work again?

so if you know Peter Parker is Spider-Man, or if you've bonded with a symbiote that has multiversal knowledge that Peter Parker is Spider-Man (even though you don't recognize any Spider-Man's on TV) then you got pulled in from the present. but if you were killed from a battle with Spider-Man, then you were brought in right before the moment that you were killed. but if you're the Sandman or the Lizard, then you just randomly get pulled in from when you fought Spider-Man, but didn't die. also, if you're Electro, then you don't actually have to know that Peter Parker is Spider-Man (or at least you don't have to know his race?). Also shouldn't there have been like an infinite number of Venoms/Eddie Brocks pulled in (since they ALL share multiversal knowledge?) it's lucky they didn't run into any of them. question: if a rogue Venom from another universe lands in a random place in the MCU like Ohio (so we never saw him), and he eats some innocent person's head, then that person from Ohio is still dead at the end of this movie, right? can't fix everything i guess. also, like the present version of Kirsten Dunst's MJ would also have been pulled in too, right? she's gotta be somewhere in the MCU during this movie, lost and scared. i dunno, Tobey wasn't concerned at all. maybe that's why their relationship ""got complicated""?

then you have the repercussions of them fixing all the villains and returning them to their respective timelines. how do the events from Loki, that occurred outside of time, fit into all of this? it'd be a shame if they sent all those cured villains back, only to have the TVA step in and prune the whole universe anyways. and if the TVA isn't around, then the Spider-Men have effectively robbed young Tobey and young Andrew of the lessons that they learned in their respective movies, creating so much potential havoc in those worlds. Peter Parker is the type to grow from tragedy. does Peter really learn that he has a burden of great responsibility if someone else with great power fixed his problem for him? if the Lizard is sent back cured, does Captain Stacey live? then would The Amazing Spider-Man 2 even happen if Captain Stacey was around? similarly, if you cure Norman Osborne and give him the knowledge of the events from NWH, then send him back to Spider-Man 1, does Otto Octavius even become Doctor Octopus? Norman (not Harry) would be running Oscorp and he'd be like ""uh, i wouldn't rely too much on that inhibitor chip"". maybe he doesn't even fund Otto's experiment at all since he's not chasing clout like Harry was. then if there's no Doc Ock, do Tobey and Kirsten Dunst ever end up together?

just so many things to think about, and the more i do... i swear, i enjoyed the movie though! but my initial reaction (being honest here) wasn't an immediate 10/10. there was just a little too much happening, and it felt like 3 movies packed into one. hard to describe, but it felt ""sony-fied"". i mean, probably the best execution we could have asked for given what it was, but... just overall too different. too much stuff and going bigger rather than better. i missed the John Hughes analogue and focus that the previous MCU Spider-Man movies had. the best analogy i can describe my feeling is that... Spider-Man Homecoming was like a restaurant making a perfect club sandwich. then Spider-Man Far From Home was like a perfect steak sandwich. then i was like man, i can't wait to see what kind of sandwich they make next, and instead they deliver like a Thanksgiving plate. and each component on the plate is done really well. like, these are the best candied yams i've ever had. but, i'm just not a fan of candied yams in general though, and wish they had made a perfect thanksgiving sandwich instead.

the Spider-Man franchise is fascinating though, because they're trying some innovative stuff. they were the first to do an ""immediate reboot"" bringing in Tom Holland while Garfield was still fresh in everyone's minds. they made it work. then in this movie, they've essentially rebooted the character AGAIN, but kept it within canon and with the same actor. nobody's done that before. but everything that made the MCU Spider-Man unique (hot May, this version of Ned/MJ/Flash, Stark tech, experiences with the Avengers) all that is now gone. i expect the next solo Spider-Man movie to feel completely different from Homecoming and Far From Home. and i bet Sony's gonna try to revive ideas they had for Black Cat and Sinister Six, and try to connect it to future Spider-Man movies starring Tom Holland.",ri7eum

He would probably would not know where the second Rogers is frozen up as he himself was woken up in New York and conscious during the retrieval.

Dr. Strange, despite trying to be a mentor to Peter in a sense to make up for the loss of Stark (he likely feels some lingering guilt over it) just immediately jumps into doing the spell without talking things through with Peter for more instructions or specifics in his situation, and because of his general arrogance didn't stop the spell when Peter was backtracking.

It's that type of scene that shows how far the two still have to go.  Peter was able to get some development but Strange is going to have his hubris come to roost in his next movie.

And yes elektra is back. her story is pretty interesting as well (for a side character) She does take up the Daredevil mantle for a hot second too (you'll find out why in Zdarsky's run) and her suit looks pretty badass. 

Also a big reason why I recommend both runs is because Kingpin legitimately gets character development in his Mayoral arc to the point that some people may actually empathize with him.

Think he just threw in some insicors for his smile when he needed to get really big with it. So only real purpose behind then GG mask i can get behind is that it hid Norman's Identity.

The parallels of her death to other universes uncle Bens are apparent. The villain giving the killing blow was directly related to Peter's short-sightedness, and she literally gives the ""with great power"" speech before her death. Spiderverse especially has shown that not every spiderman literally has an Uncle Ben, but every spiderman does have a death that acts as that turning point for the character.

hp102g2,"Yes, they were brought because they knew who Peter Parker was, not because they wanted to kill Peter Parker, or because they knew Peter Parker was Spider-man. Electro knew Peter Parker but he didn't know he was Spider-man, he was still roped in. They only condition was knowing Peter Parker.",ri7eum

hpagow6,"I‚Äôve literally seen all of those films you recommended there and they aren‚Äôt that recent, have you not seen enough films from the last 2 years to recommend any lol? Superhero films make up such an incredibly small slice of the films I watch.

Tom Holland‚Äôs acting‚Äôs good, that doesn‚Äôt save a terribly written and set up scene, a scene this poor doesn‚Äôt define Spider-Man as well as
the fact the fails to take on board that lesson and attempts to murder the goblin, even after Mays awful speech, and the other Peters telling him the lesson so clearly. He doesn‚Äôt because he has to be physically stopped, it‚Äôs not defined yet, this is also shown by him making the wrong choice as Peter in Spider-Man 1, and refusing to respect MJ‚Äôs agency in choosing to be with him despite the fact he‚Äôs Spider-Man, and instead choosing to shoulder an unbearable burden alone. That may scene doesn‚Äôt define this Spider-Man.

The shot of Peter looking at the billboard is a well composed shot, but it‚Äôs ruined by the terrible and fake looking cgi being the entire shot. Stop being a Redditor for once and confusing your opinion as facts, this is obviously an opinion based discussion.",ri7eum
hqud9aw,"Dafoe is fantastic, and he pretty much saves the movie. Tom Holland and the peters, while their acting is fine, aren't putting up award winning performances. The choreography was pretty good, spiderman fights should be like that because he has unique mobility options.",ri7eum

My biggest fear is the next movie opening with Peter somehow getting into MIT.",ri7eum
hp9ucq3,"The main problem is that you are excusing issues because it's dumb fun, while also calling other movies out as being bad (""Lets not pretend TASM 1 is good"") and calling me out for watching it wrong, again against the idea that it's all subjective.",ri7eum
