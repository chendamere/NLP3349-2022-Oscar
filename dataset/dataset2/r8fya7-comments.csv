hn612bu,"I loved the tension between Peter and Phil in their last scene together. 

Peter’s character surprised me the most, and I didn’t think he could be that calculating.",r8fya7
hn7vd31,"I think the main problem is that the main theme in the book was discarded completely, namely that of parents who are not there at all for their children (both physically and mentally). 

The title of the book and the movie is one of the Psalms - the one that starts O father why hast thou forsaken me. This is also what Jesus said on the cross, when he doubted his father. I think it can be argued that a very big theme in the book is parents who are distant and not very good parents.

This explains why no one in the book/movie ever calls their parent ""mother"" or ""father"" - it's always ""the old man/lady"" or ""rose"". The book has lots of scenes about the parents of the different characters that have been omitted in the movie. 

And another thing. Phil's parents KNOW he is gay. They are ok with it as long as he lives far away from them with his dimwit brother who is ALSO a disgrace to the family. In the book there is a heart breaking scene where the parents console each other and assure themselves that ""it is not our fault"" (that Phil ended up as he did).

Taking out the bitter criticism of the parental generation and of parents who do not take responsibility for their kids leaves the story a little thin in my opinion.",r8fya7
hn8s0zq,The refreshing thing about this movie is that it’s a Western that doesn’t end with a shootout. It uses the Western setting perfectly without falling into the boring tropes of the genre.,r8fya7
hn86hxw,"Something I'm unsure about - Is cattle ranching a truly lucrative career? Or were the Burbank boys LARPING as cowboys because they come from old money and can do as they please? I figured it was the latter, which adds a layer of regressivessness to Phil, but I'm not so sure.",r8fya7

hniqty5,"The nesting birds in the tree was a very powerful scene. Peter not paying a single bit of attention to the ranch hands yelling profanities at him, and instead confidently walking over to the tree to observe the birds. Clearly a turning point in the movie in terms of how Phil views Peter. 

Phil sees in Peter something that he could never do, be confident and open with his sexuality. So Phil envied that aspect of Peter, and in turn invited Peter to learn from him. Albeit we quickly see Phil's true agenda is to strip away and remold Peter into something more reminiscent of himself. I'm assuming by doing this Phil could have another Bronco. If Phil is able to turn Peter into a cowboy, then they could go onto have a romantic relationship just like Phil and Bronco did.",r8fya7
hns1ojv,"I watched this movie last night and I have been getting sadder about it all day. So I read all 567 comments on this thread. Only a few mentioned having felt sad about the thing that absolutely seems to have gutted me. That is Phil's betrayal and murder, and this in spite of that fact that in terms of modern conventions of morality and sensibilities about bullying, racism, misogyny, and homophobia, Phil only really got what was coming to him. This also in spite of the fact that, like several other commenters, the atmosphere of dread and fear in the house because of Phil was immediately recognizable and viscerally real to me because my Dad was like that. Some people didn't understand Rose's paralysis in the face of it but I do. It's not the cruelty alone that breaks you down. It's your own powerlessness to confront it that does you in.

That said, the most powerful storylines in the world for me are the redemption ones. That's why I loved Bram Stoker's Dracula back in the day. Cumberbatch so remarkably portrayed a guy with a vast inner life that was utterly alone and which would be completely illegible to anyone in his universe that his viciousness reads as a snarling, biting rage and hate for a world that first hated him and that taught him to hate himself. He has only ever been loved once, and the memory of the power and wonder of it gives him what internal life he has.  So, in a way that this world's valorization of toxic masculinity has taught us, the audience, to admire as much is it informed Phil's brutal performance of what in fact was once the masculine ideal, he teaches all around him to fear him as totally unassailable. He pulls it off with a certain flair, maintaining a panache and keen and cruel wit that leads a certain kind of person to also admire him. And he surrounds himself with that kind of men. 

In order for this movie to work, you have to believe in the possibility of an inner life that is at once enormous and hidden. We see it in Phil's ""secret place,"" in which he enters his inner life and lets his inner self out into the light in the safety of solitude. There is a striking moment when Peter finds his way to the edge of the pond where Phil is bathing and Phil turns his head, sees the intruder, and instantly dons the mantle of a wolf, reflexively and almost animalistically driving the intruder away from his exposed and vulnerable self. 

Benedict Cumberbatch said of Phil's character that, if the movie had done its work, you came to understand that Phil wasn't a monster, and that to the extent we as a people can empathize with him we progress, and to the extent we only wish him harm we stagnate. I was glad I read that, because it validated my sense that this movie was and could only be understood as tragic if we had come to value Phil's life. 

The reason it gutted me was that Phil was tiptoeing toward finding connection with someone. He was finally starting to trust. That is such a terrifying place to be, we've all feared the horror of what it would mean to trust someone with some truth of ourselves and to be met with cruelty or ridicule or rejection. The shame, the embarrassment, the grief of it are among those things I think we fear more than anything else; certainly it was the thing Phil feared the most. And so here we have this guy who is godawful and vicious but whose feral self-defensiveness is protecting something pure against a world that is just as horrible to him as he is to it, who is finally taking small steps toward what could be redemptive. But he has trusted someone he probably felt safe around, based on the mistaken assumption that Peter was weak and therefor not a threat. And he is made a fool of in it; what he sees as tenderness is actually concealing the reality that what he thought was an emerging connection was false, and even through the last evening in the barn when the two were close and almost intimate, Peter is pretending all along as he methodically is carrying out Phil's murder. 

When I heard that final line, that it could have been anthrax, and George saying that Phil never handled sick animals, and my mind started going back over the events of the last half the movie, I at first shied away from the obvious conclusion. I mean, I read reviews before I watched the movie, I knew there was going to be something tragic, and I figured Phil was going to kill someone, or drive someone to suicide. But in spite of the fact I was waiting for tragedy, I was not prepared for Peter to have killed Phil. In the end, in spite of every sadistic, cruel thing he was, I mourned Phil.",r8fya7

hn7uvbj,"Hi all,

I just re-watched this movie again last night with my father, I haven't read the book, so please forgive my ignorance if this is mentioned in it. 

We were catching all the subtle hints sprinkled throughout the feature, but, one thing that really stood out to us, was the scene where Rose is asking Peter if there's if there's a sound that makes him shutter. To which he denies. But, then, you can see he begins to get teary eyed and begins to pluck the comb teeth again.

Now, I missed the similarity of the sound relation entirely. But my dad said, ""oohhhhhh, the comb sounds like a rope under tension!"" y'know.. Kinda like how Peter found his father? *creak* *creak*

And it all made a whole lot more sense, the animosity that was had towards Phil, once one redditor had revealed they'd left out the crucial information from the book, that he'd actually tormented the boys father, much like he does the everyone.

Great movie.",r8fya7
hn9vt6f,"Thoughts:

1. ""Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog"" = Deliver Peter from toxic masculinity; deliver Rose from alcoholism.   
I've seen people saying that the ""dog"" refers to Phil, but in this case I think it is a play on words. ""Hair of the dog"" (short for ""Hair of the dog that bit you"") refers to alcohol that is consumed with the purpose of curing a hangover. Peter wants to save his mother from alcoholism, and he needs to change Phil or get rid of him to do that.   

2. Peter's dad hung himself with a rope.   
Phil was making a rope for Peter; the rope was intended to help Peter metaphorically kill himself (personality-wise), to become a ""man"" in Phil's eyes.  
Peter keeps making the comb sound throughout the film, which as another redditor here pointed out, sounds like a creaking rope. The film makes you feel like Peter and Rose are slowly suffocating, like they are already hanging but not dead.   

3. Phil seems to starts to change in the end, but it is too little too late. He loses the hides (which he wanted to keep to make the rope, to form a bond with peter) because he has always burned them, and so people assumed he is just going to destroy and burn them.   
Phil metaphorically burns people, too. Even if he was truly planning on changing his behavior towards peter and his mother, it was already too late; he had already established his behavior and so people dont trust him.",r8fya7
hnan6d7,"Does anyone else think that Peter could have killed his father?  He tells Phil he found him and cut him down.  If he was drunk all the time could Peter have killed him?  He was the only witness to his death.  Play close attention to the beginning of the movie when Peter is narrator.  (“What kind of man would I be if I didn’t help my mother, if I didn’t save her?”  His father’s year of death was 1921 on the headstone, it’s now 1925.  How old would Peter have been 4 years ago?  Does Peter just remove anyone that harms his mother?",r8fya7
hn5h8ke,"One of my favorite little things about the movie I think is underrated is the sound. Hearing Phil's spurs ring even when he was nowhere near being on-screen really gave you a sense of him always being there, and really added to the aura of power he gives off.",r8fya7
hn7gk4f,I absolutely loved this movie. What a knockout of an ending.,r8fya7
hnjph2r,"Man I got this movie completely wrong. I thought it was a love story between Peter and Phil, in nowhere in my mind think Peter would actually kill him...

I thought Peter was coming to realization that he was different and gay and he saw Phil was experienced in the lifestyle he wanted. Like when Phil woke up that morning all sweaty I thought they fucked, not that he was dying. And when he died, I thought he died from aids from his previous lover. 

Man oh man did I get this movie wrong.",r8fya7
hn5vtzn,"What a great performance by Benedict Cumberbatch. Jonny Greenwood's score should be nominated.

I've always been impressed with Jane Campion's work. Her films are often haunting and erotic, with interesting characters and relationships.",r8fya7
hn67xoi,What's weird is I felt really bad for Phil by the end. He was finally beginning to open up and that was all taken away. I see it as a tragic series of events that leads to his death.,r8fya7
hn6q7z5,"Well I think this was a masterpiece. The acting, cinematography, score and direction were stellar and it made good use of the sound design to create this subtle but unrelenting tension. 

It was really compelling for me but I can see how one might find it boring. However,  I don't really understand the reactions in this thread calling it mediocre and lacking in nuance as well as character development. Nothing much happens plotwise but the build-up in tension is masterful and the film gradually reveals a lot about the characters whilst being quite subversive. Not really sure what else people want from it because this is far better than most films which are released. That's just me though. Not trying to invalidate other peoples' opinions.",r8fya7
hn6qjof,"I thought it was pretty good overall. It was an interesting story and the performances are all obviously really solid. The soundtrack was really fitting as well in giving off that uneasy, ominous atmosphere. By the end, the movie gave me vibes of a cross between There Will Be Blood and Brokeback Mountain. 

The only aspect that felt a little off (and it sounds like others feel the same way) and kept it from being a great movie in my mind, was in how most of the characters felt like they reacted to Phil in seemingly disproportionate ways. I know there was a lot of subtlety to his menace and the way he would torment the other characters, and maybe it's just a case of the movie being paced in a weird way, but it felt like his actions usually evoked a response that was simultaneously too passive and too overboard for the other characters. To be clear, I'm not saying ""Phil wasn't actually that bad"" or anything like that. The dude was a grade A asshole for sure. But maybe murdering him with anthrax was a little bit of overkill in terms of dealing with him. I just kept waiting for a moment where someone, anyone, would actually lash out or at least attempt to, and just raise the stakes a little bit. I mean, yeah, Rose sold off his pelts against his wishes, but that was after she'd already basically given up and resorted to alcohol to deal with her issues. I feel like it would have been more effective if she'd tried fruitlessly to confront Phil, only for her situation to not improve, and then start to break down from there. But for a large part of the movie, Phil is just a bully and everyone tiptoes around him rather than doing anything about it. I thought Peter's scheme in the back half of the movie was a good change of pace in that it felt like one of the characters was finally stepping up to do something, and the characters were finally starting to actually play off each other. The most interesting aspect of the movie was that sort of inverse dynamic of Peter ""seducing"" Phil with the ultimate intent to get revenge, especially when you consider how you know Phil probably thinks he's the one grooming Peter and getting one over on Rose, and I kind of wish more of the movie was centered around that dynamic. It was sort of like the predator doesn't realize he's actually the prey. But when it came to Rose and George, it seemed like they never reacted to Phil with any sense of agency, which wouldn't be a problem if Phil was portrayed as exerting genuine power over them, but it never felt to me like Phil was so overbearing and so overtly abusive as to actually restrict the other characters' agency. And if he was and it was just too subtle to pick up on it, then I still wish those characters would have put up some kind of resistance to it. I think I just found myself frustrated that Rose and George never actually confronted Phil in any meaningful way. It very much feels like a movie where the characters just don't quite feel connected to each other in a satisfying way, which is to say that the performances and writing of the characters are great on an individual basis, but they sort of feel incompatible together. To put it a different way, the individual parts were greater than the sum of those parts, in my opinion.",r8fya7
hn7ow49,"I was super excited to see this movie, and it left me lukewarm. I have no problem with de-construction, but this one just didn’t do it for me. It’s extremely well shot, Cumberbatch is really good, and the score is good, but otherwise I think it’ll be one of those movies that’s forgotten by next year. My favorite scene was when she’s practicing the piano and can’t get it right, and then Phil on the banjo joins in to mock her.",r8fya7

hnbzlbo,Can someone explain to me why Rose was unhappy when the governor and George’s parents visited? Why she refused to play the piano?,r8fya7
hnvk20a,"Does anyone else think that George's well-dressed behavior since the beginning of the movie might be a new habit?

That he is trying to change and is already going to Rose's house interested in her, hence the clothes.

That's why Phil teases him from the beginning, because he already knows.

The difference between Phil and George's clothes play a narrative role. And maybe his ""dressing better""\* is his attempt to be something other than a cowboy. Which also bothers Phil.",r8fya7
hnbi9xp,"I liked this movie while I watched it, but when it ended I was left with an empty feeling. Like I had certainly seen a well made film, but not one that left any sort of mark on me. 
Now that a little time has passed I'm beginning to think I may have left something after all, because I think about it and certain images or little moments pop into my head.",r8fya7
hqhga0v,"Film youtube has really broken some people's brains. Some of the intense speculation over ""theories""....some of y'all wildin. The film is completely transparent about the characters' actions and motivations and anything not explicitly laid out is probably besides the point.",r8fya7
hnrjiy4,"I was so confused by the marital bed scene at the beginning. I went in blind so this movie was a roller coaster of subverted expectations. 

Was the implication that the two brothers were platonic, just George was basically suffocated by Phil's abusive co-dependency and was conditioned to be incredibly submissive to Phil's whims? Only breaking away now from Phil's charismatic presence for the first time in 20+ years? 

I kept wondering if both George and Phil were in a physical relationship at some point but now George is shutting down and reaching out to Rose to escape the abuse from Phil. That didn't seem to be the case though and Phil's abuse towards humans was all mental, was Phil just broken without having that stranglehold George's life?",r8fya7
hp63709,"One of the things I appreciate about Jane Campion is the small details she uses as a woman director that most other directors wouldn’t bother with. For example, we’re meant to be skeptical of why Kirsten would quickly marry Jesse Plemons. Sure, he’s nice to her, but you don’t just marry someone because they were nice to you once when you’re crying. 

Campion’s choice to cast exclusively very attractive, younger, well-built cowhands, who are frequently shirtless and even nude, serves a purpose (beyond the film’s primary theme of repressed homosexuality). By contrast, Plemons is styled as more unattractive and older than he is — he looks like the Monopoly man, but Plemons is only 33 years old. He never shows a hint of charisma or wit, and is never shown in a sexual light, despite being the only male character to actually have sex during the story.

Why on earth would she immediately marry the only unattractive guy, when all these other men are around? Why would she marry him when they clearly have zero chemistry? She seems annoyed when he comes over (“I’m busy”), yet marries him that weekend. The scene in the field when he tells her she’s “amazing,” she looks uncertain, then he holds her thinking they’re having a romantic moment was hard to watch and indicative of their lack of chemistry. Cumberbatch sees it too, and correctly deducts that she married into their family for the money.

Of course, we naturally feel awful for Kirsten because the movie shifts towards Cumberbatch abusing her. But one of the brilliant things about campion’s movies is how no one is all good or all bad and how she shows the complexity of abuse. 

Cumberbatch is an asshole, but he was right that she was after their family money. Kirsten is a sympathetic victim of abuse and doesn’t deserve the hell he gives her, but who also chose to marry a man she didn’t love or desire. She knew she would have to leave her busy life at the restaurant for a boring life of being served by maids. After the movie ended, my partner and I wondered if she would have always turned to alcoholism, regardless of Cumberbatch’s abuse. Obviously he expedites it, but she was always going to be miserable living with Plemons. On the other hand, she does it all for her son so he can go to medical school.

The characters are rich and complex: victims are not completely noble; abusers are not completely evil.",r8fya7

hnamhix,"Book reader here. I'm a queer man so it may be surprising that Rose has always been the most fascinating character from the book from me, and holy molyyyyyyy Dunst is so so so bloody great.

The first time I watched this I was a tad disappointed. I felt like the following elements from the book weren't there:

1. Rose is working-class and this really *really* matters! That's the whole reason she gives the hides away: she's kind and feels terrible for the chief's son and little boy but because she has a certain working-class reverence & open-mindedness with Native Americans that rich ranchers like Phil & George wouldn't. The way the family shuns her at the dinner (she doesn't talk because everyone ignores her; it wasn't polite or appropriate for women of her station to speak before being spoken to) is already terrible & then when she chokes, Phil comes to twist in the knife
2. Rose knows her son better than it seems & her whole monologue BEGS for the moment for the audience to recognize that she sees Peter more clearly and is disturbed by him far more than it seems.
3. As she spirals, she becomes more and more childlike and nostalgic. She's paralyzed by fear, absolutely appalled by her own weakness & fairly embarrassed by it.

But honestly, on a second watch, I am stunned by Dunst's performance for somehow capturing ALL of this. The script contracts her and she packs it all in somehow, the layers are very much there. I wish the scene didn't cut away after she tells Peter not to be unreachable because she has a sharp reaction to his response. I wish the Native American scene was done justice because the intentionality of the scene came off differently, but I can't help but be stunned by Dunst. The whole cast is fantastic ofc: Plemons is exactly how I pictured George, Kodi exactly how I pictured Peter, Cumberbatch is fab even though I think they softened Phil down a bit too much. Still, Dunst is MVP for me.",r8fya7

hod50cp,"Great film. 

Was Phil the villian? I think he saw this gay kid and knew he would have to play the role of a straight man to survive in this world, so he was trying to teach him how to pretend the same way he has had to for years. But this kid was not going to live in the same world that Phil has.

Who would have been a better longterm mentor Phil or Rose? His protection and love for Rose seems toxic.

Did Peter purposely put himself in a position to be mocked by the other cowboys knowing Phil would see himself in the kid and would come to rescue him. And in turn allow him to get close enough to kill him?

Would the kid had actually gone through with the murder if Phil had not gone apeshit over the rawhide? He seemed conflicted.

Did the kid hang his Dad for getting drunk and beating a clearly fragile Rose?

Did Phil ever realize how he was played? At the end he still seems concerned for the Peter's wellbeing.",r8fya7

One thing that did stand out to me that I haven't seen mentioned yet is when Peter first shows up to the ranch, one of the first things he does is play with the dog. Phil, being who he is, whistles the dog away. 

In one of the last scenes, Peter is seen outside playing with the dog - not a care in the world. It gave me a chuckle.",r8fya7
hndlztt,"In relation to the opening and Peter I couldn’t stop thinking about the Psycho line, “a boys best friend is his mother”",r8fya7
ho4bx57,"To simply put, the movie centers around the construct of feminism and the definition of a man. 

It’s obvious Phil was suffering from some sort of identity crisis. He was at some point just like Peter, and his outward hatred towards Peter wasn’t due to plain homophobia but rather due to some sort identity crisis he developed from his previous relationship with Bronco. So seeing Peter sort of reignited the feminine personality he once had but because of his inferiority complex and to demonstrate his manliness, he chose to engage in a psychological warfare to re-exert (to prove) his manliness and establish male dominance.

His spite towards Rose was purely born out of the unwillingness to lose the precious attention he gets from his brother to Rose without putting up some fight.

However, the power dynamic took a different turn when Peter uncovered Phil’s secret erotic retreat. The understanding of whom Bronco was allowed Peter a glimpse of Phil’s psyche, Peter understood the frailty of Phil’s camouflaged manliness and merely capitalized on this to protect his mother (the very thing he said in the beginning).

The walk to the tree with the crowing birds amidst the cowboys was Peter’s first attack and it was purely to establish a false sense of bonding with Phil. The way I interpreted that scene is this - he wanted to intrigue Phil by a demonstration of manliness in Phil’s realm of understanding and thus create a suitable ground (opportunity) for Phil to intervene as a perfect mentor. He knew Phil won’t pass the opportunity to recreate the idea taught to him by Bronco.

Killing Phil was necessary, he had to because he wasn’t going to lose his mother. The opening of the film gave this away, but it is easy to miss because of the power dynamics and the erotic play that was starting to develop between Phil and Peter. 

An important scene in the movie is the scene with the rabbit where both Phil and Peter sat in the plains - Peter says his father had always worried he is not kind enough, that he is too strong and  Phil outrightly discards this because he won’t attribute that kind of “manly attribute” to Peter because of the effeminate way Peter portrays himself - it’s pretty obvious from this scene that the definition of manliness to Phil was the conventional idea of what a man is. He wouldn’t consider an effeminate peter (girl) strong because of the feminine characteristics he demonstrated. (This also was the construct at the time as defined by the society. Some elements of sexism here). In short the whole understanding of what defines a man is totally lost on Phil and Peter clearly understands this and took this as the weakness to take hm down.

What I like about the movie - It explored the subtlety and nuances of the human sexual psyche, the societal constructs of sex and explored the impact of wrongful teachings. Phil’s understanding of sex versus identity was wrong, and that was due to the faulty relationship he had with Bronco.

What I didn’t like - The movie gave the ending away too easily. The transition wasn’t all smooth, scenes were cut abruptly, which I think are unnecessary, probably are to obscure the readers from easily establishing links. I would have loved to see a breakdown of Phil’s projected “manly” psyche as the ending. Also, there is a subtle thing with between Peter and Rose, not erotic, which the movie didn’t really explore but we can see evidence at the scene where the mother literally broke down trying to create a conversation between them, plus what he mentioned at start of the movie that he needed to protect his mother. This is something in the line of a God complex. So I would have really loved if Phil wasn’t killed by Peter because to me it merely confounded Peter’s (men) idealism as his mother’s (women) savior. I would say Peter was so keen on protecting Rose, not just because she was his mother, but because he is taking on the responsibility of what used to be his father’s which he understood as a role for a man. 

Overall the movie is pretty good, I would rate it 6.5 - 7. This is merely my subjective opinion. Sorry about the grammar, not a native English speaker.

hn5jrz2,"I really liked this movie. It was beautifully shot and the sound was great. Acting was great all around IMO. They really wanted to make sure the viewer knew Phil was gay, I didn’t have a problem with them making it so obvious in the later parts of the movie.

hndyx2w,"Wow.

Preface: I (gay man, 38) watched this film without hearing anything about it and have never read the book, didn't know it had gay content, I just liked the dreary dustbowl preview image.

It blew me away!  The absolute rage that Phil carries fills every room with tension and then leaves a vacuum of anxiety in his absence, was so fucking well done in this film.  It was 100% my dead bigoted grandfather and the existence I had growing up.    I had an exceptionally difficult time watching this, it was gut wrenching for me.

I have never understood trigger warnings before, until I watched this film.  I was so triggered until the half-way point when Phil makes nice with Peter and acknowledges him publicly in front of the people who are calling slurs at him. I was sweating and had shortness of breath I was so afraid the first half of the movie.   Peter was such a vision of STRENGTH in that scene, it totally broke me to watch him hold his head high and be 100% true to himself despite everything people were doing to him and throwing at him socially. It was so much like my days in high school walking down the hall and people yelling shit at me or other gays.

This is the best film I have seen in years.   Because I knew nothing going in, I legitimately thought they were going to fall in love - the scene were Peter discovers the (gay) physique magazines shocked me to realize that Phil was gay and then it seemed they were falling for each other right until the end.

I LOVED the plot twist ending, but smelled it a mile away when they showed the dead cow, it was clear to me that it died of anthrax and that Peter was up to no good, and then when they showed Phil's hand in the water, it was obvious to me what Peter did.  (I read the early rabbit scene as a pointer towards a serial killer, because most serial killers kill and dissect small animals in their youth ...kind of wondered if Peter killed his dad too in order to ease the suffering for his mom...)

Thanks for the great discussion!  Really great to read this thread and see other takes and insight, I really appreciate that.  So interesting all the different lenses and perspectives people have discussed.

hn887qv,"Maybe I missed the explanation for these in the movie, but here are some questions.

Why did Phil hate Rose so much initially? Did he know her from before? Or was it because Peter was her son and Phil was homophobic?

Did Rose just feel inadequate playing the piano compared to Phil on the banjo. Is that why she didn't play during the dinner? Or was there something else? I feel like she still could've played something successfully  that would've satisfied everyone that was there.

Near the end when Rose gave the pelts away, was it just to piss off Phil because he was tormenting her, or because she deeply cared about the indigenous?",r8fya7

manipulative, 
lack of emotion, 
childhood trauma etc",r8fya7
hn5ikrg,"Very good film. I think the early reviews kind of set a high bar for me going in, but it looks beautiful and Cumberbatch & Smit-McPhee are standouts. I know early buzz had Dunst as a potential Best Actress lock but I *reallllllllllly* don’t see it. 

For a film that was frequently very atmospheric and asking the audience to infer things, it also had moments where it just really beat you over the head. Watched it at home, but wish I saw it in theaters. I think I would have felt the tension even more than I did.",r8fya7
hr8cdwt,"IIRC, in the book, it's said the father committed suicide due to bullying by Phil and his crowd. 

As for 'Peter is a psychopath' because he: put an animal down and dissected it? Not evidence he's a serial killer in the making. 

My dad grew up on a cattle ranch in the 1930's. Animals were put down if they were injured, slaughtered for food, or killed to protect the others. Hen didn't lay? Chicken for dinner. Heck, dad and his family kept rabbits for food. 

I was briefly a pre-nursing student. Animals were dissected.",r8fya7
hn5vvrf,"Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons really got out of their comfort zone to play a married couple.

I almost wish the line where Peter says, “My father thought I was too strong” was removed. Was too overt for a nuanced script and makes it too clear where the film is heading.

Was Thomasin McKenzie putting on a false voice during her small part?

Overall thought it was a solid film, but one that almost seems to beg to be revisited in order for the whole package to sink through. The problem is that I don’t know if I loved this enough to give it another watch.",r8fya7

hqnph19,"From what I am reading, the book elaborates on the problems I had with the movie.  I felt no connection to anyone but Phil.  The kid was too damn creepy and serial killery, I didn’t see him as someone protecting his mom. Kid killed a rabbit lol.  

Kirsten dunsts was just there and Fat Damon didn’t do much either.  There feels like an arc with him in the beginning when he cries and it just dissipates.  

And Phil maybe came off annoying but he never seemed that brutal nor did I feel Kirsten wasn’t in danger.  It seemed like he just didn’t like her and gave angry glances.  I guess he sucks because he beats horses and calls his brother fatso but I felt a lot for him cause he felt lonely and it seemed like he lost his lover (and maybe was groomed) and Kodi reminded me of him.

Even then in the end, it felt like Phil was changing and becoming a better man.  Murdering him felt cold and gross.  I hated Peter more and I don’t think that was the movie’s intent? 

It seems like the book was more jn depth on that while the movie is all surface level.  As bad as Benedicts accent was, he was really magnificent to watch. 

I think this my problem with Jane Campion, I hated The Piano (I found the love story to be total bullshit and it to be very rapey, as in Harvey Keitel is disgusting and it makes no sense for her to even love him becsuse he a sad boy? Plus everyone but little Rogue sucked as a person in that movie.) and here the characters and themes felt hollow.",r8fya7

Thought the film was great in that it didn't lay everything out in front of you, but actually gave you things to think about afterwords.  And there were no super heroes or explosions.

Spoilers below:

hs6frbp,"I can recognize this as a great film, but there are a few things that don't sit right with me. I guess I wanted it to be more of a redemption story than a revenge story. Just when Phil is on the verge of changing and opening up to Peter and taking him under his wing (as Bronco Henry had done for him), Peter comes off as very cruel and vindictive in the final hour. That whole ""seduction"" scene, which is actually Peter witnessing Phil's demise, seems quietly evil. When Phil, delirious from anthrax, looks to find Peter to give him the finished rope he had stayed up all night working on, it just feels so sad. Are we supposed to be rooting for Peter here?",r8fya7
hpht00y,"The ending is even more complex and sinister than one might realize.  Peter of course finds way to get rid of Phil in the end, but his earlier actions beg the question, has he killed before?  Early on, Peter states it’s his duty as a son to protect his mother, this comment seems well thought out.  A few examples of the duplicity of the act that follow. 

In the first rabbit scene, Peter surprises us by killing what we believe is a beloved pet in the name of science. While out riding fence with Phil, we get a (second!)  rabbit death, this one a mercy killing.  Immediately afterwards,  Phil berates Peter’s mom for being an alcoholic, to which Peter replies “she never used to drink”. Peter goes on to tells Phil that father was an alcoholic and died from suicide by hanging-from a rope. Peter tells Phil that he found his father and cut him down, implying an act of mercy.  Peter tells Phil his father worried he wasn’t kind enough, was too strong.  To this Phil replies “he got that all wrong”.  Maybe Phil has it all wrong?  We get an ominous glance from Peter. One can imagine a backstory between Peter and his father, an alcoholic surely unkind to Peter’s mother.  Peter shows no loss for his dad.

Soon thereafter, Peter finds an opening to kill Phil with the diseased hide, and solves a problem for his mother.   Again with a rope.  The manner in which he lures in Phil is so premeditative as to suggest this isn’t his first rodeo.  

We next find Peter reading a Psalm, one he immediately locates in his bible as though he’s read it before. Peter certainly delivered his “soul from the sword” and his darling (mother) “from the power of the dog”.   Again.  

Finally, Peter is seen caressing the rope.  He carefully places it under the bed as though he may need it yet again another day. As George kisses his mother, he smiles believing that he may in fact be delivered from the sword.",r8fya7
hpx2axk,"Just finished watching. Really great acting, especially Cumberbatch, who I was sorry for at times despite being an aweful person. Film divided into chapters, allowing for speedy progression. Thats why Rose can take her first drink in a scenw, and then be an alcoholic in practically the next. For me there were no surprises. Peter slaugtered the first rabbit for ""science"" without emotion,,  show a very dark side to come. Phil was not able to express his sexuality
but surrounded himself by men. He even shared a bed with his brother...and when Rose came along, it threatened his house of cards. He couldnt cope with hearing their lovemaking...it brought things to the surface. His rejection pof Peter was a rejection of his own sexuality. The pond, accessed by a secret entrance, was his own secret world of sensuality (mud bath) and porn, not to be shared with anyone. Peter's discovery thereof meant Phil had to tie himself (the rope???) to Peter as they now shared a secret. The oles had changes and Phil had become the teacher, where he had been the 'pupil' to Bronco. His obvious distance from his parents  and 'oneness suggest that the encounter with Bronco many years earlier, had been his only ever closeness with anyone, relived over and over at the pond. Phil never showed any interest in the 'hottie bare chested cowboys ' in the movie, although the naked cowboys froliking in the river had strong homo erotic overtones.  He was obviously haunted by his sexuality, one of the reasons he rarely bathed and was smelly....to keep people at bay. Oh boy...so much in this movie, would love to spend a day with Jane Campion talking about it.Brilliant film.",r8fya7

hogt4d5,"I just watched this, and one thought I had was whether Pete also killed his father. At the dining house, Rose is clearly bothered by the drunken revelers. We learn her late husband was an alcoholic, and clearly from the first voice over to the ending, we know Pete sees himself as his mother’s protector. Pete “found” his father’s body, and is clearly able to play the long game. I haven’t seen any other discussions online about this, so maybe it’s just me.",r8fya7

hn6oysi,"I know this will be an unpopular opinion here, because reddit eats up slooooow films with grating scores and try-hard cinematography, but man was that an awful film. No redeeming qualities. I paused it to check how much time was left several times, waiting for the point of it all. I'm genuinely upset I wasted my time watching it. The ending was not nearly worth the chore of sitting through that. Ugh. And the score... I had to mute it a few times. I don't even know if grating describes it properly, it gave me a headache by the end of it. I've never walked out of a movie theater, but I absolutely would have walked out on this one if it were in theaters. 


The main characters weren't believable- Cumberbatch was a caricature, I was cringing at how painfully written his dialogue was, especially the first half of the movie. Then he just took a completely unexplained, out of character pivot and turned into a soft weirdo. Kirsten Dunst just turned into an emotionless lump on a log. ""Ooh, look how pained my facial expression is. I'll keep it like this for two hours"". Plemons played the same character he always plays. The kid was fine, he gave off serious serial killer vibes the second he appeared on screen.


Now everyone can chime in and tell me to stick to Michael Bay films, har har har. This film is plain old boring Oscar-bait for wannabe film critics to pleasure themselves to with their pinkies up.

hnfs8nc,"I thought the movie was awesome. I actually liked Phil's character a lot but didn't really like how he was portrayed as the 'villain' and thusly responsible for Rose's mental state. I mean yes, he was a complete asshole at times and could have been more welcoming. However, it seemed a healthy well-intentioned skepticism toward Rose for his own brother's well-being.  He was a hard man that lived a hard daily lifestyle and that was his home. He's doing the majority of the work and suddenly your slacker brother(I'm sure George is integrally important though and handles logistics) brings home a wife without even talking to you about it. I can just imagine the array of emotions he'd feel. Betrayal, jealousy, loss, frustration, anger, fear. All of this seems compounded by the lack of communication between everyone. I can sympathize with Rose though, speaking up and frankly, just being a woman in those times seemed like a hardy endeavor. Funny how I thought how so much could have been avoided if George would have built a separate house for just him and Rose. I can understand why Peter did what he did, but I thought to myself after the movie ended like there goes your ranch. You killed your best worker and leader of the men that actually produced value. Now George is going to have to step it up. People like Phil are the byproduct of getting down into the filth and trenches every day, and literally grappling with mother nature and the elements to bring about the raw resources needed for society to keep churning toward progress. We need people like that, they're the very foundation of civilization itself. Overall, Phil was a necessary 'evil'. RIP Phil.",r8fya7
hnqrbuy,"The vibe of the film reminded me a little of *There Will Be Blood*, especially with the choice of music. After watching it I read up on it more and found out that Paul Dano was originally supposed to act in it. So the director definitely was influenced by TWBB. 

I enjoyed it. It was a character study, not an action or thriller. It was focused on people’s motives and desires and their individual turmoil they wrestle with inside themselves.  I wouldn’t recommend it to someone who gets bored easily or who can’t find depth in something besides a standard cookie cutter movie.",r8fya7
hoh2zww,"That was one of the most intense cinematic experiences that I have had in a while. I truly love this film, which is surprising considering I have a lot to critique.

I have a sneaking suspicion I only liked it as much as I did because I had the book to back it up. I watched the film with a few others who had not read the book and was really itching to explain a lot when they were confused--which I don't blame them for being.

Campion did such an incredible job with the relationship between Peter/Phil and Phil/Bronco Henry, so I am unsure as to why she seemed to drop the ball with Rose and Peter's backstory (I wouldn't have minded a flashback scene or two), Rose's downfall (Why aren't there more silent torture scenes with Phil?), and Peter's ultimate motive for killing Phil (would liked to have seen more of Peter observing the interactions between Phil and his mother), and the gloves. The goddamn lack of gloves on Phil's hands!!

Thomas Savage mentions Phil's insistence on not wearing gloves at least a dozen times in the book, and the irony of his pride in this piece of his masculinity ultimately resulting in his death is completely lost on the film audience. It would not have been hard to add in a short conversation between Phil and George after Phil is cut after castrating (""You know, you should wear gloves when you're doing that."" / ""Gloves are for sissies."" etc).

Also, some of the editing was odd. Several weird cuts and seemingly shortened scenes, perhaps for the sake of run-time. Would love to see a directors cut.

But holy God, do I still love this movie. Phil laying in the sun with Bronco Henry's ?handkerchief? was the most oddly beautiful scene ever. New Zealand makes the perfect Montana. The questionable homoeroticism was tantalizing. The building of tension was so well done. Score was brilliant. And the *smile* on Peter's face when he's sharing the cigarette with Phil--an incredible way to tell the audience how he knows the dynamic has changed between them.  

I guess I just question why some scenes followed the book line-by-line while others were completely forgotten. That isn't to say I disapprove of every change made; I think the film actually improves a lot of areas of the book--namely Phil's and Peter's relationship and Phil's emotional complexities.

One question. This applies to both the book and the movie: does anyone else wonder if it is left purposefully ambiguous as to whether or not Phil and Peter actually reached a sexual point in their relationship? And if so, do you think they did?

A lot of thoughts. I think I'm done now.",r8fya7
hre4n80,"Aside from the main leads being fantastic (which they were of course) i thought Dunst was *outstanding* in this. Having dealt with alcoholism in the family before, that scene with her talking about her school teacher was legit triggering because of how true her performance was.",r8fya7
hwtd6la,"Finally watched this because of all of the oscar nominations. 

Wow, I dont understand the hype, I thought this was a very average movie. The acting is truly phenomenal, that much is true, but the story is pretty bland with no actual tension or genuine emotional hooks. Benedict deserves the nom and Kirsten and Jesse were pretty good too, but played very 1-dimensional characters. 

The movie is so boring throughout, with no real tension or character development except for Phil. The first 1.5 hours is where you'd expect the characters to be built up, so that the final scenes actually have impact but that doesnt really seem to be the case. So many scenes just further in-grain the personalities that we know the characters have. The climax isnt nearly as subtle as people make it out to be and I'm struggling to see how people missed it to be honest. All the characters are so robotic and trope driven that we'd hope that when Phil starts to open up that some of the other characters would too... but no, the emotionless boy is a cunning killer. (or is that subversion supposed to be good?)

Cinematography and Soundtrack are good but its one of those ones where it makes such a big deal about the landscape that of course its going to be good. Its a beautiful landscape, you'd hope the cinematography took advantage of it. 

Comes across as a movie where its presented as artsy in a way that you have to say you 'get it' to not be left out.",r8fya7

The big 4 actors did a great job of not overdoing their roles, like they are truly lived-in characters.

It wasn't until I saw this the second time that I realized Peter set a rabbit trap in the field in order to lure a rabbit in order to lure Phil. What are percentages Peter would catch a rabbit that survived with a broken leg?  What are percentages Phil would injure his hand facilitating Peter's plan?  The next one was when Phil and Peter were in the barn.  Peter goes to the saddle and caresses it the same way Phil did.  It seemed scenes were wrapped too perfect to be believable.   I might be reading too much into this scene.  It was when Phil came downstairs to go to the doctor.  He was cleaned and dressed like he was going to a funeral.

hy01ti8,"I fully agree that Bronco was an abuser, and was probably abused himself. 

both brothers are grooming/abuse stories. george represents repression and rejection, and phil represents obsession and perpetuation. It’s the source of their interpersonal tension. 

George always wanted to forget the whole thing and carry on. Phil on the other hand wants to obsess and reminisce about his abuser (who died enshrined in the divine idealisation of young phil’s mind), and resents George for this. The saddest part of this is that, somewhere inside, the compulsion Phil has to connect with his brother is coming from a place of shared trauma - what he truly needs is an objective person  to re-establish the objective truth of what happened to him, and George (who has no capacity to talk about it) is his only shot at that. It’s terribly fucking tragic.

I cannot lie, I have never been a huge Cumberbatch fan in my life, but my word, he was outstanding in this movie. Chilling in scenes.

hnfmcdr,"God I hated this movie. It's so bad. It's so, so bad. I do NOT understand how so many people like it. I have never come to the internet to talk about how bad a movie was before but upon reading how much praise it received I had to write it all down because no one else has and frankly I am befuddled 

1) Benedict Cumberbatch's terrible American accent.
A. It always sounds terribly forced
B. It isn't consistent: He says Georgie like a Bostonian ""jaah jee"" then says ""George"" ""jor j"" completely normal later. In the scene when he yells he completely loses his vowels, they sound bostonian ish again but overall he has no recognizable accent, just sounds weird af
C. He puts too much ""low"" in words like ""pillow"" 
D. He puts too much ""ing"" in words that end in ing
E. What made his terrible accent even WORSE is that the dialogue included grammatical structures or vocabulary that would hint at him having a more rural or slightly Southern-leaning dialect (such as personal datives) 
Don't agree? Watch 1:42:30 - 1:43:30, with the especially cringey ""bloody tootin"" alongside a rather Scottish-sounding pronunciation of ""alcoholic personality""

2) Benedict Cumberbatch's acting is flat & uninspired. Reminds me of Keanu Reeves. Must be because he was thinking too hard about his accent 

3) Jesse Plemons is the same character he was in Breaking Bad. Same voice/accent same demeanor, just different clothes and a mustache. YAWN. 

4) What filmmaker would allow such terribly historically & regionally inaccurate voices to exist in their film??

5) The banjo is used by a threatening character to create a threatening musical motif. HOW UNORIGINAL. Deliverance did it better and frankly I don't think any of us needed the reference again because in that movie it was actually terrifying

6) Cumberbatch's character wasn't actually that mean. He was a bully, yes, but nothing that happened here was scary or even emotionally threatening. He was a bully, that's it, and in his time he would not have even been considered much of that. I have known many, many more sinister characters in my everyday life, from childhood to the present, and I am *genuinely* confused as to why this guy is supposed to be so threatening.

7) While I understood that there was the homosexual undertone and I understood that the anthrax was intentional by Peter, there are MANY people who wouldn't due to not understanding medical science well enough to figure out that the rawhide would have transmitted anthrax via the hand cut. Frankly to leave things so ""suggestive"" as I saw a reviewer call it, is simply being pretentious. A great film does not have to be difficult to understand for those who don't have a certain level of knowledge, and creating it that way is just being pretentious.

8) Why does it have to be SO DAMN LONG for so LITTLE to happen/ be said?? For over 2 hours, you better be bringing me Reqiuem of a Dream-type brilliance. 

9) The overdramatic piano to cover up the lack of actual dialogue or acting to evoke true emotions. I was so sick of that stupid piano by the end of it. 

Here's my summary of the movie I saw: 
Two brothers came from money, one is the rebel / black sheep & closeted gay, who overcompensates by being a tough jackass. Other goes along with whatever his brother wants because he's passive. Passive guy finds an even more passive woman to marry. Her kid is gay. Gay kid & his mom are bullied by jackass dude & his crew because toxic masculinity & homophobia & misogyny & he's unhappy himself so everyone else should be too. His mom drinks instead of ever saying or doing anything. Boy found his father dead, so his trauma background resulted in macabre interests of killing and dissecting animals (and this is supposed to be seen as abnormal, not just because he wants to learn anatomy for being a Dr). When the closeted gay asshole tries to form a relationship with the teen similar to the only great relationshop he had (which is assumed to be a friendship that was also a homosexual relationship) the kid purposefully infects him with anthrax, because guess what? He's angry too.

If you want to watch a vastly better film, I recommend Brokeback Mountain or American Beauty.",r8fya7
hn66rn7,"I'm split on this movie. It's gorgeously shot, and probably the best acting I've seen from Benedict Cumberbatch. I'm glad I went into it without knowing much about the plot, and despite it being over 2 hours long, I never found it boring. I remember looking at the time and being shocked that there was only 10 minutes left.

It's definitely a movie that has me thinking a lot about it, and what exactly the main message all was. There isn't necessarily a big climax where all the tension that's grown between Rose, Phil and Peter comes to a head. When the scene cut to Phil suddenly being dead, I was like ""wait, what????"" and thought I missed something.

I'm seeing a lot of people say the movie is about ""masculinity"" with a lot of subtext about being gay in the 1920s. I see it more as a look at a time that's often romanticized/dramatized in the media, and instead focusing on the sad, lonely realism of it, as well as the roles and acts we put on to survive in such a harsh environment. 

Obviously Phil was a man who was sexually assaulted and groomed as a kid, and starts going down the same path as ""Bronco Henry"", playing the macho, mean cowboy who takes a kid under his wing for darker purposes. But in a way he's doing it out of his own enjoyment, and also to fuck with Rose. We're at first led to believe that Peter is a naive, weak boy who seems to be an easy victim for Phil, but with hints through the movie (him being able to easily kill and dissect that rabbit, his interest in cows and anthrax, possibly being disturbed by finding his dead father), it's revealed to be a bit of an act as he's much more calculating and cold than expected. Rose struggled in the desert, unable to stand up to her brother-in-law, was an anxious mess around her husband's parents, and became an alcoholic. Peter meanwhile adapts to his surroundings, and finds a calculated way of getting rid of the man who's making him and his mom's life difficult. 

Anyway, it's definitely am interesting film that prompts a lot of discussion. I would've maybe liked some more dialogue that helped drive some of the points home. Cumberbatch and Kodi Smit-McPhee definitely deserve nominations.",r8fya7
hn68i8x,"Liked it but didn't really understand Dunst's character. Cumberbatch was abusive at first leading to her drinking problem, but he did start to show his more earnest side, to her son anyway, but she does nothing to help herself in the situation.

I really liked the twist with Phil's sexuality and him developing a relationship with Peter, but I was hoping for more of a plot than was delivered.

The movie sort of just meanders to a close after flirting with conflict for a couple hours. I was also not a fan of the dialogue which was super stiff, I know that's the vibe they were going for but it felt so unnatural. Almost like watching a play vs a movie.",r8fya7

hod0imh,"I don't understand what Peter did to evoke the change in Phil's attitude towards him.
Clearly Peter had a long plan to get rid of Phil and the scene where he was reading the medical book and found the solution which is followed by him going out and finding the dead beast and having his gloves and knives ready.  I'm a horse rider and that ride to find the beast and go down the loose shale would take a lot of courage.   Peter was on a mission there 
I wondered if more happened in the scene where Peter found Phil bathing and the pretty awesome view of naked Cumberbatch chasing him.
I just don't understand why Phil changed so quickly immediately after that.  How did Peter orchestrate that change in Phil?
Might need to read the book",r8fya7
hp14htl,"Just watched it yesterday, and one thing bothered me, and I wonder if anyone else noticed, and that's the pacing & editing felt kind of .. odd?

Like I was ready for this to be a slow and sombre style of film, but then it kind of jumped between scenes, and between time and place kind of abruptly in many places.",r8fya7
hp9ir9t,"Here's another possible theory - Peter is the son of Bronco Henry & Rose, in BH's attempt to hide his homosexuality and live a 'normal' life.  Would explain why he ultimately killed himself. Phil is essentially the jilted lover, which explains the very intense anger he displays towards Rose from the start and throughout.  This relationship felt very personal to me, so much that there had to be some back story there... and think it's because they shared that love for Bronco (whom I think was quite possibly an  Indian man).   I observed keen parallels between the way Phil handled all of Bronco's possessions, and the way that Rose handled  the gloves that were given to her from the Indian traders. Peter had an infinity to making flowers, passed down to him from his father. The gloves that were given the Rose had beautiful flowers on them. Would also explain why she was so willing to give the traders the hides.

Phil is always referring to all the ways in which Bronco influenced his life -

1.the way he 'saw things in the land' that others did not,

2.the Native imagery surrounding his possessions (like the blanket on his bed),

3. When Phil 'washed' himself with mud, this to me resembled  a smudge ceremony.

4. Rolling tobacco is considered a respect gift to give to Indian people.

Phil is always referring to how Peter reminds him of Bronco Henry.

One flaw in this theory however, is the fact that Peter's father was a doctor named John Gordon. Perhaps this is all more symbolic  thinking than anything else, but the intense hatred that Phil has for Rose, has yet to be explained.

hqwu28h,"Just finished this film and I was enthralled the whole way through. First thought it was another western which greatly intrigued me then it became something more. The way Phil makes Rose seem so small by comparison, her lack of talent at music, and how he can just crush her by playing his banjo upstairs. He kills her spirit little by little. His obsession with Bronco Henry showed how groomed he had become and was ready to do it to someone else. I loved the expression on Phils face when Peter broke the rabbits neck. As if he didn't even expect this ""Nancy"" to actually do it. I expected Phil to die but not the way he did. It was brilliant. Yes, it was murder but the simple fact that Peter did what every neglected, ""different"" child dreams they could do: save their parents. He saved his mother from hell. Gave her and George a happy ending.",r8fya7
hr1ew88,Now I keep wondering if Rose knew 🤔,r8fya7
hr6w01j,"I somehow guessed Phil was gay immediately based on his reaction to Peter. The way Peter presented himself really bothered Phil and I suspected he was so mean because he couldn't accept that part of himself. But I was still surprised when it got really obvious and I was actually right. I felt like I kept guessing what would happen next and it actually would but then the ending came and I didn't see it coming. I really thought that Peter did it by accident until I saw him holding the rope at the end while wearing gloves himself and then removing them once he's done with the rope. 

  
I feel annoyed with myself that I should have known all of this, because I knew Peter was brilliant when I saw him dissecting the rabbit. I was also kind of wondering why he didn't offer to help out with the wound- sew it up or something.   


I remembered he said something needed to be done about his mother and then in the next scene was out cutting up a diseased cow. I thought he was going to use a cow organ to perform a minor surgery  or create a medicine which would cure his mother of a brain tumour or some issue he was brilliant enough to diagnose. I was convinced the mother had a brain tumour which was causing her migraines and causing her to act recklessly (with the drinking). But Phil was reason enough to drink as well.",r8fya7
hr96c0e,"I felt, to the very end, that Phil's intention towards Peter was to harm him in order to hurt Rose.  That he was pretending to be nice so that Peter would trust him, then he would hurt him.

hup51fg,"I thought it was interesting that Phil referred to his mom as The Old Lady. That wouldn’t be that significant on it’s own, but I wonder if it was added in to show his hatred of women in general. Calling his mom an insulting name and demeaning Rose are both ways of keeping power from these women in his life who otherwise hold some status. 
Also, I didn’t see any discussion about the jewelry that the mom gave to Rose at the end. Anyone know what that’s about?",r8fya7
hw4os53,"The chapter with the pet rabbit was a great foreshadow of the end of the movie.

As soon as the cute bunny shows up, I was dreading the moment that Phil would kill that rabbit in some cruel way. And when we learn that Peter killed it for his medical studies, and we don't even really see the death, it's so unexpected

Then that dynamic plays out again at the end of the movie. I'm waiting the whole time for Phil to do something cruel to Peter, and in a flash, we realize that it's Peter who killed Phil, and again without us even really seeing the death.

Great movie!",r8fya7

And following on from that, anyone else think that when Peter goes to the bird's nest, it's to see if any chicks have fallen out? He even looks at the ground beneath the tree then turns and walks away.

Just finished the movie, I feel like the twist didn't have as big an impact because I worked out the connection between anthrax hide and rope as soon as he started cutting up the dead cow; the blood in the water moment confirmed this, which is when I really had the ""Oh no, anthrax rope!"" aha moment, so by the ending it wasn't new information for me. Feel like this took a lot of impact away.

hneiukr,"I went into this movie not knowing really anything about it other than it looked like a western. I had heard the name Jane Campion, but I had to look her up later to find out what else she had made.  
  
This isn't your typical western, filled with tough, gritty, and complex characters - the kind of grit you would need to survive out in the unforgiving western frontier. This film is instead filled with a bunch of one-dimensional, passive aggressive characters that don't seem like they could much survive any real kind of hardship. Maybe this film is about those that can't survive. Okay, fine then.  
  
Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) is the only character with a discernable personality and anything you could actually call character development, and even he goes from the two extremes of being a brooding dick to being a brooding and empathetic character towards Pete (Kodi Smit-McPhee). Even this small amount of character development is so thin and unexplained that we don't even get a real sense of why Phil changes all of a sudden.  
  
The rest of the characters in this film are some of the most passive characters I've even seen in a movie hyped by the critics to these proportions. They have no semblance of character development or complex personalities. They basically are just hanging around waiting for the plot to happen.  
  
Take George (Jessie Plemmons). Do we ever find out anything about his personality or character motivations other than he wants to get married? Why does he just sit around and let his brother be a complete dick to his wife? Why does he never seem the least bit conflicted or bothered by the fact that his wife is drinking herself into an early grave? Why does he have no interaction with his step-son? No clue. Plemmons plays him with a certain stoic seriousness, and the movie treats him with a sort of gravity like he is some character that should be respectable, but I just ended up despising him for having no sort of agency of his own.  
  
Next take Rose (Kirstin Dunst). Her only defining character trait is that she is a drunk. How is it that a woman who has been able to survive in a rugged place like this as a single mother is completely undone by someone making fun of her playing the piano? That is a brittle-ass spirit, to borrow a phrase from someone else. And does she even care about her son? She doesn't have any meaningful interaction with him beyond the first time we meet the two characters. This character would have been much better served with some actual personality and character development - some actual agency in trying to survive in a place like this other than screaming at her son a couple of times to stay away from Phil like an idiot.  
  
Pete, I guess you could say is the second most interesting character, but that's not saying a lot. His character doesn't really say much or interact with the other characters with any sort of agency. He just seems to be along for the ride until - surprise! We find out at the end that he was really a clever calculating murderer the whole time. This whole plot point is one of the most contrived things I've seen in a long while. Because the whole film is trying to be too clever with it, there is no real build up and no payoff. Blink at the end and you'll completely miss Pete smiling and will be confused if it was even meant to be intentional or not.  
  
Then you have all of the ranch hands. A better film would have found small scenes to at least give a few of them individual personalities. But they only seem to be hanging around to embody ""toxic masculinity"". Good job, writers.  
  
So what does the movie have going for it? The cinematography is pretty good even if New Zealand looks nothing like Montana. I had to look up where it was later as I simply couldn't place it based on the geography. Benedict Cumberbatch does his best to imbue the film with some sort of personality even though at the end I couldn't help but feel that the whole thing was a waste of acting talent.  
  
I'm honestly baffled why this film is being talked about as possibly a best picture candidate. I think too many of the reviewers were fooled by the artsy nature of the film and ignored its many shortcomings. Perhaps I need to watch some more things by Jane Campion to find out why reviewers are calling her one of the best directors of her generation because I just don't get it by watching this film. The Piano was pretty good, even though it was a long time ago. And I actually think the dark brooding atmosphere worked well in Top of the Lake, which took its time to develop characters and personalities, even though the ending was equally contrived and seemed to come out of nowhere.  
  
Anyway. That's my review. Thanks for reading.",r8fya7

hnach91,I know I’m in the minority here but I found this movie painfully boring. It had good acting and some good moments of tension but that’s it for me. I was bored out of my mind.,r8fya7
hn5yu8m,"So... my take on this one is that it was ""ok,"" with strong performances, but kind of boring.

I thought I was going to get a ""western"" film. I guess I was coming off the high of watching *Old Henry* and I was hoping for a more dramatic character driven western story this time around, than the suspense/action that Old Henry was, even though it was great film. 

My expectations for that may be what ruined this move for me. Do yourself a favor, don't go into this movie expecting a Western. This doesn't feel like a Western at all. It LOOKS like a western. The setting is country. They try to show the characters living country lives, but the whole drama and story around all of the characters could have literally existed in any city and this clearly only was told in a Western setting for the narrative overall message by the original author.

So, it didn't satiate my desire for a Western. It also was kind of boring... or maybe slow is the right word. I suppose it is somewhat interesting enough to keep you watching the film. I never once felt disinterested in the film. I just was aware of the time at several times of this film and good movies you typically get lost in and forget to check the time or don't want to.

All I can say is this, if you want to watch a film with good performances and a somewhat interesting character driven drama, that is semi-unique, though maybe less-so now, you might enjoy it. I wasn't crazy about it personally. I feel like the reviewers are treating this film almost like they treated *Black Panther* like it was the second coming of super hero films and the greatest movie in a decade, when it was merely a ""pretty good Marvel film."" Worth watching, but do NOT believe the hype around the review ratings, which I suspect are there largely because of the underlying theme around Homophobia and being a repressed ""gay"" man in the Western setting. But, this is no Brokeback Mountain.

Just my opinion.",r8fya7
hn6l7fh,"Peter was such an unlikeable asshole, i can't even. Which  is Kind of disappointing because He was introduced as a likeable and sweet character in the first scenes but as soon as He killed the bunny, i lost all my sympathies for him. As Well as killing Phil, who had issues but he certainly didn't deserve to die. While He was rude to Rose and avoided her like plague, he wasn't abusive to her.

I wasn't that impressed by the movie, i wasn't so fond of the quasi neutral and laconic narration style, which keeps you at distance with the characters and which is so popular in these types of movies but which feel Kind of shallow at the end of the day.

I actually think this movie suffers from something that i call ""the arthouse paradox"" and which is a phenomenon that imho many movies that want to be regarded as artistically challenging tend to ruminate various tropes Like clockwork and because of that they all look the same:

--> minimalistic camera Work with many Static shots

--> many wide shots

--> pseudo neutral Tone of narration

--> Plot enfolds itself mostly by slice of life moments of characters

--> little Dialogue

--> many shots where only the scenery is shown and No characters

--> Open ending with no real emotional closure

--> the characterization of the characters is hazy at best, the viewer is kept at an arm's length and doesn't get the opportunity to sympathize with any of them, because they doesn't really get to know them



Plus, i find the movie incredibly homophobic but that could be because of the book.

hnd6ydx,"I think the movie works much better as a mood piece than it does in terms of plot points.

I think the term subtle really applies here, and perhaps too much so. It feels like Campion went as understated/unspoken as possible. For me, and from my glancing around this subreddit, a few others, it left me feeling a little bit like ""Huh?"" at the end.

Reading the plot summary on Wikipedia (it mentions, for example, that Phil was using Bronco Henry's handkerchief when he's naked in the river and Peter happens upon him) and some on Reddit solidified a lot of what happened to me. But I wish I was able to take that way from the movie itself, rather than having to do some homework. Again, it's a fine line - that folks actually understood what happened shows that it didn't go over everyone's head.

I think what also didn't help, for me, was that so much of the character motivation was so deeply beneath the surface it didn't feel.. motivated. Phil's animosity towards Rose is so passive aggressive that her hitting the bottle/refusing to play the piano felt like she was being extremely brittle. As a result, Peter deciding to protect her the way he did felt extreme to me. Phil having a change of heart towards Peter came out of nowhere, and from that point on towards the movie we don't see he and Rose interact, so it makes you wonder if he still hates her or not.

The movie definitely succeeded on an ambience level - the score, the way scenes build, the overall tone, etc. I just think in terms of what actually happened, it was a little too abstract for me.",r8fya7
hnlpwwg,"Overall, a good watch. The Pros:

- Great cinematography
- Great acting
- Amazing score

My issues with it (I haven't read the book, but going on some things I saw in other threads/criticism):

- Phil isn't menacing, his ""torture"" of rose just feels like he's being a dick. And you can read into that like he's ""losing a brother"" who he clearly deeply cares about. Because of this, Rose devolving to crippling alcoholism over his behavior feels more melodramatic than tortured

- George being a bad husband - him disappearing might work in literature, but in visual media you need to actively show it. Perspective shift after a marriage isn't uncommon, and I thought maybe I just missed a death scene or him mentioning a long cattle drive

- Character building to Narrative ratio was way off for me. Felt to me like the story was almost an afterthought, and stayed way too short",r8fya7

Couple loose ends I'm trying to tie up:

1. How could Peter have known the contaminated hide would be suitable for his plans when his mom gave away the others without conspiring? The rope would have been done within a few days and so it just felt like too big of a coincidence to not have her in on the plan.

2. Does Phil realize that Peter is the culprit on his way to the hospital, but just realizes he must leave the rope or else further risk death? The look in his eye seemed deranged, but maybe that's just the anthrax.",r8fya7

The entire film can be boiled down to that classic line from *Airplane*: ""Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?

We never find out if Joey (the Boy Who Needs To Eat a Sandwich) likes gladiator movies at all. It's actually a good thing he never swims in the River Of Naked Men, because we'd have to see him naked - and, as I stated before, he needs to eat a sandwich. Possibly two or three sandwiches.

Kirsten Dunst gets to reprise her role from *Interview With a Vampire* where she says ""I want some more"" (blood). In this case the ""wanting more"" means another bottle of Night Train, and that isn't entertaining enough to keep us awake.

In the end, the Boy Who Needs To Eat a Sandwich puts some capuchin monkey virus in BoneADick Slumberbatch's tub of fettucine rawhide noodles. At this point the entire audience has been poisoned by boredom sauce, so none of it really matters.

When Peter was with the infected cow with his gloves on, I knew he was up to something sinister…..but what is really interesting to me and there is not much comments here, is George’s character ….everyone seems to treat him like shit from Phil and also his parents…I caught the line where the mother says she’s not drinking one of his concoction at the dinner party in the most demeaning way ….even the other guests, everyone calling for Phil to join like he’s some God and savior …why ?!!….the ranch hands also worshipped Phil and seem to ignore George unless his brother was there… And did Phil force his brother to sleep in the same bed/room with him?  Poor George just wanted to be loved … he knew Rose was going off the rails because of Phil but he would never give her up …set her free….a bit selfish to me…
This thought is now on Peter, when he walked up to those nesting birds, I think it may have been all a show for Phil, since he found Phil’s magazines, it’s like he knew his weakness and this is where Peter became the dominant one in their dynamic …the scene where he was giving him the smoke from his hands, I think he’s torturing Phil unbeknownst to Phil…",r8fya7

hxa0n29,"Take a drink every time you see a specific element in this movie that was also in a recent Oscar-nominated film:

* Gay cowboy

* Abusive criticism of a music performance

* Benedict Cumberbatch hiding his bad American accent behind an old-timey dialect

* Score by a guy who used to be in a famous rock band

* Meticulous sound design meant to focus in on a few very specific objects

* Roman numeral chapter cards

I ultimately liked this movie, but not until the end. There's a point where understated setup just becomes bad pacing. Basically everything interesting in this movie happens in the second half. The first is a bear to get through. 

I know we've seen manly-man cowboys who turn out to be gay before, but I do enjoy how we also have the reverse here: an outwardly feminine-looking man who isn't gay (as far as we know). The big theme of this movie for me is how much people put up with from the people they depend on. Phil acted the way he did because the ranch couldn't run without him. Even if George were the type of guy to stand up for himself, he wouldn't have wanted to risk Phil leaving. That's why I'm interested in what happens after Phil dies.

It's funny that a movie that takes itself this seriously has innuendo on the level of Beavis and Butt-head. Lol, he taught him to *ride*, get it, because it's his dick

i13dfbf,"Hello

im just wondering if anyone else thought it was ambiguous what Phils intentions were befriending Peter and making the rope for him? It seemed very out of the blue and calculated to me, and didn’t fit in with his previous interaction with him. I think we were lead to believe he may have intended to kill him with the rope, perhaps by hanging him like his father, partly as the ultimate he could do to hurt Peters mother, especially after giving the hides away, also partly as a reaction to his repressed homosexuality and what he sees of himself in Peter, and also perhaps his fear of his sexuality being exposed by Peter.   
There is one scene the really stood out to me, in the barn with the rope pulled taut and Peter behind it, with the rope at neck level, very suggestive of what could lie ahead for Peter. Perhaps Peter even knew that this was Phil’s scheming plan, and he outwitted him and used Phil’s own weapon to kill himself in a reversal of fates. This was my interpretation anyway.",r8fya7

That said, and this is based ONLY on the movie...but becoming an alcoholic or a murder as a means to deal with a bully just really watered down any sympathy I'd have for Rose or Peter. 

Phil was a jerk yes, but more so a bully. The movie didn't really give Rose a good reason to turn to alcohol. Like ok sure you can't play the piano and think something may happen to your son...but I just can't get behind her reasons. It's just ridiculous. Like tell your husband and out him as a predator. The worst thing I saw Phil do, besides the grooming, was beat the horse. Maybe I've just dealt with people like him too much to really see the ""abuse"" that the movie described as torment.

Phil jogging out on the grounds delirious with anthrax in his suit looking for Ryan to deliver a rope, all while George is slowly driving behind him yelling for him to get in the car is hilarious. Replace Phil with Michael Scott and George with Dwight the scene could be straight out of The office. The scenery could even fit with the beet farm.

Phil stated that Bronco taught him to “see things that others did not”. That stated, I believe Phil was onto something about Rose. That she was in fact an imposter trying to snag a rich man. Think back to the screen early in the film when Peter shares with Rose his scrap book and he shows Rose the pretty bride, her bridal bouquet of flowers, the BIG house with servants, the life they wanted. Rose posed as someone refined, a non-drinker who studied some piano, but it was obvious that she had no clue… it was painful to observe the anxiety Rose felt around the presence of the baby grand piano. This really exposed her.  She also leaped onto full-on alcohol abuse, like it wasn’t her first rodeo. Both Peter and Rose abhorred the inn with all the boozing and common folk. They each wanted to live a high life. Think about the reference to the “stars” being untouchable. Yes, I believe Phil had Rose and Peter all figured out. Remember his letter to the “old man and old lady”. Rose’s relations with George were deliberate and intentional.

I feel that the film would have been better off without those lines, as they stuck in my head the entire film and it stripped the ending of any suspense as I knew it was going to culminate in Peter inevitably saving Rose from Phil. The scenes with the rabbits and Peter's speech about finding his Dad's body would have been sufficient in showing there was more depth and strength in Peter's character than meets the eye.

I liked the film, it was well shot and made great use of the landscape, and the acting was solid across the board, but the film felt like it was lacking something and failed to really drag me in. The film reminded me somewhat of Hud, but its characters, barring Cumberbatch's Phil, lacked the complexity and depth of those found in Hud and felt rather flat.

1) I didn't really understand why Rose was so bothered by Phil's antics.  His antics seemed more annoying than frightening.  She also never talked to her husband about him and instead just resorted to becoming a full-fledged alcoholic.  That seemed out of character for a woman who said she detested alcohol.

2) Again, I didn't really find Phil frightening, and this is further pushed by Phil's reaction to Peter finding out about his Bronco shrine / sexuality.  If Phil was the frightening villainous man he was supposed to be, it seems he would have threatened Peter and told him he'd make his life hell if he told anyone.  Instead, he just accepted that he'd have to become friends with Peter so that he'd want to keep his secret?  

I don't know, to me, the whole decision to start being nice to Peter did not make a ton of sense given how Phil had acted towards Peter up to that point.  

3) The ending sequence was also frustrating to me because I would have found it much more satisfying had Peter come up with a master plan to kill Phil rather than seemingly having one fall into his lap.  The sequence of events was that (1) Phil decided to make Peter a rope, (2) Peter got the hide from the dead diseased cow, (3) Phil injures his hand trapping the rabbit, (4)  Rose sold the hides to the Native Americans, (5) Peter offers Phil the hide from the diseased cow. 

To me it's a much better ending if we have Peter having this masterplan to kill Phil.  Instead, he sort of just lucks into the scenario with Phil hurting his hand and then also needing more hide. Yes, Peter has the diseased hide on hand to do the job when presented the opportunity, and we know he was satisfied at the end of the film by Phil's death and his mother's happiness.  But what was Peter going to do if not for the happenstance events that allowed his diseased hide to become useful?",r8fya7

pete being the dark fem, manipulating everyone around him, phil's brother and his own mother. realizing phil's weaknesses, exploiting them, and luring him into a calculated trap that phil normally would have avoided. the cold unemphatic display of emotion before killing animals without reaction. smiling at the end of movie once phil is confirmed dead.

hsg0zr6,"I wonder if any of the cowhands were creeped out by Peter constantly talking about a long-gone cowboy.


On a more serious note: I just realized that Peter never smiled at his mother. Like a real, full, joyful smile. I didn’t put my finger specifically on that when I watched, but I realize now that’s part of why I found their relationship disturbing, even when Rose was acting loving. Like when she came up and admired his paper flowers, he seemed very uncomfortable with her praise. And then when she suggests putting them on the table, he’s reluctant, but unwilling to say so. Even in these simple scenes, his words are completely at odds with his affect.


ALSO: why did George lock Phil into his own room?? Presumably it’s so George and Rose can sexsay, but was it common to lock people INTO their rooms? Wouldn’t it have made more sense for George to lock his and Rose’s bedroom door?


Final thought: it must have been bizarre for Phil’s hoity-toity family to see their Yale-educated son turn into a unshowered cowboy. They watched him affect an entirely different persona. And it WAS an affectation, just like someone who fakes a British accent.",r8fya7

At first I felt underwhelmed, but the more I think about it and read here, the more I really enjoyed it.

1. Was George also a victim of Bronco Henry? Do you think he knew the truth of the nature of Phil and BH’s relationship? 

2. I understand Phil’s possessiveness over his brother, but why did they sleep in the same room? Is that ever explained? 

3. I interpreted HB as grooming Phil, but some describe it as a homosexual love affair. So was it consensual?  Or was it  abuse? Because those are two very different things, and explain Phil’s behavior in different ways.

4. In the book, are Rose and George more in love? I guess I just didn’t see the appeal, was she a gold digger after all? 

5. What was with that scene between Rose and Peter when they are alone in her room. She’s obviously drunk but says something like “how they see us”. Is this a reference to like their class?

This is the 2nd or 3rd time quite recently that I have watched a movie and knew all along EXACTLY what was going to happen. For example, I recently watched Squid Games and without giving anything away, I called every single plot twist before them happening in my head. And while I enjoyed it, I felt it was so predictable. Then talking to everyone else they tell me how surprised they were.

Same here. I simply followed story all along knowing exactly what was going on. I assumed Phil was gay as soon as he started going on about prosties when he was 13. And who carries on about their mentor that way. I also knew Peter was going after Phil with a plan to kill him as soon as he told his mother that she wouldn't have to live like this any more. And the moment I saw that cow the first word that came to mind was anthrax. I actually thought he was poison him with the blood or something, so using the cowhide was perhaps one little twist I hadn't thought of. When I saw the blood mixed in the water it was pretty obvious that he'd been infected.

So to me, the only suspense was wondering if he'd get caught or if he would succeed in his plan. And when it all went as I thought I found the plot disappointing. I kind of expected Phil to catch on to him, or his mom or George to figure it out or the doctor. But they never did. Now I realize apparently no one else saw it coming and it took everyone time to go back and sort it out.

Toxic masculinity?

What utter bollocks.

Rose was the villain of the movie.

She manipulated her way into George’s heart, hearth, and wealth, and she manipulated her son’s love of her and his sexual identity to get him to kill Phil.

It wouldn’t even surprise me to learn that Phil’s mentor died of alcohol addiction, and that she played the long con there, too. It would definitely explain Phil’s reacting so strongly to her drinking, which reaction was so strangely out of place otherwise. Just as it would explain how fast she “cleaned up”.

She “drunkenly” cries to her son about how bad Phil is to her… after setting the stage VERY early on that “he’s only one man” or some such, conditioning her son to think of him as not only a bad guy, but a vulnerable bad guy, that he himself COULD defeat, if and when it became necessary.

Phil was right.

And he is absolutely far and away the most sympathetic character in the whole movie.

This movie is if anything a mockery of the nonsensical non-concept, manipulative artificial construct of toxic masculinity. Which is not a bad thing of itself, quite the contrary. It is actually a commentary about how such social constructs are fundamentally tools of monetary exploitation. I take issue however with its delivery method.

What's going on here? Was he really opposed to washing up, or was it in the way that George asked that offended him? What does it mean/why include it in the work?

Earlier in the film, the men had already asked what he was always looking at, and he says you can only see it when you see it. Apparently, Bronco showed him, and now Peter just says he saw it from the moment he arrived. Phil really respected Peter for that, and Peter gains Phil’s trust at this point.

Peter calmly reaches in and removes the rabbit. Phil tells him to put the rabbit out of its misery, but Peter pets it and treats it as if it were his own. He snaps it’s neck. The very next shot is of blood on grass, though it’s not clear if it’s the rabbit’s or one of theirs until Peter says it’s Phil’s. 

Peter does the exact same thing to Phil. He lulls him into thinking he’s a friend, maybe even something more. He’s possibly the first person since Bronco who seems to understand him. 

But the movie opens with asking what kind of a person would watch their mother be hurt. Peter sees Phil making his mom’s life hell. She says she hates alcohol, and we find out later she does because it killed her husband. But she’s forced to the bottle because of Phil’s omnipresence. Peter isn’t around to protect her, and he’s already seen how much his mother has changed (she now keeps a bottle behind her pillow). 

There are only two options for Peter at that point. Either convince Phil that his mom is okay, or kill him. I genuinely think his first attempt is the former. But his mom gives away the hides and Phil is ballistic. What’ll happen the next time Peter and George aren’t around to protect her? She’ll drink herself her to death.

Phil is befuddled: “how could this kid know?” Phil didn’t know Peter saw his porn and thought he had hid his homosexuality so well, but Peter is far more calculating than he had realized.

When we learn at the end that Peter is capable of killing someone in a way that looks like something else, it takes us back to the theme of the movie introduced in the opening seconds where Peter is narrating and the scene where he talks to Phil about his father's death.

First, the opening lines of the movie: ""For what kind of man would I be if I did not help my mother? If I did not save her?""

Later Peter admits his dad drank a lot (which often came with domestic violence). Then Peter says, ""Then he hung himself. I found him... cut him down. He used to worry I wasn’t kind enough. That I was too strong."" Phil is perplexed by this observation of Peter's father.

hn9ttvq,"I quite like when a film adaptation takes core elements of a book and rearranges/remixes them to say something new and different than the original work. I didn't see it as a problem at all with this film, I saw it as the film focusing its lens on something different. Another example that comes to mind here is Annihilation. It's more than merely a filmed version of the book; it looks at the same(ish) story in a different light, adding some things, subtracting others, and creating something both familiar and new. That's adaptation in its best form if you ask me.",r8fya7
hnak89e,"This is sort of odd. Rose tries really, really hard to be a good mother actually (yes, big book fan, been teaching it for years too). Her monologue in the book to Peter is very clearly to indicate something fairly fundamental about her: she's more or less defined by continually choosing to be kind and polite, down to her behavior at the dinner table & down to forgetting how Phil might feel when she rushes out to give the hides to the chief because she feels terrible for him and his son. 

She says very early on actually that she loves her son but doesn't know how to love him, and she feels ashamed for saying that obviously, but it's the inherent hardness that Peter already has (and similarly to Johnny—she seems perfectly aware of but supportive of his effeminacy). When she  goes to his boarding school, what disturbs her is definitely not that he has a lover now, but that his room is replete with dead animals.

Sure, it's fair to say Johnny failed his son by killing himself & Rose failed him by becoming an alcoholic—but they loved and wanted the best for him. (This is also fairly commented on by Thomas Savage's biographer—Savage modeled many characters, but particularly Rose, on his mother who he absolutely idolized and sort of made into a saint, almost virginally GOOD). It's also fair to say (both for the book & film) that...... Peter being so bloody calculating from the very start is unnecessary if what he wants to do is protect his mother. He could just...be with her & provide her companionship and support, perhaps? I can see why in the book, there's no way out other than to kill Phil, but in the film I don't think that's true. Phil isn't as terrible in the film as he is in the book, there's a clear way that Rose can recover, Phil can be softer, George can be a better husband.

The major thing I don't love about the adaptation is how it reduces Rose. Rose is a FASCINATING character and basically the other protagonist, except we start with a misdirect in her case by starting from her husband. The book kind of becomes hers really fully (she's the witness to the stories of Lola, Edward Nappo, etc. etc.) But I gotta say: Dunst PACKS IT IN. In the book Rose is a smarter character than she seems—and honestly I LOVE how Dunst still managed to put that across. I think given the contraction of her character (and the change to the Edward Nappo scene, UGH) Dunst was fucking incredible.",r8fya7
ho0vgrl,"I haven’t read the book but it seems like removing the parental theme allows the film to lean heavily into themes of hard vs soft power and conventional masculinity vs non-masculinity (Campion’s wheelhouse).

Phil acts hard as a survival mechanism and bc he has maladaptive coping strategies and a lifetime of repression and internalized shame, which started with his upbringing. Phil torments Rose from the jump, seeing her softness as a weakness, and Peter’s, too. 

Peter, on the other hand, grows up with a mother who loves him just as he is - she puts his paper flowers on their tables - and does her best to protect and provide for him. Peter’s quiet confidence in himself as he walks through the jeering camp, the gentleness he shows to animals just before he kills them, are qualities Rose helped instill in him.  

As Phil grows close to Peter, Rose tries to stop them from going off together and warns Peter to be wary. It’s clear that she can’t protect Peter.

This gives us a showdown between two characters: a swaggering bully cowboy and the Alpha of the ranch who has tormented a woman all her life and driven her to drink, and a slight and quiet boy who makes paper flowers and loves his mother the most out of everyone in the world.

As the two characters draw closer to each other, we aren’t sure who will emerge in the end and who will be destroyed by the other (whether it’s through murder or assault), and this dynamic puts the conventionally masculine (hard) and conventionally non-masculine (soft) on the same playing field, another common Campion theme.

The build-up to end of this film brings to mind the ending of The Beguiled, where the women (*spoiler!*) poison the soldier who’s threatening them and trying to scare them into subservience. Another example of how soft is pitted against hard and expectations are upended.

Soft power.",r8fya7
hnutnh1,"As someone who hasn't read the book, I found the absence of parents came through quite strongly. I didn't even realize that Phil was referring to his parents when he spoke of the ""old man/lady.""

I thought he was referring to an aged couple that he and George had conned out of their ranch. And I assumed they were dead. I didn't really catch on until George says something later on. 

Psalm 22 also references David's immense pain and being beset on all sides by those who seek to harm him further. I think it's fair to say that Phil, Rose, and Peter all suffer from attacks of one kind or another throughout the story.

The line from the title, taken from the KJV in the movie, has some alternate translations. In the original Hebrew translation, ""darling"" means something like ""my only precious one."" Which could reference David, his soul, etc. But it works out to mirror Peter's motivations in saving his mother.

i21hxuy,I watched the movie yesterday. That's why I am a little late in this thread. I didn't read the book. Now it makes sense to me that Phil don't like the native Americans. The father and son that came by. I think he hated that lovely relationship between them. The responsable care of the father made him jealous. So he decided long ago to collect all the fur and burn it. I know that Phil was not in that scene. But I can imagine that he witnessed this very often in his past.,r8fya7
hn8uh1i,"Thanks for pointing that out. I felt like there were parallels in the way Phil/George and Peter’s family dynamics played out but film focused on Peter/Rose much more and scraped the surface with other angles. Which makes one think if parent/child topic got *just a tiny bit* more plot points, would fix all of movie’s weak spots. 

I didn’t read the book so as soon as I knew what Peter’s plan was I got instantly underwhelmed. Is this just what he’s gonna do and that’s it? Is he just a psycho who probably also killed his dad? Then I read some people who read the book commented on Peter’s dad being nice and best character in the book. But if his influence was positive, Peter comes off as callous dick, it’s not a good story. On the other hand, it makes sense for a kid who was traumatised by parents’ weakness and irresponsibility to discard whatever they preach and do whatever it takes. It looked like movie tried to steer it in other direction the whole time but it came back to family in the end anyway.",r8fya7

hn8lka6,"The book says it was a $500,000 dollar enterprise in 1920. Which, according to google, is now $6.9 million-ish?

Phil mentions he castrated 1500 head during the scene where Peter arrives at the ranch.

It was the largest cattle farm in the area, perhaps the state. And, it is because Phil knows his shit. George couldn't have done that.",r8fya7
hn9d3ss,"Early in the movie Phil says they bought the ranch from an old couple 24 years prior, which would be just after Bronco Henry died. My impression is that Phil was a timid, city or town-dwelling greenhorn just like Peter (and was groomed by Bronco at the same age as he attempted to groom Peter), and that he wasn't so much interested in the cattle ranch life as he was in continuing his fantasy and honouring Bronco's life.

He coerced/bullied George into taking on the ranch with him, and George stood in as Phil's platonic partner for almost a quarter century, even sharing the marital two single beds setup with Phil in the same bedroom as one another, despite the spaciousness of the ranch house.

Their parents seem like city folk, and George didn't seem much suited to the life either; The interior of the ranch was very upper-class urban too. I think they came there rich, and renovated and refined everything. Heck, the stables even had the same glazed, vaulted windows as the house!",r8fya7

hn8j63z,"Her role did matter, though. There was a maid in the book and a cook.  


She was there to show that Peter was not interested in her, either as a friend or as a girlfriend. This meant the audience could interpret Peter's character as gay (or ace), if they wanted. It lent vagueness to him.

She was there to show that Rose felt more comfortable hanging out with servant class people than the Governor and her in laws.

She was there to show what normal people acted like. Because Peter, George, and Phil were definitely not normal emotionally.

hww4j6g,"Ok. I am glad you asked, because I had the same question. I have read the other comments and now I get it. But I want to share what was my first theory anyways.

When I saw that my brain went to: this was a big plot to kill Phil! I thought that the old lady was giving her the ring as payment for completing the job (the funeral was a nice place because the job was clearly done). So, I thought that it was all a plan from Rose, Peter and the old lady. And that would also explain why Rose got rid of the hide, that is, so Peter could act.

In my head, it made sense, because how would Peter have the infected hide ready for this opportunity if he didn't know his mother was going to give Phil's hide away? (can somebody explain this to me?) Did he just have a very good timing? What was he planning to do with the prepared hide to begin with?",r8fya7
hnkidwv,">!Just my interpretation: the movie starts setting Phil as a tough-as-nails, dominant, boss-type character, who has seen it all, is a veteran rancher, and in fact sees things that noone else can see.!<

>!He dominates Peter by bullying him, putting up the other ranchers against him, calling him gay, making his mother cry.!<

>!He dominates Rose by bullying her about her piano playing, her drinking, saying she's only in her relationship with  George for his wealth.!<

>!The movie ends with Peter, whom Phil sees as a student in his stories about how to be tough in life, killing Phil with poison without Phil even seeing it. He is so completely dominated by Peter at this point, the roles have been so utterly reversed, that before he dies, the apparent rancher-survivor-tracker-scout asks to ""give his rope"" to Peter, someone he was bullying for being gay in the beginning of the movie. Someone the veteran was trying to teach hard life wisdoms, such as getting back in the saddle, and giving the rabbit a swift kill.!<

>!The movie also ends with Rose, someone he bullied during her whole stay for being in it for the money, getting Phil's wealth, and drinking. He bullies her over her drinking, but he is the one that drinks the poison. He laughs at her piano-playing skills, but he was the one who completely overestimated his own rancher-scout profiency.!<

>!It's a complete, final reversal of how Phil's character got introduced, and a complete pulling the rug under of how he perceives himself, till the very last second of his life.!<",r8fya7
hnwamgp,"I mentioned Phil as a tragic character/story in several comments. And I think you feel the way the movie was intended, death of the artist be damned.

Phil's fate is doubly tragic because he helps create it and because he's almost doomed from the start. His terrible loneliness has perversely but predictably caused him to drive away any chance at meaningful connection.

I am waver on how much of a psychopath Peter is meant to be, but I think the opening quote instructs on (paraphrased: What son wouldn't do everything to make his mother happy and protected after what she's been through?).

Right now, on one watch, I think Peter didn't definitively decide to use the anthrax rawhide on Phil after hide-gate. I think he was scared and believed that now Phil would go after his mother gangbusters; and that in the short time he had left, he couldn't change that outcome. Which would result in his mother's death.

So I don't think Phil ""deserved"" to die. I think he ran into someone more desperate than he was, and if not smarter, at least without the immense self hate that blinds him.",r8fya7
hs0s84a,"Great analysis, thanks for posting.  

Do you think Phil realized what Peter did?  I hope so, and I think he’d forgiven Peter.  Phil understands the things a person can learn to live with, in order to protect his loved ones and himself.  For Phil it’s a lifetime of self-hatred and loneliness.  For Peter it’s murder.

Peter isn’t a psychopath.  He has real emotions: he’s hurt when Phil mocks and destroys his paper flowers (even before they get to know each other), he shows genuine care and concern for Rose, and he respects his father’s courage in removing himself as an obstacle to Rose’s happiness.  I don’t think it’s obvious or even necessary that Peter is gay.  He understands that Phil is cruel (and eventually why).  He recognizes that Phil desires him.  He feeds that desire with a brilliant mix of naïveté and seduction.  But I think he’s going through the motions.  Even so, in my head canon Phil would forgive him.

If you think Phil didn’t know, then he’s devastated that happiness has become possible again but immediately snatched away.  He knows the ride to town is the last ride of his life.  It’s sad, but it’s tragic if Phil’s last action is one of forgiveness…and humanity.",r8fya7

Or was he? What was all that about making a rope for Pete and then going on some wild excursion all on their lonesome? Another reading is that he was going to get rid of Pete just to further hurt Rose.

It is open to interpretation.",r8fya7
i84c959,"Phil's tragic arc reminded me of this quote by James Baldwin:

&#x200B;

* ***I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain.***",r8fya7
hn8mzit,"Phil's entire persona was fake. The reason people think he is so stilted and awkward is because he is a posh, well educated Bostonian boy who moved to Montana with his posh family and is now playing ""macho cowboy"" to hide his true self (ie, he is a brokenhearted gay man who lost his first lover in a tragic accident).  


The bath part is part of the persona that keeps people away. Keep people at arm's length with your stench and your behavior and they are less likely to see through your mask. They just do not get close enough.  


Plus, he was rich enough that he could flaunt this. He hated the world before it could hate him.  


The bathing part was explained better in the book, but the bathroom was too feminine for Phil (because of his mother's stuff), so he bathed outside. Then, after he became a late teenager, the bathing spot because a sacred place because he and Bronco Henry went there. Mud has been a historical way for cleaning things, but I am not convinced that it would help the smell!  


The hula hoop was an energy release. Plus, this is Campion and she likes sexual imagery and the hip thrusting look sexual.",r8fya7

hndj8pl,"to me, it was meant to be that he denied himself of pleasures like an indoor bath in the name of masculinity. phil as a character was pretty bogged down by traditional masculinity. bronco henry, as well as being his lover, taught him (in phil's eyes) what it meant to be a man - cow-herding, horseriding etc. it's also probably likely that he saw bathing outdoors with mud as being more ""manly"" - so this was him trying to be masculine like bronco
  
imo",r8fya7
hn8d2gh,"I think there’s no big meaning.

Phil at one point watches the other guys bathe naked, which is an early hint to him being gay. Phil himself bathing outdoors just points to him being an outdoorsy cowhand type of guy (despite having studied classics at Yale). The mud similarly is just him connecting to the earthiness of the blue collar/working class/cowhand outdoors.

The hula hoop just shows that Peter is awkward and strange. I’m googling the history of hula hoops and it seems they didn’t become widespread until the 50s, which seems rather anachronistic.",r8fya7
hpshkwr,"re: hula hoop scene, I thought it was interesting that right after that, it cuts to Phil spinning a chair on one leg - like with nervousness, they both went to a circular gesture.

>When Major \[the film's production designer\] asked where the title came from, Campion dug into Psalm 22:20: “Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.” It’s about Jesus on the cross when he’s dying. “The atmosphere is full of guts and anguish, and blood and suffering,” she said. “And in a way, sexuality is like human suffering.

So Phil is the one who really flip flopped--becoming a caricature of his idol, Bronco Henry, and rejecting the well heeled life he grew up with.

So I think George and Phil have had diverging paths for a while. Maybe George was more content to play to Phil when they were younger but has never been a true believer. And he's lonely, so that pushes him to make the extra efforts that even Phil has to acknowledge.

George in turn doesn't really seem to exhibit being emotionally adverse to his brother; if anything, he appears mostly indifferent and doesn't realize how much his indifference hurts Phil.

Regarding her alcoholism, seems pretty clear Phil has driven her to it. Peter says she never drank before and I see no reason to doubt that. In the last scene she looks like she's going to be happy with George but Peter's smile into the camera does scare the shit out me.

I think one of the enjoyable and engaging aspects of this movie, and perhaps why I'm seeing so much division in opinions, is that there is never an interaction where both characters don't have something significant in play. 

I see folks interpreting scenes with some interesting takes, but there seems to be a tendency to state: this character was doing this to another, and that ""doing"" was the point of the scene/meaning of the scene. 

I'm not explaining this well, so examples: 

>He was at some point just like Peter, and his outward hatred towards Peter wasn’t due to plain homophobia but rather due to some sort identity crisis he developed from his previous relationship with Bronco.

I agree that Phil's blatant hatred and spitefulness towards Peter was Phil's fear of his own homosexuality and sexual identity. I wouldn't say the identity crisis was caused only or even at all by Bronco Henry. I think that level of self hatred could conceivably come from being ashamed of being homosexual in that time period and location. 

There's some difference of opinion on whether BH groomed Phil or if he just recognized another gay man. Phil's intense love and longing for BH could very easily be because he truly believes that was his only chance at happiness. Literally the only other gay man he would ever meet and be safe with.

>The walk to the tree with the crowing birds amidst the cowboys was Peter’s first attack and it was purely to establish a false sense of bonding with Phil. The way I interpreted that scene is this - he wanted to intrigue Phil by a demonstration of manliness in Phil’s realm of understanding and thus create a suitable ground (opportunity) for Phil to intervene as a perfect mentor. He knew Phil won’t pass the opportunity to recreate the idea taught to him by Bronco

I agree that this is Peter's first salvo. He's a bright boy and has discovered some things about Phil that might explain his behavior. It could be seen as Peter testing his hypothesis and then going into what seems to be a pretty calculated seductive exchange.

I think Phil is apprehensive of Peter at this point. It's never explicity stated, but after having his inner sanctum invaded, doesn't Phil seem like the kind of guy who would check out ALL his secrets stashes and hidey-holes? I feel like he would have known that Peter found the magazines, or at least suspected.

So in this scene I think Phil is also feeling Peter out--is he going to say anything? Taunt him in front of the other men? Reveal  his secrets? Note that Phil does not join in the name calling on Peter's walk. I think it's the first time Phil treads lightly around Peter. Peter doesn't rat him out or, and this is important, treat Phil any differently. It's a kind of acceptance. And Phil desperately wants to be accepted, even as he rejects everyone around him.

>Phil’s understanding of sex versus identity was wrong, and that was due to the faulty relationship he had with Bronco.

I'm not sure what you are saying here. Phil is a homosexual man in a time and place where that could get you killed. He was an outcast. Do you mean that he and Bronco had an inappropriate relationship? That is was abusive and this confused Phil about how to be healthy and happy?

>. I would say Peter was so keen on protecting Rose, not just because she was his mother, but because he is taking on the responsibility of what used to be his father’s which he understood as a role for a man. 

I think it is less about Peter's conception of what makes a man ""manly"" and more about Peter protecting his mother from being hurt again. His father committed suicide, leaving his family in a terribly position. Peter is very willing to let someone else assume the role of husband--he seems to have no problem with George. He only reacts when his mother is threatened and terrrorized. So I can see your point about how that's about being a man, but I see it more as about being a good son. 

I don't think many of these concepts are mutually exclusive. I think you have a more classically critical read of this movie and I appreciate your assessment of the feminist/toxic masculinity themes. 

I think I was more struck by the completely avoidable but still inevitable tragedy of it. We are always our own worst and most deadly enemy. Phil's misery and isolation are so directly related to his choices--choices propelled by fear. Phil, Rose, Peter, and George all deal with varying levels of oppression, all of them are beseiged in some way at various points.

Phil is tragic because he creates his own misery and destruction. Peter is tragic because he knows he has also failed his parents expectations, in a different way. He is driven to kill and I don't think that was his first or favorite choice. I think it's the one he was forced to make.

hn8fbin,"I think it’s possible he knew Rose from before but he mostly hated her because she’s providing her brother something he can’t have (a loving mutual sexual relationship). His homophobia affects his relationship with Peter of course (Peter is wrong type of gay, making flowers instead of being a badass cowboy like Bronco), but re: Rose, I think it’s mostly about jealousy with his brother.

Re: the piano. What’s happening here is mostly social class. Rose plays accompaniment at a very low class form of entertainment (silent movies) as well as some “tunes” (probably Stephen Foster and the like). But she’s asked to play for the literal governor (who remarks that this mansion is one oasis of “civilization” in rural Montana), in a fancy dinner party, on a top of the line piano. Even if she could play a tune with aplomb, it still probably wouldn’t be classy enough for this situation. But she can’t, and she’s humiliated. The fact that Phil can play the banjo better than she can play the piano is the cherry on top. Even this guy who rejects the high class world is better at the trappings of the high class word than she will ever be.

I think the pelts are not that well explained. Within the context of the movie I think she’s just drunk and in this moment gives the pelts away to help the Native Americans who are being turned away by the ranch employees — it’s less a conscious attempt to hurt Phil and more a spur of the moment action motivated by alcoholism.

To me, almost everything had like bright neon letters showing what the story was about. Scenes of Phil fingering the paper flower. Phil lovingly gripping a rope hide. Phil pawing at Bronco Henry’s Saddle. Phil shoving a wooden stake into the ground while eyeing Peter. It’s like OK we get it! Now what else? What’s behind that? But we never quite get there.

So, it could be showing that Rosy was becoming part of the household - apart from Phil.

This is not true at all.

She's a widow, her alcoholic doctor husband died by suicide, which is considered a shameful thing. She's been a working class / lower middle class  single mom in a really male dominated society ever since then.   
Her son is effeminate and gets treated terribly for it, and she wants to protect him.

So she goes from that kind of stress, to the stress of being thrown into an environment where she doesn't feel like she fits.   
Phil is abusive outright, as well as needling her ***all*** the time - showing her she doesn't belong in little ways, like how he can play an instrument much better than she can. He is always extremely negative. He targets her son.   
Phil is the kind of abuser who is skilled at knowing how to hurt and manipulate people in ways that others either won't notice, or will dismiss.

It' obviously not just Phil: Dunst shows the absolute TERROR that is being a working-class woman around rich folks at a dinner party (she can't speak before being spoken to, and everybody ignores her). And then when she chokes, Phil picks at that humiliation. It's not *just* a story about her being terrified of Phil, the context is already oppressive and she's totally unprepared for the level of hostility. I thought she was incredible at selling that. Also, she seems fairly ashamed at herself too, it's not like she's not embarrassed to be folding so quickly. 

When she first gets to the ranch, Phil's first words are to call her a cheap schemer and she sorttt of takes it in stride. Once she starts drinking and tells Peter ""he's just a man"" sure she probably doesn't believe that, but she also kinda doesn't realize how deep the effect Phil is having her is. She ratcheted it up very methodically, I thought it was great and exactly how I'd imagined it.

That has me rolling.

Phil didn't just die, he was murdered by Peter, who had been planning it from at least the time he found the dead cow with anthrax. He found the dead cow with anthrax, stripped the hide, and then after seeing the cut on Phil's hand, offered the hide to him so he would be infected by it. And he did that knowing what a cruel, excruciating, torturous death he was causing.

Phil wasn't just laying in the meadow after a swim. He was in his and Bronco Henry's special place, reliving their time together. It was the only time he could be free to be himself and fully remember and mourn him.

He wasn't just grumpy. He was vicious, and subtly tortured Rose (and less subtly Peter), making her miserable enough to turn to alcohol to get through her days. And he took joy from it. He moved on to taking Peter under his wing - not to help Peter, but to torture Rose even more. She was terrified for her son, thinking Phil would do something to him. Then, when Peter started showing kindness (telling Phil he was good, that he wanted to be like him), Phil started feeling a bond with him and softening - just in time to be murdered by Peter. Peter killed him the way he killed the rabbit, lulling him with gentleness before going in for the kill. It was done so skillfully that *while Phil was dying from the anthrax*, he walked around still looking for Peter to make sure he got the rope.

There were so many details, and every one of them mattered to the story. I know I missed a bunch of them; I'm planning a rewatch just to see those missed details tie in.",r8fya7

Did he want to lull Peter into a false sense of security before he did something malicious to him (again, to ""get"" Rose). Was that rope he was making going to be used to harm/torture/kill Peter? I could just never be sure what the endgame was. Did Bronco Henry really see a dog in the hills or was Phil grooming him by making him feel smart and gifted?

>The meaning of the film's title crystallizes when we hear Peter quoting a line of scripture from Phil's burial. ""Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog."" Here, Rose is the darling and Phil is the dog. Peter did what he deemed necessary to liberate his mother from Phil's noxious influence.

Besides that he called his dad the Old Man and the Old Gent too so I don't think it was a special ire directed towards her.

How is it that a woman who has been able to survive in a rugged place like this as a single mother is completely undone by someone making fun of her playing the piano? That is a brittle-ass spirit, to borrow a phrase from someone else.

Yeah this is very well put. Phil wounding her emotionally is what sets the main events in motion. Yet she so quickly becomes undone in front of him - he plays the banjo over her piano, ignores her when she's in the room and.. that drives her to drink and just give up?  

>Take George (Jessie Plemmons). Do we ever find out anything about his personality or character motivations other than he wants to get married? Why does he just sit around and let his brother be a complete dick to his wife? Why does he never seem the least bit conflicted or bothered by the fact that his wife is drinking herself into an early grave? Why does he have no interaction with his step-son? No clue. Plemmons plays him with a certain stoic seriousness, and the movie treats him with a sort of gravity like he is some character that should be respectable, but I just ended up despising him for having no sort of agency of his own.

I hadn't thought of this until you pointed it out but I agree. He is sort of shown as shy and buffoonish, at least in the presence of Phil, and just generally awkward. He doesn't seem to notice her drinking until basically the tail end of the movie. I get the main point was that he sort of exists the film for the bulk of the second and third acts, but his character should have simply had more presence, or more to do.",r8fya7

i'm with you in that i wanted more character development and complexity all around, but i think the film didn't come out of nowhere with Pete murdering Phil.  throughout his scenes, we get hints that he's intelligent, observant, quick-minded, motivated, fastidious, clever, good with his hands, unfazed by death, wants to protect his mother, and is willing to put a lethal end suffering.  he has the capacity, and it seems likely he planned it for some time.",r8fya7

George marrying Rose is a purposeful choice to try and get away from his brother (for one it gives him an excuse to move out of their shared bedroom). 

That said, I think he really loves Rose and he does stand up for her at times, but he's been verbally abused for so long that he is incapable of taking any action that might actually put an end to Phil's bullying.

The thing with Governor was a man who was proud of his wife. He's been a bachelor for a long time and from.the hints we got from Phil, has been unlucky in love or just discouraged from pursuing anyone due to Phil's jealousy. He has now married a beautiful wife and he wants to show that off. I think where he really goes wrong is he doesn't really know Rose. He thinks she's just being modest about the piano.

The ending isn't open, not really. Peter killed Phil to protect his mother, and to protect himself.

I don't think the movie is homophobic at all. It's about how homophobia and toxic masculinity harmed and warped Phil, and how he's sort of radioactively spreading that toxicity elsewhere.

When Phil goes to sleep in Peter´ s mom hotel/restaurant, there is a slow/wide shot of a rope (""to be used in case of fire"")... folded in a way we associate with hanging in a film.  We later know that the father hang ""himself"". This suggests access to rope and could constitute ""means"" for a crime. Also, Peter later refers that his ""father drank until the very end and... then...he commited suicide"". This could be interpreted as Peter being there in that specific moment (""opportunity"") and ""then"" hung his father or made him do it somehow.  The drinking could have lead to the father to abuse the mother (""motive""). The first words in movie might be Peter referring to what he did to his father, with the movie being what happens next.

Hmmm I still think Peter (in the book) is so callous because he has to be. Not because he doesn't have feelings for the animals.

So he is terrified but forces himself not to show it.

Same with Phil. He has thrown himself into the cowboy-life style  because it is a culture of machismo where you DON'T show your feelings.

Both of them are forced to not show any feelings and their parents just go: that's how he is instead of realising that they are forced to act the way they do. (This only in the book).",r8fya7

hntvs3a,"This is a good example of things not being all that black and white as they may seem in the film. 

In the book George is not very bright. But still Phil IS a bully. But then again - his bullying is ALSO him telling George that ""even though you are not as smart as our parents would like you to be, I am here with you seeing your faults and not leaving"".

Kind of when Phil is accepted as ""dirty"" by George. It is understandable that Phil is not happy when George introduces Rose who doesn't accept Phil as he is/makes George ask him to take a bath = he is not accepted unless he changes and lives up to the more refined standards set by their parents (in the book the bathtub is their parents and Phil refuses to use it).",r8fya7
hntv2i7,"Thanks! Hmmm including these things would be a much more complex storyline. Less black and white and more gray (characters and actions).

I think the movie would have had to be much longer to include those things and even being longer it would undoubtedly still be difficult to narrate the story. Maybe it would actually be better suited for a series?",r8fya7

i2h5qla,I like your perspective!,r8fya7
hnb8cd2,"I agree!

Personally I found the story in the book about parents who in a lot of ways mean well, but don't really know how to accept their children (Phil because he is gay, George because he is not academically gifted, Peter because he is gay, Peters father because he is not academically gifted (yes he is ALSO let down by parental figures)) to be very interesting. 

The book shows you a word where if you don't fit in the mold (not gay, academically gifted) your parents send you as far away as possible and maybe you can come back when you have learned how to behave. The only one who is escaping this is Peter, and ONLY because he quite literally kills for it to happen and because he learns to never show when he's afraid.

The book is a very angry story if you ask me - and very well done!",r8fya7
hpcjvgr,The book goes into detail about how Phil had a chance meeting with Peter’s Dad and went out of his way to humiliate him. I think Peter is played in the movie as perhaps more of a psychopath (is he doing this because he enjoys it?) but his father’s suicide looms large and I think he is acting to prevent Phil from driving his mother to suicide the same way he had a hand in driving his father to suicide.,r8fya7
hnfkocp,"Im sorry if the answer is a bit long 😂

In the book, George not being academically gifted (or maybe better put: Clever with words and charm) is seen a a let down by his parents. 

But the biggest let down from both Phil and George is that neither of them marry in to other wealthy families. Long explanation ahead:

In the book it is stated clearly that the family is VERY rich and VERY old money. It is expected of George and Phil that they get an education and subsequently spend time mingling with their peers and finally marrying into other rich families. They are by no means expected to actually work. Phil working and getting dirty is an act of provocation and is only tolerated because he is so clever and because doesn’t flaunt being gay. He is kind of the weird cousin in the family and he has A LOT of disagreements with his parents. And yes - they (and everyone else) know he is gay.

George doesn’t really have any redeeming qualities - his parents try to marry him of but are not successful and after that they kind of give up on him.",r8fya7

hnb7a6n,"I haven’t read the book but here’s my take: bronco henry groomed phil and it’s possible that phil may have eventually done the same thing to peter, but initially phil’s intent seemed to be to further isolate peter’s mother while making her fear for peter’s life, with probably the end goal of tormenting her to her breaking point so that she left or killed herself or became such an alcoholic that his brother would do something drastic. I think initially the rope was also supposed to be another gouge at peter, knowing that the boy’s father killed himself. After spending some time with the boy, however, he realizes that there’s more to him than he thought, and starts to connect with him in a way that he hadn’t felt since bronco henry, a man he could never even mourn openly and still loves. When the hides are gone and phil loses it, we see phil’s brother side with his wife on the issue. Phil is effectively isolated at this point. I don’t think the rope was actually super important to him, it was that the hides were his (just like his brother was his) and she took them. So we see the rope on bronco henry’s saddle while phil is making peter’s rope and I think, in that moment, the rope is now a symbol of their bond. The man that phil loved carried a rope and now the boy who took his side and looked up to him when he was all alone was helping him make a new one. 

All this to say that when phil is staggering around wanting to give the rope to the boy, it is a genuine attempt to commemorate their friendship while also being an opportunity for him to honor the memory of his lover.",r8fya7
hqnesxi,"Phil was lonely gay man in a time and place where that was very much not okay. And then there was a chance that Peter was gay also. And then Peter murdered Phil. And people told me this was a

hnlodqf,"He did, here's the trail of clues (I think):

1. Early in the movie, Phil points out a cow that died of anthrax and tells the ranch hands not to touch it.
2. Later, while Peter is riding alone, he comes across that dead cow (which presumably died of anthrax). Being a medical student, he knows what it is and what it can do. That's why he puts gloves on when he starts to skin it.
3. After Rose gives away the hides, Phil doesn't have enough to finish his rope (which has become a sort of bonding exercise between him and Peter). Peter offers Phil some rawhide with which to finish the rope — rawhide that he took from the infected cow.
4. Phil becomes infected with anthrax when he dips his open wound into the bucket of water with the bad leather in it.
5. At the very end of the movie, Peter is handling that same rope with gloves on, indicating that he knows it's infectious.

It's not explicit, and the movie \*kinda\* leaves it open to interpretation wether Peter did it on purpose or by accident, but by the end I think it's pretty clear that Peter did it on purpose to stop Phil from terrorizing his mother.",r8fya7

""A hula hoop is a toy hoop that is twirled around the waist, limbs or neck. They have been used by children and adults since at least 500 BC. The modern hula hoop was inspired by Australian bamboo hoops. The new plastic version was popularized in 1958 by the Wham-O toy company and became a fad.  


Native American Hoop Dance is a form of storytelling dance incorporating hoops as props. These props are used to create both static and dynamic shapes, which represent various animals, symbols, and storytelling elements. The dance is generally performed by a solo dancer with multiple hoops.  
Before it was known and recognized as the common colorful plastic toy (sometimes filled with water or sand), the traditional ""hula hoop"" was made of dried willow, rattan, grapevines, or stiff grasses. Though they have been in existence for thousands of years, it is often incorrectly believed that they were invented in the 1950s.\[2\]  
Author Charles Panati records a ""craze"" with the usage of wooden and metal hoops in 14th-century England. He reports that doctors treated patients suffering from pain, dislocated backs, and even heart failure due to hooping.""",r8fya7

Phil being gay wasn't exactly meant to be open to interpretation because that's part of the point of the movie. They showed it rather than outright telling you. He goes from being a quintessential toxic male to gradually becoming more vulnerable because he feels like he can be himself around someone for the first time since Bronco Henry.

The criticism about Rose confuses me. Phil is very menacing and she's clearly on edge in an unfamiliar environment where even her husband can't be a comfort. No wonder she starts drinking to cope.

Peter, Rose, ranch hands, housekeeping staff... none of them have the authority to confront Phil. There is an imbalance of power with Phil at the top, and my guess is that's how Phil likes it. George is the only person in Phil's life who could be considered his peer, and Phil has tormented him into a submissive shell of a person. That's why Rose gave away the pelts - it was something in her power she could do to hurt Phil while he wasn't there to stop her.

However, Rose has a job and has been independently supporting herself and her son for years since her husband died. She wasn’t in poverty, which is important for understanding her motivations. But she also likely couldn’t have afforded for Peter to go to school — he was too necessary to running the restaurant. Marrying George meant Peter could be free to pursue his education, which also meant Rose had to make some big sacrifices. She wasn’t a “gold digger” so she live large off someone else’s money. It was a sacrifice for her son.",r8fya7
hnawel2,"I agree with you, and I definitely agree with the tweet 1000%. I just feel a little like there was too much leaning on Dunst to sell it. Cumberbatch's stuff was made a bit more explicit, Dunst didn't get that. I guess Campion decided to do that a lot more through choreography & non-verbally...but it does still feel like a lesser actor would've failed to get that subtext through, but thankfully Dunst sold it brilliantly.

hwhbaz0,"You know the funny thing? The script actually has a lot of the pivotal lines I really wanted. I'm pretty sure they were removed in the edit because Dunst has said there's a lot of deleted scenes.

For example, before she rushes out to the Native American man, she says to Mrs. Lewis in the script: 

ROSE: What will that little boy feel? A white woman turning away his father, the son of a chief. He’ll never forget it his whole life.
MRS. LEWIS: ‘A white woman’. What can you mean?

And she rushes out without thinking for a solitary second how Phil might react because what she really cares about is how terrible the boy might feel. Again, it's about her fundamental kindness (that Peter ascribes to his dead father but is just as true of his living mother!) Somehow even without this line Dunst prostrates and conveys her immense respect to the Native American man in that scene nonetheless. But that's not something that should've been left even slightly vague. She's literally a protagonist, if I had to make just one change to the edit it would be to keep THAT line. You know? I still adooooooore the film. Really hope Dunst wins, so happy she got her first Oscar nom (also wtf???? I thought she had like 5 Oscar noms by now!l lol)",r8fya7
hwhbtmq,"I don't knowwww if Campion made her ancillaryyyy... I think she captured Rose's perspective pretty darn well. It's just that when you know Peter has got the twist ending and the final act will be Phil and Peter, you need to commit more to Rose. I think Campion's edit focused a lot more on the class aspect (dinner scene) and the beginnning of her crumbling confidence, but certain cuts just made the progression from sensible, capable, intelligent working-class woman to trapped, gaslit drunk who is still aware enough that her son is upto SOMETHING -- that got a bitttt lost.

Then again, Campion also shied away from making Phil as bad as he is in the book. It's much clearer in the book that he's a cruel misogynist who actually thinks Rose does have talent (she makes the paper flowers in the book, not Peter) and also he's a raging bigot (and he turns the Native American man away with shocking cruelty, not Mrs. Lewis).",r8fya7

hnapwxt,"I get that it was misunderstood, this is the one shift from the book that I HATED. It is 100% an act of kindness on her part because she thought they'd be burned anyway.  It's pretty explicit in the book that Rose is galled by the treatment of the indigenous man and his son and rushes off because she's working-class & is more respectful of them than Phil & George. It's made much more obvious in the book that she's open-minded & her heart breaks for the little boy so she impulsively goes out without thinking how Phil might react.

Dunst sold it which is why you got the purpose, but the context of Phil being a huge bigot and Rose...not being one was one level of subtext that Campion took out and I hate the change.

Of course she cares more about indigenous people: she's incredibly impressed that Edward Nappo is the son of a chief (her first husband knew the chief) and she says out loud how it breaks her heart that the little boy has to see his father be treated that way. She rushes out without thinking (in the book she's not *primarily* giving away hides, Edward Nappo wants to tent on the land for a night & Phil, a racist, refuses).",r8fya7
hnb07ue,"I don’t like the interpretation of Peter simply being a “psychopath”. His whole purpose is driven by empathy for his parents suffering (More fleshed out for his father in the book). Don’t get me wrong, he expresses severe psychopathic tendencies in regards to his treatment of animals (Although his medical curiosity and unnecessary kindness negate that interpretation somewhat in my opinion), lack of reaction to provocation, manipulation and methodical calculation. However, his goal is brutal but fairly human. I know if I watched a loved one being abused on a daily basis with no reasonable end in sight, I’d strongly consider a violent end.",r8fya7

Kid did a good job, but I'll have to see more to know for sure. Looks like he's set for a helluva career if he wants it--great role for a young actor to choose.",r8fya7
hnvaps1,"Fair point, but I'd counter with that being representative of how limited her options really were (gender and time period), and how small her focus became under the isolation, lack of support, and relentless terrorizing. 

Her shift from a woman who tells a man she's too busy but falls for him when he waits tables for her to a newlywed that teaches her husband to dance as they take tea by the roadside to a terrified, immobilized, full blown drunk is a pretty damn challenging character arc.  

I haven't cared for Dunst in some past roles, but I appreciate her here. And I like that she now refuses to lose weight for roles. Just a personal thing I like.",r8fya7

hnk1j8m,"I think you are overdramatizing the film. I agree with what Adept-Problem-1530 says completely. The movie doesn't give any backstory why Phil is mean which the book gives so much depth too. 

From watching the movie, the scenes with him where he's being psychologically mean really are coping mechanisms for companionship. I didn't see it as toyiing with her when they were playing music, he was literally just playing with her. Also, he doesn't hide and sulk in the shadows, rather he is always whistling and around. I don't believe any of it is with malicious intent (and if it was! It was never shown to be)

Lastly him not likinng her weakness is not a bad thing, he just doesn't know how to provide comfort because he was never taught how to. He is a smart, hardworking man who had a shit upbringing and maybe for the first time he was given a chance to be seen and heard and he was opening up. But because the other characters were fucked up too they killed him which is the real tragedy.",r8fya7

I think you may be viewing the film too much through the delicate lens of our privileged modern-day lives. You know the principal reward of being tough back then was you didn't die right? I can agree with you that yes some of Phil's behaviors are indeed destructive and unnecessary in today's world. However, Phil seemed like a principled and forthright man who was striving for companionship and struggling to communicate his needs. He did the best he could with the upbringing and tools he had. He came across as more insecure than 'toxic'.

But that part of the movie wasn't about having to guess what would happen next (her descent into alchoholism)--it was about the tension of wondering how bad it would get and would Phil and the constant promise of violence ever be realized?

Random aside: I think the way Rose is menaced by sound in the movie is stellar. It's not just Phil's words, it's the spurs, the banjo, the whistling her failed tune, calling to her son like he calls to the dog--it's sadistic and diabolical.

And now that I think of it, Phil may have been inspired by Rose and George invading his space in every way, including having to listen to their lovemaking. He can't escape his increasing isolation. So he makes her as unwelcome in her home as he feels.

Still a fucked up unit, no doubt. But a tragic one.",r8fya7

hoqlg82,I'm like 90% sure that he killed his dad so his mom would happier,r8fya7
hqnyyif,"I think there is more to the opening scene….
Peter was the one to find his father when his dad committed suicide by hanging.  Hum?  The dad was an alcoholic who died because of drinking….Hum?  The mom cries a lot….Hum?

My take is that Peter killed his own father for similar reasons, namely to protect his mom perhaps from abuse or some kind of emotional pain associated with being married to a severe alcoholic.  I also find it interesting that both Peter’s Father’s death and Phil’s death had “ropes” and images of ropes surrounding them. 

So, this isn’t the first time Peter has killed to protect his mom.  

Furthermore, I’m wondering if Peter is a killer at heart….He kills small animals a lot.  He says it’s because he wants to be a surgeon….Hum?  Maybe there is more to that than just wanting to be a surgeon?  He feels power or intrigue when he kills.  He plans and enjoys it.  He likes looking at the blood and seems to be drawn to the grotesque scenes of death and carnage….the dissection of a rabbit, the anthrax cow, etc…Maybe he likes the idea of being a surgeon because he can look inside living creatures or because he feels powerful or because it’s an excuse to play with blood/guts….? My point is, that there is more to this movie than that Peter killed Phil…I really think he probably killed his own father too.  He even said that his dad was scared of him because he was so strong.  Maybe his dad was scared of his son Peter for his own life.  Maybe his dad was driven to drinking for because he new something was very wrong with his son or for some other reason

hnr2srd,"Personally no. I have one basic reason. Phil was assaulted by Bronco. We don’t think of it directly, but that’s what happened. Phil considers this “love.” 

Even as he’s grown up he thinks Bronco is the only person who understood him, instead of thinking that he was raped as a child. 

Phil is someone who is blinded his emotions. He wants to crush Rose, and is indifferent to the pain he causes her. He loves Bronco, and doesn’t think it inappropriate that he had a relationship with him when Phil was still a child. And he has feelings for Peter that blind him to what could possibly be his death. 

As I pointed out, Phil doesn’t take anything from anyone. But he takes something from Peter. And if you watch the scene where Peter offers the hide, he takes off a glove and touches Phil with his bare hand. Phil then asks why he has hide, clearly suspicious of Peter. But Peter says he wants to be like Phil. 

The Phil at the beginning of the movie was not the same as the end of the film Phil. Early movie Phil wouldn’t take it, only because it came from Peter. Even if he needed it, he wouldn’t stoop so low to accept it from the son of Rose.

To make matters worse, George believes he's being kind and supportive by talking up her piano playing abilities when she knows she's not good enough to perform for the Governor and this completely paralyzes her at the piano in front of company. She is deeply, deeply humiliated to have this happen in front of such illustrious guests and her new in laws. And then it literally shows her starting to drown her feelings if shame and humiliation in alcohol.

Rose is nervy and skittish, yes, but having him kill the chickens is sort of just about how Rose can be very conventionally feminine in being so skittish of getting her hands dirty. I don't think Rose fails her through these ways—she's very clearly trying her level best in the beginning & even after Johnny dies to keep them afloat and then later to marry George so Peter can go to school. And yes it sucks that she becomes so ""weak"" by folding, but she tries and tries. She's literally telling him to be kind and soft all the time (well not...literally, but that's what the monologue Dunst KILLS is really saying in both the book & film.)

Honestly I see who Peter becomes by the end as Rose's absolute worst nightmare. Goddam I really do love how Dunst played this thought. I genuinely think she captured Rose ( how in the alley she plays it like she probably-kinda knows Phil is right there, how with Peter's killing of the rabbit she has a certain nonchalance despite subsequently putting her foot down.) Rose is a LOT smarter than she thinks she is, but she's just so damn insecure. I feel like that came across so beautifully.

Just because Phil can play the banjo really well??? Rose just comes off manic and unhinged. She should’ve invited Phil to just harmonize their instrumental skills during dinner.

hnavzis,"Yeah, I mean—I think the scene with Edward Nappo, the fact that you got that is really credit to her performance because her character is quite contracted from the book (which is just as much about her as about Phil, whereas she's more of a supporting character in the film). 

She's touched because it's like...a lone act of kindness that even her son isn't really giving her. It's really sad. It feels a tad misplaced and without context in the film which I don't loooove but yeah I think she made it work.

In her films, what’s conventionally thought to be strong yields before what’s conventionally considered weak. What’s considered weak reveals itself to be strong in its tenacity, patience, and resilience.

SPOILERS:
POTD really brought to mind Campion’s The Piano for me, which also takes place in a small, isolated living-off-the-land community.

They do not need to run this ranch.

The skins are a byproduct of butchering the cattle for meat. They ate mostly beef - every time the movie has a scene in the kitchen, there is a huge slab of beef waiting to be cooked. The curing is just leaving them to dry, so that doesn't take much effort.

Almost immediately, Phil is visibly suspicious of his brother. Not having yet seen George interact with Rose, he still exclaims ""He'd better not come back hitched"" when George drives off into town.

Furthermore, even after he moved back to the East coast, Teddy’s “cowboy” past became an important part of his persona, to the extent that it was one of the things he was most well known for.

In a different way a rope had taken away her husband.  Not for nothing the hides given away become a gift of gloves.  The gloves both keep Peter safe and rather than the hides being turned into an instrument of loss the substituted image of gloves becomes the means by which Peter is able to put a hand on the situation and turn the table.  Though Peter may have been plotting before, Rose's actions open a clear road for him as the infected hide is now the only material available.

Even his relationship with his brother smacks of creeping incest at worst and possessiveness at best—he never crosses the line, but he hits the boundaries frequently, from visiting him in the bath to taking offense when his brother expresses interest in doing anything that doesn't directly involve Phil, to the fury when he takes a wife.",r8fya7

However comments here say that in the book the family are aware of Phils homosexuality so it doesn't seem likely they'd be holding out for him to find a wife so I'm not certain.,r8fya7
hnr3nj9,"> Where is that from?

It is a shameless plague.

From here:

https://old.reddit.com/r/GeometersOfHistory/comments/kxenty/a_recreation/

... which is the Poem that completes the Story:

https://old.reddit.com/r/GeometersOfHistory/wiki/tales/beginningi",r8fya7
hnbgkai,"A number of reasons. Keep in mind that Phil is emotionally broken and hates the world (except for George) because he thinks of himself as a pariah (this is in the book). A lot of what he does is from spite.

Phil was like a child. He collected a lot of things and was very selfish and proud about them (all those animal heads were from Phil - he shot and taxidermied all of them). The hides were just one of the things he collected. He didn't need the money and he doesn't share. Burning the hides is one way for the author to show Phil's wealth and how he stands apart from the world (how isolated he is - he has no empathy for himself, so how could he possibly have empathy for others).  


Phil is also a terrible racist in the book. It is touched on lightly in the movie (when they are in the yard on horseback and Peter plays with the dog - Phil is talking about moving Indians off the land, but in the book, he is much, much worse). Phil burns hides instead of selling them to the Indians (which is ironic, since he loves collecting arrowheads and spear points).",r8fya7

ho7x16e,Ya like a 1925 fidget toy,r8fya7
hpk1nz3,It's a circle.,r8fya7
ht9t0ow,"Benedict Cumberbatch called the book “a great character study” in an interview and I think that’s the perfect description. It goes a lot into Phil’s character, including much of his internal dialogue, and less so (but more than the movie) into Peter’s and Rose’s. I highly recommend it. As for Bronco Henry, there is a similar nature of mystique and additional vague hints but few additional hard facts. There is much more information about Peter’s father than is in the movie. But overall, the mood, story, surprise ending, dialogue etc are well adapted and highly reflective of the book. If you’re gripped at all by the film, I recommend the book as a deeper delve into the characters’ inner lives.",r8fya7
hxeez6n,That’s a good point. But then it would totally disregard Rose’s hate for Phil. She dreads his sheer presence and her whole character descends into turmoil because of him. I doubt she was trying to save him.,r8fya7
hnlns6r,"Yes, I think they made it pretty clear that Peter doesn't enjoy killing. He takes the time to be kind before he kills: he takes the rabbit he ends up dissecting home and let's his mother cuddle it, he pets the second rabbit before breaking his neck, and he shows Phil affection right before he gives him the infected hides. I agree with others that this partly calculated to prevent the animals or Phil from picking up on danger, but as you see the morning after Phil is infected you see Peter has been crying in his room. I think he is genuinely remorseful to kill Phil, but I think he knows like it was never to kill the animals it was necessary to kill Phil and protect his mother.",r8fya7

hn6tewr,My Samsung is In a bad way with with some wavy shadow type stuff that's permanent and I thought some of the mountain shots were excellent. I didn't really notice the trailing stuff in the night shots either. Your TV might have some settings on that are messing it up.

hogdbm5,thanks for the recs!,r8fya7
hqriy32,">I always hate the ""Closeted Gay Bullies Gays"" trope

For me a further twist was that Peter might not even be gay, after all.  It betrays our own prejudices that we assume the effeminate boy who makes paper flowers is gay, even though Peter never expresses any sexual interest in anyone (for example it's never implied that he revisits Bronco's gay magazines).",r8fya7
ho8akmp,"Fr, everytime a main character throws a homophobic slur ya just know he’s closeted",r8fya7
hu0ehrs,"Then, I wonder, why did Peter make the diseased hide in the first place? He couldn’t have known the others would be given away.",r8fya7
hyvpi3n,"Super late but this was one of my favorite parts as well. We're too used to stereotypical narrative tropes where even the cruelest abusers eventually get absolved by the power of forgiveness and redemption the second they show a bit of softness, and the fact that Phil never received this absolution from those he tormented the worst was refreshing. He was like an emotional terrorist - Rose and George both operated as if they were living with PTSD because of Phil's sheer intimidation of the household.",r8fya7
hnur0ef,"I'm moved to read the book now, for sure.

And I can see Campion's choice here. Phil's death is far more affecting precisely because we see he is capable of some type of affection and tenderer emotions. While Peter's actions throughout had me wondering if he were a psychopath, they also weren't entirely heinous. He was, after all, defending his mother the only way he figured he could win.

A difficult movie in many ways, seeing a woman victimized so thoroughly in her own home. I guess a further point is that Phil's unrequited lust and blooming love are the emotional punishments an audience needs to see to even the score, so to speak.",r8fya7
hnbppzo,This. I didn’t know if I was waiting for a suicide or some sort of “monster/s” to come down from the hills and wreak havoc lol,r8fya7
hu7euuu,"Yup. Extremely awkward interactions that had me laughing out loud at some scenes, tbh. Other scenes, like when Rose refused to play anything on the piano, were too cringey for me. I had to pause it for a few seconds.",r8fya7
hndzo1n,"For me the constant tension came from the characters' interactions and relationships with one another. It cast a creeping dread over the entire runtime. I got the feeling from the first minute of the film that things weren't going to end well for someone - and I didn't know who, up until the very end.",r8fya7
hnux1bz,"I actually felt this was true of ""There Will Be Blood."" Pardon my copy paste of what I said elsewhere:

>It reminds me of ""There Will Be Blood"" in that respect. Nothing happens for the first part of that movie, but I was on tenterhooks regardless. Probably note a coincidence that Johnny Greenwood did the score for that film as well.

Perhaps ""Blood"" would rate more highly for folks because there are violent ""pay offs."" But I think the lack of physical violence towards humans, but played out again and again against animals, occupies that slot. There is no doubt this is harsh environment filled with men capable of physical violence.

Thus, even more tension as Phil ups the torment of Rose without ever touching her.",r8fya7
houdq2h,"Yeah I didn’t think it was bad, I’d give it a 7/10 but the amount of people saying this is a best picture contender and one of the best movies of the year is crazy to me. It was still super boring at many parts. Glad to hear you liked it, just felt it was obviously building to the boy killing Cumberbatch’s character and it could’ve chopped like 20 minutes or atleast added something more dynamic in those scenes.",r8fya7
hnbbe1o,"But, I knew Phil was going to die when he left the party to find George and couldn't because he was with Rose. Why do that? He obviously had a bad relationship with his brother... another point instantly driven into the ground with all the fatso comments. We get it, you treat him like shit and he's pissed. You are super repressed. 

The movie did not gradually show us Phil was gay, it was pretty easy to recognize from the start. Stroking Broncos saddle wasn't exactly subtle. 

Rose was a normal person one minute then a wreck the next for no other reason than Phil was a dick. She just won the lottery and were supposed to believe she can't handle Phil? This is fine, but then she also provoke him by giving away the hides. Another question I have is why he cried over the hides in the first place.

I just think the movie needed more time to hash out the characters. They needed time to play a bigger part in the movie.",r8fya7
hs0x28s,"I don’t think George had enough power to truly confront Phil.  George can’t run the ranch. The ranch hands don’t respect him and won’t take orders from him.  Not only can Phil do the work, he’s much better at it than any of the ranch hands.  But he chooses to teach them and live among them.  They idolize him for it.  If George pushed hard enough, Phil could tell him to fuck off and run the ranch on his own.  The crew would follow Phil wherever he decided to go.  And if Phil leaves, there won’t be any more dinner parties with the Governor and his wife.  They come for Phil and his Ivy League conversation skills (which are probably hard to find in a place where ranching is the main industry and is nowhere near a fancy university).  George is dumb and boring.  He doesn’t understand how to function in “high society” - they’re expecting a Beethoven sonata and he’s excited for Rose to play show tunes.  That dinner party was painful until Phil showed up.  So the Burbank ranch would lose its staff and its political support if George tried to stand up to Phil.",r8fya7

hsfzqi2,"I think it can be a mix of both. George is clearly very kind and safe. She probably felt warm affection for him.

Also, my first thought when she appeared was that it probably wasn’t terribly safe for her to run a restaurant with her wimpy son. I was wondering where she had her rifle stashed.",r8fya7
hnawm2s,It actually makes me a little sad (although ig it's understandable?) seeing the movie's low audience score on RT lol. I'll be frankly shocked if it wins BP (as much as I think it deserves it) but I'm hoping Campion and atleast some of the actors don't go unrewarded.,r8fya7
hwipoei,"I think that’s maybe it’s the character development I was getting at- she was not really “Rose” in the screen play so much as she was George’s wife and Peter’s mother.  We don’t get to see her as the confident working class woman- she is pretty much immediately undone by Phils cruelty which doesn’t make sense and doesn’t give her much depth, especially, as you have pointed out, when Phils cruelty has been so played down in the film.  Dunst’s brilliant performance is the only thing that gave her much depth in my opinion.",r8fya7

Many psychopaths are interested in taxidermy / harming animals / doctoral practices (mainly surgery).

Yet he had killed it the next day.",r8fya7

But we hear that both Peter's parents are worried about him: being ""too strong,"" killing animals in the house for science, hints of being disconnected from other people and possibly normal morality.

So, yeah, she could be worried that Peter will do something outside the normal moral compass to Phil. But I do think her hysteria in that scene comes from her fear *for* Peter and *of* Phil, not from her fear of what Peter might do to Phil.

He would do anything, kill his own father, say he hung himself and he cut him down. Immediately, I thought he murder his father for the sake of his mother and him. Then, she saw that similar masculinity in Phil being mean overly aggressive even in the restaurant. She married George so her son could go to college and have a better life, she knew he was brilliant and saw a way of helping herself and her son by marring a wealthy caring man. I wonder if George had the same experiences with Bronco Henry? I thought that's what Phil wS referring to about the things that when on up in those hills? He then married Rose out of being simplely trying to correct or do the so-called moral thing by marrying her as a cover-up and not just having sex with a woman like Phil said. You don't have to marry them. Implying just have sex with a prostitute or willing woman. I was confused if Phil loved his brother  or if they did things sexual together with each other or Bronco Henry  or if he just knew or what. Them both sleeping in the same bed, after him searching intently for him. That's why she started to get mad at Rose, taking his brother from him. When he was used to things being his way and George always coward to Phil, in the scene, in the bed, after he found him, then in bed toghther and George not looking lije he wanted to be there In my mind that's why George unbuttoned his pants, maybe to pleasure his brother cause it's the only person who knew about him and Phil had a hold on George  and that's why's he would just give in to Phil's demanding ways and name calling. Also, George goes and marries Rose without telling anyone, including Phil, even knowing it would surely make a point that was going to be over. Was George gay also or just confused, maybe? George saw an opportunity with Rose in need of help, support, love or better life. Maybe himself needs her as a shield from Phil or even thought he  could love her.
That's why Gorge didn't want to dance and felt awkward when she wanted to stop looking out into the hills, that might have brought back trauma, or fear of Phil's reaction, or regret his discussion, or just confused on how to be with a woman. Great movie. I guess you can tell it really got my imagination going. I truly wanted more. Thought even more experiences between Phil's attempts to groom him as the next dog, a person who could love him and understand him. George and Phil's parents didn't seem to be affectionate loving parents, especially the way the mother was talked about and overbearing.

He doesn't need to wear boots, and he's not afraid of his mother making him a ""sissy"". In his bedroom, Peter (wearing gloves), genuinely admires Phil's rope. It's like we can consider the beauty that was inside of Phil, and how sad it was that his fear of the feminine inside of himself, and his anger at its existence, was suppressing it in everyone around him as well.",r8fya7
hqdyjuz,"Just finished it and I kinda get what you're getting at, but at the same time, there's no reason to think that Peter is a ""good guy"" in this film. I thought the movie did a great job of making us hate Phil at the very beginning and sympathize with Peter. And then over the course of the film I found myself understanding and sympathizing with Phil more. Like, he's still a dick, but at least I know *why* he's a dick now. He's a repressed gay man in a time and place that, as we saw over and over again, would hate him for it.

But him being a victim of his circumstances doesn't absolve him of being a dick. Just like Phil being a dick doesn't absolve Peter of literal murder. Like, Phil was a dick, yeah. But what did he actually *do*? He never attacked anyone. He never even directly insulted Rose (which is alluded to when he says he won't talk to her about the hides, but is going to make sure George does). The most you can say is he was a dick and a bully. But that's not a capital offense.

So I think you're not really *supposed* to feel good about the ending. Peter is not a good person. The movie intentionally sours you on Phil at the very beginning, then slowly he becomes more understandable. Then you actually see him start to develop as a person and be better to someone he had wronged earlier. You start to actually appreciate him and hope for good things. Then *bam*, he's murdered. And it feels bad, because you've started to grow attached to Phil just before his life is cut short.

The film gave you a douchebag of the highest degree, made you like him, and then killed him. At least, that's what happened for me. And I appreciate the skills it takes to make a film do that.

It's a tragic ending, not a happy one.",r8fya7
hr46siv,"It's based on a book by a gay author. It's quite a stretch to say that it was meant to portray gay people as vicious. I think it was a very well thought-out idea to make Phil resentful of the world as it resents him as a person due to his homosexuality (even though he hides it very well). There's even a line in the book: ""he had loathed the world, should it loath him first"". So yeah, it's actually quite deeper than ""How could you make a gay person the bad guy?! Homophobes!""...",r8fya7
hqh9gqk,"All of this is obvious, it is clear that the way the world has treated him has made him into what he is, not his gayness. You are right, this is why he is repressed, and it changes nothing. And by about the middle of the film it is very obvious Phil is both the victim and the tormentor. Unfortunately, he runs into another one of those, who also knows how to dig into weak spots. Peter uses that, that's it. No one in the audience thinks he's a hero vs. the villain Phil. They are both villains and not villains, reality is complicated.",r8fya7
hr4pi3u,">Diversity win the killer is neurodivergent. 

Interesting take on the neurodivergency. I thought Peter's portrayal was queer in an effeminate way. The power of the femininity?",r8fya7
hrxv0re,Hmmm.  I appreciate your perspective though for me I felt Phil was only a shitheel because he was bitter about being unable to love and be himself.  That he was envious that his brother could.  So i actually developed sympathy for Phil despite his cruelty.  I felt you understood where having to shut himself off from love … as well as being bitter at the loss of Bronco Henry made him who he was and I felt sorry for him despite his cruelty to Rose.  But I definitely think Peter was also gay. He talked about his friend back at school in such away that led me to believe he wasn’t a virgin here either.  He didn’t need to be groomed by this older repressed man when he was already actively living by his own terms.  Instead he was grooming Phil to feel safe and using his own sexuality to do it.  Just like he made the bunny feel safe.  And he said he likes bunnies too but he also saw what he needed them for.  I didn’t see hate crime but I did see a sociopathic puppet master who knew how to play the long game and could play it because he too was gay.,r8fya7
hpadrh4,I like your take on this. I kind of felt like in this day and age we should be past the trope of. Oh he’s a sadistic asshole because he’s gay and it’s the before times!,r8fya7
httsjae,"I  believe Phil was a spiteful bully (aka shitheel) bc he was groomed and then molested by Bronco Henry. I suppose he could have just been gay and Bronco Henry could have recognized that and started a relationship w him, but it read to me more like grooming and pedophilia. This would explain his constant need to prove himself, his feelings of insecurity, his bullying, his hiding place. This is also why Phil, a man who we know is highly intelligent is able to be duped by Peter, he is stunted.

My question is did Phil sitting in his bed w his anthrax hand realize the plan Peter had executed? And is that why he was trying to give Peter the rope…to infect him in revenge or was he simply that duped/taken w Peter that he felt compelled to make sure he got the rope gift?

Also I didn’t find the terrified Rose storyline convincing…Phil was mean, but overall they had little interaction that we saw.",r8fya7
hzfd3o3,"Personally I found it interesting that the gay cowboy Phil was killed by another character who was also written as gay (Peter, who warmly mentions a male friend at school, shows interest in the the nude photos of men etc.)

I felt it was more about Peter rejecting a certain expression of masculinity (embodied by Phil.)

The movie is based on a novel written by a gay man and draws from his experiences as teenager on a ranch.",r8fya7
hq5y5ky,"I really appreciate you stating this, thank you. I admit I would not have been able to see this with my own lens.",r8fya7
huw2vyf,This is exactly how I felt when I watched the movie.,r8fya7
hq7hlsi,I think Phil got infected when he dunked his hands (and his bleeding cut) into the bucket of water that Peter had put the hides in.,r8fya7
hplpvfe,So many layers and juxtaposition in this film. Contrast Phil refusing gloves for the castration to Rose exchanging cow hides for... gloves. Gloves that she cherishes and refuses to take off.,r8fya7
hrii7jg,"Speaking of forewarning, what about that scene where Rose and Peter are in his room and they are looking through his collage, and they point to the large house. He asks her if she would like one like that, she says it would be too much to clean, he says it would have cleaners...! There must also be something to the flowers he makes that Phil then burns, and the rose petals he plucks from his mom's bouquet.",r8fya7

hntx8vs,"whoa you opened my eyes on a possible assault. in the cattle drive scene, phil suggests him and george go elk hunting like they used to with henry. the look on george's face makes me think george was also assaulted by henry on the elk hunting trips. and the two of them went opposite ways. phil worshipping henry and george finding a distaste for ranching.

it seems like phil is basically emulating henry in every way since he worships him so much. with the way the other cowhands seem to worship phil so much, i wonder if he has already tried something with some of the cowhands.

another callback in the beginning is when george asks phil if phil will ever use the bath in the house, meaning phil never does. i wonder if the river bath was an early morning ritual between phil and henry.",r8fya7
ho3ply5,"Interesting. To me, it felt like Phil instantly knew he'd been done-over. His demeanor throughout that scene, when he said ""Where's the boy?"" almost screamed of understanding. He holds the rope tightly before dropping it. And what does he do? He puts on his best suit and hat, because he knows that's a car ride to his grave. To me it feels like he understands the score the instant he's been beaten.",r8fya7
hokyazb,"The scene in the book where Peter touches Phil is really something, and it’s amazing that they were able to capture it on film so perfectly. “Phil, at that moment, in that place that smelled of years, felt in his throat what he’d felt once before and dear God knows never expected nor wanted to feel again, for the loss of it breaks your heart…. The boy wanted to become him, to merge with him as Phil had only once before wanted to become one with someone, and that one was gone… Ah, God, but Phil had almost forgot what the touch of a hand will do, and his heart counted the seconds that Peter’s was on him and rejoiced at the quality of the pressure. It told him what his heart required to know.”",r8fya7
ho755ya," But he wasn't a child with Bronco, he told Pete he met him at his age..",r8fya7

ho3c22d,"Theres no evidence  of assault.  There is alot evidence for Phil's love for bronco.

Phil's toxic masculinity is his way of hiding his homosexuality because no one can doubt hes a 'real' man and not a nancy. 

Hes cruel because of his projected self loathing outward.",r8fya7
hq3v4ue,There is absolutely no indication that he was assaulted. He was an adult when they met and gives no reason to believe the relatiomship was not mutual. In fact if you're going head cannon on this theres more reason to assume they had no sexual relationship than to assume he was molested.,r8fya7
ho1rvnl,Agree he didn’t and that’s one of reasons why I enjoyed the  movie. I understood that Phil died from Anthrax but I just couldn’t fathom that Peter had it in him to be a murderer. For a while I even considered that Peter wanted Phil to get sick but death was not intentional. Great casting and acting.,r8fya7
hr1abwd,"I'm not sure why you say he was assaulted by Bronco.  It appeared to be mutually consensual. 

At the end of the film we see Phil going into the barn to look at the rope he made the night before and asks where Peter is.  So he probably does have some idea that anthrax was on the hide.",r8fya7

hv234tb,">as a child

Hmm but didn't Phil say he met Bronco when he was around Peter's age?",r8fya7
hqh2dsn,"Absolutely #1. I think that’s why the pre-womens rights era setting was critical to the story. She married George as a shrewd, financial choice to ensure her son could go to medical school. Even though she can get by at the restaurant, it would never allow Peter to be a as doctor. He was too badly needed at the restaurant. At that time, she couldn’t pursue a more lucrative job. But then wealthy George enters the picture. She marries him for Peter’s future.

I don’t buy that she loves George. The scene where he tells her she’s amazing in the field after getting married shows this. She looks tolerant, but disinterested - she sacrificed her happiness for her son’s future.",r8fya7
hqheae3,"To me, nothing suggested Peter was a serial killer. Any clues about his father's death are ambiguous at best. His mother is happy with Phil. Phil is not tormenting either of them; he's been good to Rose overall in the context of an early 20th century marriage. He gave her the mansion and the servants that Peter always longed to give Rose. There's no reason to get rid of him.",r8fya7
hqflm4r,"Interesting, I hadn’t considered that Peter had any particular opinion about George",r8fya7
hntwbpp,the sole purpose of the walk was to draw phil's attention. looking at the birds meant nothing from his body language. wow. he needed to ingratiate himself with phil by showing toughness.,r8fya7
hy1szqi,"I definitely read it like Phil suspected he might have seen something he shouldn't and that's why (along with the fact that he saw himself in Peter because of the notion of being soft = gay) he tried to be friendly. But not that he was doing it all to protect the secret or even considering to kill him. 

At that point, Phil thought he had Peter pegged already, he thought he was a soft weak willed boy that probably shared his inclinations (a gay guy in the closet would not give that much information like he did at the end about him and Bronco Henry). His own possible attraction towards the boy was what kept him blind about his nature (even seeing him kill the rabbit in cold blood was not enough. Also, like others pointed, he didn't even consider to ask about where he got those extra strips.)",r8fya7
hs02f8m,It was obvious after he got from the dead animal,r8fya7
hqrcogf,"I think we were led to believe he's shaken by their homophobia, but actually he flinched at other things instead.  

For example when Phil first makes fun of his paper flowers and towel, Peter seems very upset -- but it might be because of the insult to his possessions and routine, rather than the insult to himself.  

Likewise when he flinched in the middle of the guys on horses, it was a natural reaction to an immediate physical threat, not flinching at their homophobia.",r8fya7
hwawj4q,"Definitely. Just like the rabbit, Phil made the mistake of not considering Peter a threat.",r8fya7
hwuk7qj,Ok Phil,r8fya7
i23pod7,"I agree somewhat but ol Pete is getting a hero worship in here. It’s a coward move I agree because he never tries to even tell Phil to chill out on mom. He could’ve done all the same shit and tried communication first before he murders a man. Lotta fucked up with Phil, but he built an empire and sounds like he had a pretty shitty childhood. Tormenting Rose wasn’t cool but certainly not justification for murder. I think many would have the same reservations if our partner/brother married someone out of his league on a whim. She also doesn’t say a damn thing, I get it was a different time and women needed to survive sometimes. In this case, she is literally the queen of the castle and has complete support from George. I get you’re out of place but damn have some dignity. All that said, Pete shocked the shit out of me and I didn’t see it coming.

Rose also went through a lot, like every other character so I can understand why she didn’t. Kirsten Dunst did a great job, loved seeing her and Plemmons on screen together again.",r8fya7

hzaj293,"I agree with most of your comments. However, I think Rose may have some education and knowledge about “society” since she was married to a doctor and supported her son’s desire to be a doctor like his father. Her husband’s death would have been very tough emotionally and also financially. The pressure to provide for her child would have been very challenging. All of those things would understandably make someone vulnerable and fragile at times. She tried to run a “clean” business and didn’t like her diners drinking to excess in her restaurant. She aspired to have a good business that she could be proud of and feel that her son wasn’t exposed to bad people. The only safety net a person had was their family and the generosity of members of the community. Times were completely different back then.",r8fya7

Bear in mind Rose was already dangerously drunk, so he was in a  race against time to rescue her, with no hope of having any influence in a society that saw boys like him as sub-human.",r8fya7
hnb1qg4,I agree with everything you said. I still think that Roses drinking problem shows her as a person that doesn't SOLVE the problems she has. She is afraid of Phil - she drinks. And this running away/not facing reality/not being able to solve problems is what all the parents in the book do and what is being criticized. Put VERY bluntly of course 😅,r8fya7
hncqnug,Which interaction was that? I lost track of some of the names. And what was the book's version of that interaction?,r8fya7
hnfloro,"You guys make me want to read a book! I like the film, but book sounds better.",r8fya7
hnzkxyw,"Well - it's's one of these situations where two things can be true at the same time: Rose is portrayed as a woman who deals with things she doesn't like by ignoring them. And Phil is not a very nice man. He knowingly keeps annoying Rose and his parents as much as he can. Both of them have redeeming qualities but are not really presented as redeemable.
 
I will say that Phil is the more tragic character in the book, because he really is talented but never really has been accepted by anyone but George. Phil has been acting out his whole life and he pretends it's his cowboy ""I don't bathe"" lifestyle that stops him from being accepted by his parents and not him being gay.

It is also quite tragic that Phil almost never meets people who see things the way he sees them (the dog in the mountains). He is very lonely and the book clearly suggests that he would be less lonely in a more academic setting but as stated above - he is very hung up on the cowboy life style.",r8fya7

The dragging on the cigarette Peter offers him was ofc super overt, but there were so many smaller moments, like the stroking of the saddle, the way the saddle's  knob(?) was effectively framed like a penis, the way how Phil just takes out the bull's balls without any gloves (saying you don't need gloves for that, suggesting that touching testicles wasn't something he found weird) or even the way Phil thumps the wooden log into the hole in the ground, while trying to get Peter's attention.",r8fya7

westerns' style includes broad shots of landscape and panoramic views of the country, which makes up a large conveyence of the setting, set and atmosphere of ""the west"".

Personally, the film didn’t make me feel much, as it was pretty dull and monotonous. After a while the tension  just stops mattering because it has been there for such a long time (the law of diminishing return). Nothing feels like an actual climax, not even in the end. And overthinking everything is not enough for a movie to be good. Even Kubrick films, which have been analyzed to death, are good even when you don’t think about them much, cause first and foremost, they make you feel",r8fya7

I commented elsewhere that I thought Phil's rejection of hygiene might serve as a type of protective measure--from temptation and possibly an instincual response to what could have been assault/grooming by Bronco Henry (which Phil interprets as love and bonding).

The whole film shows that Phil is the exact opposite of what he portrays himself to be. Super macho cowboy who hates sissys but underneath he’s a well educated Yale graduate and closet homosexual.

I interpret this the exact same for his racism as well. I think he actually has a fascination with Indians. Notice how he secretly collects native artifacts and places them in a shadow box in his bedroom like a child. Meanwhile the maid says that he’d burn the hide than ever sell it to a native because he deplores them. I think this is all a facade, too.

hnbgiq1,"It's more driving home that he is quite co-dependent and longing for a connection with someone. I never said it gradually reveals that he is gay. It's pretty clear early on given the way he speaks about his mentor/groomer. Again, they weren't trying to be subtle about his homosexuality. It's more about the themes of toxic masculinity and the innate human desire to connect with other people. 

His shift from being completely domineering to becoming more vulnerable with Peter is because he thought he finally found someone who could accept him. He began to shed the veneer of toxic masculinity and open himself up more before Peter murdered him like he did to the rabbit.

Rose was a person who lost her previous husband to suicide, her son was away at university, her husband was borderline incapable of standing up to his brother who was hostile and violent in his manner towards her and on top of that she is surrounded by ranch hands who look up to Phil and a couple of maids who cease talking whilst she is around. And you wonder why she starts drinking over a period of months (I imagine there is plenty that goes on in the time between her arriving and her son getting back from medical school that we don't see). You talk about being more subtle yet you don't seem to empathise with her and ask for more handholding with regards to the characters. I will concede that she probably could have used more fleshing out but on the other hand, the fact that she was so powerless and lacked agency is a testament to the crushing effects that toxic masculinity can have on women as well.

As for the hides it's pretty obvious that he wants to use them to finish the rope for Peter. Also it probably isn't a stretch for a misogynistic asshole like him to be racist as well. Rose was continuing to buckle under the pressure so in a moment of defiance (and utter drunkenness) gave away the hides.",r8fya7

i78xqyd,"Being as big of a fan of the book as I am, I do agree that Phil's cruelty being played down affected things... 

Still I disagree on Rose having less depth, she just has less *plot*. I don't know if my rationale will make sense to anyone but I get where you're coming from. I felt similarly to you & was dissatisfied on the first watch because I was so attached to book Rose and I wanted to see the *same* character. She's not the same character, but intellectually & emotionally somehow it really, really worked for me because it focused in on certain aspects of her far more. Dunst played this incredible angle on how environment+class+Phil can defeat her sense of self-worth so completely. I think she definitely came across as a very sensible and capable woman in the first act, 100%, even a gesture of making George do a dance and taking charge there suddenly sticks out when I rewatch it because she's basically totally frozen in fear (more for Peter than herself) throughout. Also, I do feel like: yeah even incredibly strong people can and do crumble when they're transplanted into a completely different landscape? The stakes are so damn high (bc it's obvious Phil wants her OUT, and her son's education is at stake, she sold everything she had). She's totally stranded and abandoned by everyone around her (even her son tbh!) So in that situation, especially if someone is there undermining your confidence... yeah you can become a totally different person! Obviously this is not the same but I can 100% relate. I made a professional change requiring a move to a very white place and honestly nobody who knows me would believe how under confident, quiet and pushover-y I became so immediately as one of the only people of color in the new environment. Anyway, that's why I feel like Rose actually is the REAL character who comes out most fully for me, even in the film somehow. Yes, I give much more credit to the performance than the writing, but it feels clear to me that the writing also honed in on very particular angles of the Rose from the book: mostly her kindness & softness which literally never wavers. In the book, Rose takes up half the book but we're sitting in her isolation while the men get to be out there doing stuff (the ""plot"") and it's brilliant characterization but because even the best of people have some awful thoughts, she's a lot more...pathetic, even though she knows it.

Regarding Peter—I mean, like, yeah I get what you're saying but I feel like that's the a *more plot* \> l*ess plot* bias. I always knew Peter and Phil would get the most attention because how the strict *plot* unfolds does only involve them, but Rose is all passivity and quietness. I don't know if this is satisfactory but for me, just because one character does fewer things than another means they're a plot device. If anything, it makes everything we do see even more important. For every gesture and pLoT twIStY stuff to scrutinize Peter's words or body language over, I think Rose has 10 times more with every micro expression and it all feels important to informing us about her. Like when Peter tells her she's beautiful there's this immediate wtf reaction face because she finds it a little inappropriate and even her son is reducing her to ""beauty"". Honestly I think *Peter* lacks depth. Peter is just too much of a plot *driver*. A lotta people seem to get this idea that he's actually well-intentioned or ""good"" in some way but the book is very much the progression of a Norman Bates-like villain. He's cold & incredibly intelligent, but that's... kind of it for me. Carefully shown breadcrumb trail to a calculating murder but not much characterization. For example, even though I like this choice actually, Campion also removed the explicit confirmation that he actually *is* queer. In the book even though we obviously don't know he's a murderer in disguise, we know how he feels about everyone very very very clearly. I didn't for a minute think there was any genuineness to him around Phil or felt anything but pure hatred. :/",r8fya7
hsn01yk,"Maybe not worthy of death, but he’s deliberately terrorizing his brother’s family. Phil is almost certainly a victim of abuse, but he’s also a piece of shit abuser in his own right.",r8fya7
hyp23jm,Exactly.,r8fya7
hn9sdmr,"He called her a cheap gold digger to her face and told her he wasn’t her brother. Drove her to tears on their first interaction and relentlessly made fun of her son. Demeans her husband on regular basis and essentially ruins her day every time he interacts with her. He was an overbearing negative presence in their lives. 

Strained relationships don’t need a lot of face to face time to drive someone into depression and drinking. Just over the holidays many folks are stressed from in laws and blood relatives. Imagine having one give you shit every time they see you everyday.",r8fya7

In the book she does have this ""omg he's the son of a *chief*???"" response in that she thinks that's super awesome/worthy of respect. Doesn't get much more than that. I like that Edward Nappo gets his own POV in the book tho (the book shifts through a million POVs but mostly Phil & Rose. Rose is as much of a protagonist in the book as Phil). And he sees her as this tiny, pathetic but well-intentioned woman & it's kinda cool how he sizes her up immediately. Mostly it's just cool that we get to see his perspective at all!",r8fya7
hq5zxa2,"Phil didn’t deserve to die, never said he did. Peter’s response is extreme but understandable, especially due to his lower levels of empathy (My generous interpretation). The film’s ending left a hole in the pit of my stomach because there is no catharsis. Yes, Phil was a damaged and cruel individual who’s general vile behaviour directly negatively impacted his brother and Peter’s mother but in the process of Peter manipulating Phil, we realise he may be capable of change and Phil isn’t some monster but a complex, damaged individual likely groomed and abused by Bronco Bill which he is in denial of. Phil takes Peter under his wing initially to further bully his mother but slowly forms what he believes to be a legitimate bond with him and reveals a vulnerable side we didn’t think existed. Phil is right to be angry about the fur’s being gifted away without his permission and crucially, he never molests Peter even-though he could have done so, especially in the barn where Peter is trying to seduce him. He’s too focused on finishing the rope which exposes his sentimentality and humanity ironically becoming the vehicle for his death. What Phil needed in a modern context was his brother to stand up to him, a good kick in the teeth and psychiatric help, but this is a ranch in the early 20th century. At best we have a long and winding road to recovery if Peter considered pursuing reform through an authentic relationship (His mother would continue to be subjected to emotional torment for a while considering Phil’s understandable but over the top reaction to the furs) and Peter has psychopathic tendencies or is indeed a full blown Bateman, so there was never a real chance he’d consider reforming Phil to begin with.

As I said, Peter’s behaviour is relatable, many would consider violence in that position but whether they’d have the capability to pull the trigger and meticulously plot a murder scheme for months on end is another thing entirely. In the 21st century, the road to recovery for a man like Phil would still be treacherous and take years. In that ranch, I’m not sure Phil could’ve ever been fully reformed or more likely, it would’ve been too late by the time he truly changes (e.g. pushes the mother into alcohol related death). 

However, in both the film and the theoretical scenario of this occurring in a period with modern moral sensibilities and recovery opportunities, the right choice would’ve always been to stand-up to Phil and try to lead him down a brighter path (It’s left open ended in the film whether it would work). 

That’s my interpretation of the movie version at least.

Phil appears on the surface to be much like a feral dog lashing out at those around him indiscriminately whom Peter seeks to put down but as we learn more about Phil’s personal life we realise he isn’t quite as wild and aggressive as we think he is by nature. Peter superficially presents himself as a meek, submissive house pet but is revealed to be a cunning wolf trapping his prey. Can all wild animals be made civil? Probably not. Does this mean we shouldn’t at least attempt it if we can limit risk to ourselves and others?  Of course not, human beings are not inherently evil or violent, even people like Phil deserve a shot at redemption.

So no, Phil didn’t deserve to die but I appreciate why Peter felt like he had to kill him.",r8fya7

hnd6sbv,"No, actually. The book was clear that her doctor husband was a failure, in that he made no money at all because he served poor clients who randomly paid him with goods.  It was only the boarding house they owned together that allowed them to pay the mortgage. Rose and Peter were the ones who supported that family (running the boarding house- Johnny was off doctoring and drinking) and they supported it after Johnny died.

He was a kind man, but he drank even before he met Rose. And, he was too kind and didn't earn a living even then. The town of Beech broke him completely. Phil was the final straw, but he still didn't kill himself for a  YEAR after his confrontation in the bar with Phil, which Johnny actually started.

Rose was working playing the piano in a silent movie cinema when Johnny first met her. She lived at home with her parents and they were not described as well off.

hnn2nn4,"Respectfully, I disagree and that's okay. If whistling at someone / in your own home and calling them out when they say they've 'played for hours in the cinema pits' is grounds for harassment I encourage you to 'toughen up'. I will agree that it was pretty harsh how he went about that scene. I kinda blame George a little bit for putting her in that situation altogether. However, think Rose is ultimately responsible for her own happiness and well-being. She and George should have had a conversation with Phil about what was going on. What you see as malice I see as a broken hurt man just communicating ineffectively. I did not witness him actively, deliberately scheming to physically destroy someone's life. Remember, Rose was the one who decided not to play, he only empathized it, albeit harshly. If talking candidly at a late-night party is going to destroy someone's life, which is an extreme reach, how fragile is Rose's mental state? You paint Rose as a delicate little snowflake that was victimized and lived under some rule of tyranny and terror. I see someone that was isolated from her world, couldn't adapt properly and used ineffective coping mechanisms to 'resolve' her problem. I don't think George's and Rose's decision to move and isolate her with barely any family or friends into that environment was good for her. But she made that decision knowing his brother was an asshole, she made the decision to not confront anyone, she made the decision to drink to cope, she made the decision to sell off Phil's property. Honestly, Rose's character came across as kinda contrived. I was like how can a former hotel owner living in that time, also a single mother, be this soft? She really seemed to play as a foil to paint to the audience Phil as some dastardly villain making us want to side with her son, the murderer. Anyways, I apologize if any of this is bringing up any past trauma for you. That must have sucked being or witnessing someone in a similar situation as the movie portrays. I appreciate your input and value the discussion. I can see where you're coming from.

Edit: Talked to my partner about this and she actually viewed Rose as mentally unsound, that Phil was her 'trigger', and had an irrational fear response towards him. Hence the coping mechanism of excessive drinking.",r8fya7

hnaonrt,"Also: it's not JUST about Phil obviously. She's also working-class and entering a rich world where she's alone and alienated. She's ignored and disregarded at the dinner by rich folks who think she's ""got George halter-trained"". It's not just Phil, it's who she already is (she's actually fairly well put together, stable, good before she comes to the ranch). She just wasn't prepared for this level of immediate hostility; she *might* have navigated changing the family's perception of her as a gold-digger over time, if only Phil wasn't gaslighting her constantly.

Dunst was brilliant imo, she really sold it. I *kinda* get the criticism because Phil is not as mean & evil as he was in the book, so it made her task harder but I think she nailed it. I don't read the end of the dinner scene as her suddenly being ""terrorized"" by Phil, I read it more as... after her humiliation, the way he swooped in made her lapse into nervousness & insecurity because it felt like a *barrage* out of nowhere, after a failure to be enough of a trophy wife for George at the dinner.

> whoa you opened my eyes on a possible assault. in the cattle drive scene, phil suggests him and george go elk hunting like they used to with henry. the look on george's face makes me think george was also assaulted by henry on the elk hunting trips

Fabulous catch. It was itching at my brain, how George could become so distant from his primary companion of 25 years. And the divergent paths seemed to be more than George chooses civility and female companionship. I picked up on George's distinct lack of Henry-hero worship, but didn't make a connection. 

I would posit that even if George wasn't assaulted, he saw a change in his brother and knows Henry was instrumental. Phil's incredibly devastating self isolation and self hatred turn him into his abuser, at least in affect and manner if not in actions. I never doubted that George loved Phil, but he seems so disdainful it really perplexed me in some ways.

I do believe the river bathing spot was significant. I took it as Henry and Phil's little love nest. Note how later in the film Phil avoids the area all the other hands are bathing.

ht9ini0,"This is an excellent point that completely passed me by. Having reflected upon it, George trying not to drink with the cowhands and Phil before heading to Rose's feels like a deliberate move on his part almost as though he knew she didn't like drinking. We know there's already some tension between the brothers because George is dressing smarted and Phil makes a reference to him coming back hitched. We also know the brothers know a bit about Rose and her situation because Phil writes to the old lady calling Rose a suicide widow before he even knows George has married her. 

The fact that George will drink in the company of the governer and his wife tells me that they're old money or at least very secure because they're all happily flaunting the law in each others company and the old lady refusing it might simply suggest that she agrees as many did at the time that alcohol was the devil's drink although I've no doubt I'm missing something there.

We don't get a clear indication I don't think of when Rose's husband died but it had been 9 years since prohibition started in Montana so it's possible he died before then but more likely both Rose and her husband drank, him to the extreme. She blamed the drink as an external force responsible for her husbands death and kept it at arms length and then succumbed to temptation when overwhelmed by her situation with Phil. I did find Peter's reaction to the bottle under the pillow very interesting though. I immediately saw it as the reaction of a son who was aware of his mother's demons and who'd rather keep them hidden to protect her than to shame her. It didn't feel like the first time he'd covered her tracks.

There's a lot to unpack in this film and in that sense I enjoyed it immensely.",r8fya7

hta4gxv,"His definitive role is as Ira Hayes in Flags of Our Fathers; the movie absolutely belongs to him. After that there's a number of poor movies that he's good in.

Windtalkers is okay, so he's easily the best thing in that too. The issue with Adam Beach is that he came into his prime before young native actors were being given every role they were due, and in a time when notable roles meant for them were still overwhelmingly being rewritten (or covertly brown-faced) for white stars instead.

When I say 'actor of his generation' I mean that in a just world he ought to be considered one.

Outside of his two WWII roles he's largely found good work in TV, particularly the Leaphorn & Chee TV movies with Wes Studi, and solid but too-small supporting roles in westerns, the best of those being Hostiles and I Buried My Heart at Wounded Knee.

He's got an okay role in Cowboys and Aliens, but he's largely just a fart-catcher to Harrison Ford's Cattle Baron.

His one true starring role in a cinema release was Squanto: A Warrior's Tale, but that's cheesy Disney revisionist trash, and he was too young and inexperienced to be effective in the role.

My massive, compounded disappointment at going to see Suicide Squad largely based on my love of him, David Harbour, and Viola Davis, was immeasurable.",r8fya7

Phil is not and he knew something was off when he wrote the letter saying she was suicidal widow with her half cooked son.

George's mom gives her rings at the funeral and she is so happy everything is going according to plan.

hpjajo7,">I do believe the river bathing spot was significant. I took it as Henry and Phil's little love nest. Note how later in the film Phil avoids the area all the other hands are bathing. I think he is avoiding exposing himself to desire.

The swimming hole summed up Phil's isolation in three ways:

1. His desire to be a ""Man in Nature"" in an almost Romantic sense. He doesn't want to be in ""civilization"" wearing suits and driving cars; he wants to be on a horse or hunting or exploring. He and George seem to have always differed in this regard but George's marriage to Rose, a woman ""from town"" who seems to be pulling his brother away (with the introduction of things like the grand piano and the dinner party for the governor, even though those were George's doing, not Rose's) is making the rift irreparable and part of the reason he's so set on destroying her.

2. The isolation and loneliness that can come with being a gay man. Phil doesn't live in a time or place where he can pursue the kind of love he wants. Pure chance brought Bronco Henry into his life and bad luck took him out of it. Phil can't hit up Grindr or Hinge; he lives in the middle of nowhere and the odds of him finding another man who would even openly confess to sharing his ""preferences"" let alone also be an emotional match are basically zilch, to say nothing of the fact that such a relationship would have to be as covert as whatever he had going on with Bronco Henry.
Phil gets left out of a lot of the camaraderie the ranch hands who work for him seem to have with one another. When they're singing songs at the bar and dancing with the local hookers, Phil quietly excuses himself and goes upstairs to his room, poking his head in and out of doors in search of George—his fraternal relationship fills the space where a romantic relationship with a woman and/or platonic relationships with other men would be. When they're all bathing in the river, engaging in horseplay and the equivalent of locker room towel slaps, Phil knows he can't be part of that. No matter how much he ridicules and torments Peter and any other ""weak"" man he encounters, Phil will never get to just be ""one of the guys.""

3. Phil's secret place is sort of like his own Neverland. His secret hideaway where he keeps otherwise mundane things that are significant to him (like Bronco Henry's personal effects) is like a treehouse or a fort a kid would have. The book touches more on Phil's childlike qualities that coexist with his embittered, cynical facade: at one point, he gets down on the ground and plays marbles with the son of a man who's haggling with George over a business deal. He collects things like arrowheads and rocks and proudly displays them in the same bedroom he has slept in since he was a boy. When George brings Rose home and the two consummate their marriage in the master bedroom his parents once occupied, we see Phil, alone in the dark, sitting on his twin bed, the bed next to him where his brother once slept now empty. To the extent that ""growing up"" is about marriage and children, or just about pursuing romantic or sexual relationships in socially acceptable ways, Phil can't do that. He's permanently stuck in childhood.",r8fya7
hy9eczt,"Watched it last night. I was wondering .. I was confused for a while with this film, because it seemed to me Phil and George
were staying in a hotel or something.
It wasn't until I'd watched quite a bit, as well as a glance at Wikipedia, that I realised the pair were in fact 'wealthy ranch owners'.
Phil didn't seem at home in the house, it was almost as if he was going to bed in servant's quarters or something.
But .. why does George get into bed with him, to go to sleep?
(Staying on top of the covers)
As owners of a large, servanted house, there's surely no need to do this?
So ..I was wondering, did Phil and George have an established incestuous relationship?
At several points near the start of the film, Phil tries to connect with George but George is always pulling away.
George wants to leave something behind - he goes to Rose, marries her.
Phil can't stand this!
Could be wrong, would have to watch again.
I also didn't get why the parents were so distant to the pair, they almost seemed like strangers and clearly had a home elsewhere, I maybe missed something here.
It's a clever film.",r8fya7

hqra084,"Exactly this.  We forget their very first time together when she watches George serving the guests at the restaurant.  The way her face lights up at his personality seems very genuine.  Also, the reason why she hardly smiles around George is because she's constantly dreading Phil.",r8fya7
hrrz8jm,"There is also a whole heap of power play going on immediately after the walk to the birds. 
Peter is playing naive to Phil by calling him Sir over and over until he finally drops to a knee, removes his hat and calls Phil by his name. His sign of false ‘submission’. He’s weaving Phil into his trap just like that rabbit earlier and the one to follow. 

The earlier stories of Peters relationship at school with a friend who calls him doctor and who he calls professor also suggests some sexual power play that he is clearly not naive to.

The movie often plays with power dynamics and a quick glance would suggest that Phil holds it but there are layers to these power structures and they shift constantly.",r8fya7
ho3qp9p,"Nope, not trolling. Within the world of POTD, Peter destroyed his mother's tormentor and ensured he'd never trouble her again. She’s never have to think the sound of whistling or a banjo meant that Phil found his way back into her life.

hnvmtyd,"I agree completely hat gender norms are very difficult to appreciate completely.

I think Rose has an additional issue (not only the gender roles): She is not rich/from an old rich family.

It is interesting that in the book  there are women described as capable and by no means less strong og influential than their husbands. Those women are the Governor's wife,  who is witty, charming and very rich, and Phil's and George's mother who also is presented as an equal to her husband. Both these women are very rich.",r8fya7
hnljnjj,"I read those scenes a little differently. Peter's sympathy is genuine, he just knows these animals need to be put down (for dinner, because their injured, or to further his medical education) but he doesn't see the need to be cruel about it. It's a direct contrast with Phil who is unnecessarily brutal with animals. He whips his horse to release anger, he rips off a bulls testicles, etc.  

I think this is clearest in his last scene with Phil. As a gay man he understands Phil pretty well and sees that Phil is genuinely starting to care for him. So his act of kindness is to give him a taste of what he's missed since Bronco died, that's affection from another man (with a good dose of sexual tension).

Don't get me wrong, I do also think these things are calculated to put Peter's victims at ease, but I don't think he's cold. You see the next morning after Peter gives Phil the infected hides that he hadn't slept and has been crying. I think there is some genuine remorse in having to kill Phil but like the other animals Peter sees his death is necessary if his mother is going to survive.",r8fya7
ht9g3rj,You're not wrong there! Look to the shootout in the 3:10 to Yuma remake which is neither boring in content nor as a clichéd narrative device. It's earned through story progression and character development as you say and when used correctly it's a payoff not a crutch. This was not a film that had earned or had any interest in trying to earn such a scene. I wouldn't call this film boring because I thought the tension was palpable throughout the last third but it was definitely a slow burn and I'm not sure I'd watch it again.,r8fya7

hoqf52a,I agree with this. I thought her motivation seems a bit off. Her reaction to Phil seemed totally overboard.,r8fya7
hq7pckv,"Not invalidating your interpretation but I took it completely the opposite way. The whole ending sequence of Phil’s sickness, abrupt death, funeral and murder reveal framed the cathartic resolution for the characters abused by him in a sense of unease and shock for the audience (I know many were expecting the twist but I was so immersed by the cinematography and acting quality, I lost myself in the moment of the narrative).

Phil is suddenly sick, he seems to be ok enough to recover on first glance but then quickly dies off screen. If we were supposed to take pleasure in Phil’s death, why would the director cut away from the moment he ceases to be a nuisance but not the pain he suffered in the build up to his demise? We see Phil suffer but no one mourns for him, we cut from pain to a corpse. His parents almost seem revealed he’s gone as to no longer burden themselves with a closeted gay son who may have hurt their social standing. His brother uses Phil’s death an an opportunity to invite his parents to a family gathering. Peter’s parents are finally happy as they deserved to be but we see this happiness through Peter’s eyes (His window) which in turn, invokes a smile in Peter. Peter is smiling as the result of killing a damaged, closeted man whom nobody loved and the only man who did was likely his abuser. Phil brought a lot of resentment on himself but Peter’s smile isn’t victory, it’s perverse. It makes you worried for his step-father, anyone who crosses or hurts his mother in the future intentionally or not. He’s learnt killing those who hurt his mother brings her happiness and therefore derives a sense of accomplishment from it.

A man is dead, no one mourns him and the one who killed him is actually pleased about it.

Peter smiles at you but you know deep down, eventhough you appreciate why he did what he did, something isn’t quite right, the air is poisoned.

It many ways, it’s a critique and dissection of revenge westerns. Peter may be guided by righteous fury but his actions are simply a continuation of the cycle of violence, maybe even worse than Phil’s. Besides the fact Phil never killed anyone (In the book it’s a bit more complex), Peter is far more terrifying than Phil ever was, psychopath or not. Peter is a zealot, he just happened to kill an unlikeable man this time. The righteous, intelligent man with an unimpeachable inner moral compass is usually the hero, Peter should be the hero but as it’s hinted at towards the end and with that smirk, when a hero adopts a subjective inflexible doctrine, he’s not really a hero at all, it just so happens his desires aligned with the audience and with what consensus morality would say is rightish. Peter is an indifferent force of nature, only activated by “protecting his mother”, he is capable of absolute evil. Ironically, Phil’s actions are what makes him the villain but at heart, there is a chance he could’ve been a good man but Peter has made it impossible now. 

Why hurt someone else when you might be able to help them? 

But yeah, it’s completely subjective after all. I just don’t think it aligns with the themes of the rest of the film.",r8fya7

I will let you sit with that kind of horror - watching your secret lover die when you are 20 years old and not being able to outwardly mourn him as a lover.

Phil pushed Johnny Gordon to suicide. Johnny was a drunk doctor and a failure at life, but a genuinely nice-ish guy. He knew he was a failure and that is why he started drinking. One night, he encounters Phil at the bar and makes fun of Phil for being an uneducated hick. Phil retaliates by speaking to him in greek and humiliating him. He may have shoved him against the wall, too, but Johnny was not an innocent here.

This is the breaking point for Johnny and he kills himself a few months later. Phil didn't put his head in a noose. Johnny was depressed and an alcoholic and took his own life.  


ETA: Everyone who says Phil is despicable is missing the point. He totally is, but it is because of pain.

I think Peter did everything he did to put Phil at ease (as you say), but never intended to give him an easy death and that his tears and angst were that he was afraid either Phil would survive or that someone would figure it out. Notice that he made damn sure to not let Phil handle the cigarette - that served two purposes: it put Phil at ease and ensured that the cigarette did not get contaminated with anthrax from Phil's dirty hands handling it.

The rabbit was injured, so phil wanted peter to put it out of its misery. that is what peter did to phil.

hotcu98,"My man, movies are not real life. The point of art is to explore places we can't go IRL.

This film is consistent with Jane Campion's specific point of view and the themes in her films of a power originating in what's conventionally thought of as the feminine meeting and winning over toxic masculinity. 

It doesn't really matter whether Peter is a psychopath or not bc his one motive for killing Phil is to save Rose. We go into the showdown wondering who will win: the swaggering alpha bully head cowboy or the ""delicate"" boy who makes paper flowers. 

SPOILERS:
Walter White is not a psychopath, despite his considerable kill count.

The Bride in the Kill Bill films kills a lot of ppl in her vengeance quest - this does not make her a psychopath.

hnbeezo,"In the book, Phil decided during the thresher camp scene that he would take Peter under his wing and make a man of him, which would turn Peter against Rose and contribute to her downfall.  He wanted to mentor him like Bronco Henry mentored Phil. But, Phil is so repressed and still in love with Bronco Henry that he doesn't think of the boy as a sexual partner, but a friend. So, he planned to teach him to braid, to ride, to rope.  


The moment that Phil started thinking of Peter as a potential lover is when Peter told Phil that he was good (this part made Phil really emotional in the book) and that Peter had hides (Peter explains in the book that he wanted to be like Phil, which is why he has a hide). It was the fact that Peter actually **touched** Phil. No one touches Phil. Not his brother, not the ranch hands - no one. And, he hasn't been touched since Bronco Henry died. So, when Peter touched Phil's arm, Phil fell for it.  


Everyone sees Phil as grooming Peter. But, it really wasn't sexual until that moment. Phil was far too repressed and was hiding his sexuality for far too long to just admit to himself or anyone that he wanted the boy in any way other than as a way to manipulate Rose.   


The hardest thing about this movie is remembering that we are viewing a 1960s book taking place in the 1920s through a 2021 lens. No one would have thought of it as grooming way back then and girls were still getting married at 15, so it wasn't considered gross to have an older person and a younger person together. The age wasn't the problem - the homosexuality was.",r8fya7

I would also add that this was *also* a revenge killing and that Peter would have known, because he consulted his textbooks, that a death by anthrax was neither fast, nor merciful. It would be drawn out - they even stated that the seizures at the end were truly terrifying. That isn't merciful. That is torture.  


Just like a death by alcohol poisoning is slow and awful. So is death by anthrax when it gives you meningitis. He wanted for Phil what his mother's death would be if he (Peter) didn't intervene.",r8fya7

In the post above you said “I don’t know why Peter’s the “monster” just because he kills to save his mom.” My answer was to that question - Peter is undoubtably a monster because he coldly seduced and then infected with anthrax someone for being mean to his mother. That act is not justified within the film. That doesn’t mean I can’t enjoy the movie and the power struggle between Peter’s effeminacy and Phil’s masculinity.",r8fya7
hsne74x,">My man, movies are not real life. The point of art is to explore places we can't go IRL.

I think the amount of dysfunctional families out there that don't speak to one another, especially when it comes to different forms of abuse is such an astronomical number. While your statement may be true in some regard, like science fiction as one example, it's really not a statement to be made about this film because the themes can drive pretty close to home. It's like would someone in your family kill for your family or not. 

As Peter was physically weaker, he found his method to kill Phil. Now I'm not saying Peter is definitely a psychopath because just because we haven't seen him show remorse doesn't mean he doesn't have it. 

I said 'psycopathy' meaning his tendencies seemed psychopathic. But besides this debate of psychopath or not. Peter is still more in the wrong than Phil for acting on killing. And I hope you are not disagreeing on that fact.",r8fya7
hsnipr1,"This theme has been coming from government and lawyers influencing media in many ways. It's very black and white what we should do with someone when they murder someone. But it's the reasoning behind it always that decides their longevity and fate in prison. Creating that blueprint on killing, murder or 'death by fault of a person' is important. Since the beginning of humanity we've been doing this, and it was much darker the way we did it in the past, and with time we've been expanding the gray area of this very black and white sanctioning. 

It would've been a much better film if Peter didn't have psychopathic tendencies and killed Phil really because he believed killing him was the only way to stop the torment. Imagine how different this story would be if she herself killed Phil, her tormentor, and how different this story would be. She would definitely go to prison at that time, but we would give sympathy, and quite realistically in today's justice system she wouldn't go to prison. 

Now if a persons' sentence is lessened or deemed innocent when they kill their tormentor. Let's throw a son into that situation who wants to protect his mother who can't help herself. He very much would get the same sentence as if his mother did the killing. Now lets make the boy an actual psychopath. The sentence should not be any less don't you agree?

Now that's an interesting film. I think the biggest fail of this film is showing Phil as an actual tormentor.",r8fya7
hq1075s,"Again, I'm saying the term refers to more than setting.",r8fya7
hnv79kk,"I think this is a valid interpretation. But I felt that while Peter was plotting away, and had considered anthrax poisoning some time before the hide offerings, that the actual moment was one of desperation for Peter. 

In that moment, he knows he can't change Phil's mind, ever. That Phil will hate his mother even more and that it will escalate. At that point, it could be argues that Peter is defending his mother in the best possible way he can come up with. It's a bit of a Hail Mary, or his last choice.

i29jp43,"I don't think the suicide made him indifferent to death.

Someone else in the comments made a great observation that the sound of Pete running his finger through the comb sounds exactly  like the creaking of a taut rope.

He was the one who found his father hanging. We never see him making that sound until he learns his mom has started drinking.

It's an audio and visual cue that the suicide and the alcoholism leading up to the suicide is very heavy on his mind the moment he sees his mom drinking.

My read is that he really didn't want history to repeat itself with Rose.

What really cinches it are the tears in his eyes when his mom asks him what noise makes him shiver. And he immediately makes the comb creaking noise again looking very upset. We can interpret it as just  tears seeing his mom like this, but narratively, the framing, says to me that what he does with the comb immediately after the question is the answer.

Though he was hiding it, I think he was quite affected by his father's death, and terrified his mom was going to do the same thing.

And after that scene, I think the comb sound also becomes a tell for whenever Peter is preoccupied with the thoughts of premeditated murder and death. If I remember right we always hear and see him make that noise when it has something to do with his plan.",r8fya7

hsxnukw,"I don't think Peter is more in the wrong than Phil at all, nor is the film guiding us to that conclusion.

Phil is not written to be a sympathetic character. Even when we learn the reason for him being the way he is, in order to sympathize with him, we would need to justify the nearly lifelong torment he dumps on Rose for no other reason except that the guy has unresolved issues. We would have to be on board with sadistic cruelty.

Toxic masculinity is the reason Phil has to repress his sexuality, it's how he justifies his abhorrent treatment of Rose and Peter, how the other ranch hands and even Rose's husband justify it, and it's the reason Bronco had to repress his sexuality, too, to the point of *maybe* assaulting Phil as a young man. So while Phil is a victim of toxic masculinity, he's also its avatar and perpetuator of its legacy. 

The film is very clear that toxic masculinity sucks because the tenderest moments of the film happen between Rose and Peter when they manage to get time away from ""the boys."" We enter the film with a shot of paper flowers, meticulously crafted by the son, lovingly laid out on the tables by the mother -- and watch as a bunch of asshole cowboys shit all over that little bit of heaven.

We understand that the only reason Peter kills Phil is to save Rose. 

The morality of that decision is a lot more ambiguous than a ""thou shalt not kill"" social contract, and therefore much more interesting.

Serious question: do you all deem John Wick films to be totally unwatchable? Bc that guy has killed 299 people.",r8fya7
hsnu80k,"She would definitely go to prison in today’s justice system. Self-defense is the only valid reason for murdering someone and it is notoriously hard to prove. Basically ones life MUST be in danger AND it must be clear that the murderer had no other choice but to kill his/her assailant. 

Killing someone for being mean to you does not meet any conditions of self-defense and is virtually a guarantee of prison time. Killing in such an elaborate way that Peter killed Phil would pretty much guarantee a first-degree murder charge and would likely lead to life in prison with no parole.

Anyway, I love this film and I think people are completely misinterpreting it. The film doesn’t justify anything Peter does - both him and Phil represent two distinct versions of masculinity. Peter is outwardly bookish, feminine and completely rejects any accepted masculine traits. Phil is outwardly physical, rough and exudes the accepted masculine traits of his time/place. However, on the inside Phil is tender and romantic - he’s a damaged boy pining for a lover. Peter, on the other hand, is ruthless, manipulative and incapable of love. Their demeanors do not match their outward presentation. Phil is no match for Peter no matter how many bull testicles he shears off.

This contrast is exactly what the film is about. It’s not about right or wrong. The fact that Peter murders Phil doesn’t really effectively deal with his mothers alcoholism. It is a small respite at best. She has her own problems - self-consciousness, depression, trauma - which must be dealt with in order to cure her addiction. What happens if she succumbs to the bottle again? Will Peter kill her husband? We don’t know but we should definitely know that Peter’s murder of Phil was an insane overreaction to the predicament his mother faces. He is capable of anything.",r8fya7
