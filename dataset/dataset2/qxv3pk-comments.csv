hlcw2zd,"Jon Bernthal is slowly becoming one of my favorite actors. Absolute chameleon, the guy disappears into any role he's given. Bill Simmons said he's his #1 'supporting actor' that he's very bullish about for the future, and I 100% agree. I'm buying all the Bernthal stock.",qxv3pk
hlcnma4,"I thought this was a really sweet movie. Definitely a love letter to their father. I didn't know much about the William sisters background before but I was invested the whole time. The actresses they got for the girls in the family were great. Very charming cast all around. I am a sucker for a good sports biopic and I think this was definitely a good one. The music was great too. Definitely worth a watch if you like a good sports movie and wanna kill a few hours.

Also when he left the girls at the store when they were bragging was so unexpected and hilarious. ""They can brag about walking 3 miles."" Drove right off. I laughed pretty loud at that.",qxv3pk

hldi4sb,"I think it's awesome that Will Smith gave the other actors bonuses from his $40 million salary for this film after it was announced that it'd stream on HBO Max at the same time as in the theaters.  He understood that the film was going to suffer in the box office ""bonuses"" actors get from the box office.",qxv3pk
hlhsz88,"This movie had good acting, but the protagonist was difficult to cheer for.

Here we have a father of two potential tennis prodigies, who could not afford a decent tennis coach. He then walks all over coaches who offer help, while placing huge bets on his daughter's success at the expense of the coach. 

Serena and Venus were extremely fortunate they had each other to practice with. If it was just one of them, playing on the level of marketability would have been improbable.

I get the point was to show the heart of a badass father, but I can't help but wonder off all the bad things that had happened in the shadows for this to work.",qxv3pk

hlcuz0z,"I really enjoyed this. Best Will Smith performance I‚Äôve seen in years and really enjoyed the actress who played Venus. As a fan of Venus and Serena, the shot of them with beaded braids was so satisfying.

hlvah9t,This movie really made a man who abandoned the majority of his kids look like a decent father. I don‚Äôt understand everyone in this thread saying how great this movie was. Richard took advantage of everyone in his life and was incredibly stubborn and egotistical and yet I think the movie wanted the audience to root for him. I‚Äôm so confused as to how they tried to disneyfied such an asshole of a human being.,qxv3pk
hlcc66j,Will Smith was a lot more subtle and natural in this than his other Oscar type movie performances. I could see him getting nominated. I also thought Aunjanue Ellis was excellent and deserves some accolades.,qxv3pk
hltwqp0,"I‚Äôm surprised no one else has mentioned Richard Williams‚Äô other family‚Ä¶you know, the mother and six children age 8 and under he abandoned from his first marriage. He allegedly told his oldest daughter he was going out to get her a bike, and never returned. That family lived in poverty thereafter. Serena and Venus came from his second marriage.
Kinda hard to reconcile the image portrayed of him in King Richard with a man who could abandon his children like that.",qxv3pk

hlc73ba,"As someone who grew up watching tennis, I thought this was pretty great. Always figured that Richard Williams is a little larger than life and I thought they portrayed a complex figure really well (and in a way his family agrees with).

Wish there was more awards hype for Jon Bernthal, I thought he was fantastic and played nicely against-type.",qxv3pk
hluc78f,"I think it was a really good movie. Really enjoyed it. 

But I gotta say, after reading about the guy, how the hell can they choose to make a movie about him being a good, dedicated father when the scumbag abandoned 5 of his other first kids???? Looks like he was a good father to Serena and Venus (hence the movie), but if you abandon FIVE of your first kids, by no means can you ever be regarded as a good father let alone have a movie named after you portraying your fatherly figure as positive. 

Even Serena and Venus being onboard for this doesn‚Äôt make sense when you account for his behavior towards his other kids. 

Just read this article featuring his eldest daughter.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.the-sun.com/news/229940/serena-williams-half-sister-dad-left-mom-six-kids/amp/

As a movie, 4/5, cause I felt they should have showed a little bit more of Serena Williams‚Äô path forwards becoming the best ever, as they focused more on Venus‚Äô path (probably cause she was older). 

You finish thinking, oh this was a good guy, wanting the best for his kids, made sure they enjoyed their childhood too without pushing them too much. But nope after reading he abandoned his other 5 kids (supposedly has a bunch of other kids he‚Äôs probably never paid child support to), as a father the guys a scumbag.",qxv3pk

hld9z2a,"I loved it, but that generic fart box sound that Will Smith‚Äôs character let out during his meeting with the agents was by far the weakest moment of the movie for me.",qxv3pk
hlccnt0,"I think this edges out Pursuit of Happyness as Smith‚Äôs best role. I forgot it was Smith on screen at times which says a lot because he‚Äôs one of those actors that I consider to be hard to not see the actor instead of the character. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he gets an oscar nomination since they love movies like this. The supporting cast was also great. Bernthal‚Äôs performance was fun and got a lot of laughs out of the audience. The kitchen argument scene with the wife was a standout scene to me. Such good performances from both actors.

One thing I don‚Äôt get; why did the oldest daughter not come to Florida? Did she just attend college back in Compton?",qxv3pk
hlctgav,"I loved the movie. But I finished with mixed emotions. 

My dad displayed ‚ÄúKing Richard‚Äù tendencies when I was growing up. I was pretty good at tennis and competed in USTA, but never really fell in love with the sport the way the family did (and as a result never got past the Open-level). I actually grew to resent both my dad and the sport and left it all together. I watched it with my family and got the feeling that I came away with different takeaways than them.

Like Richard was great and all, but only because it worked. I burned out from the expectations, pressure, and I often feel fractured from all the pressure that was put on me (not just tennis, but really everything). 

Should we applaud Richard for empowering two of the greatest athletes of all time and a symbol of pride for the Black community? Is this what it takes to be ‚Äúgreat‚Äù? What about people like Capriati and all the ‚Äúlesser‚Äù athletes like me who never got close? Did their dads and mentors do the right thing as well?

Again, lovely movie and great acting. Found myself tearing up a lot. I guess I‚Äôm just using this comment as a journal entry.",qxv3pk
hlnet8p,"  
I saw the movie yesterday, and will smith becomes richard, bravo...i also understand those who say that richard's character is sweetened to make it easier to see ... now my problem is that in the emotional climax of the movie, the talk he has with Venus where he says i do not want you to look up and see your father running in fear as it happened to me as a boy, that whole scene loses all power knowing 5 minutes before that he had abandoned his other children, he became his father and the movie never answers to this...",qxv3pk

hlcrtor,Very enjoyable. I liked the casting in general and thought Will gave a great performance. It was interesting seeing the Williams sisters early years and learning about Richard.

hlhguiy,Good movie. I hope Jon‚Äôs character got paid well. He got screwed all movie.,qxv3pk
hlqodsq,"Why are Williams sisters not the center of this biopic? While I thought Will Smith did a good job disappearing into his role, I didn't find Richard fascinating enough to sustain a 2.5 hour picture. When it becomes a Venus movie near the end, I was engaged, but frustrated that I wish it spent more time with the sisters on what they think of their father and the path they've taken. Did they somewhat resent him, did they doubt his plans, and did they trust him completely with sprinkles of doubt? 

When I saw Venus and Serena as executive producers, it explained why it felt too clean or sanitized to me. 

Unfortunately I have to add this to the pile of biographies where there's a great strong central performance, but everything else isn't up to that level.",qxv3pk

We have 3 young kids so getting us to stay up past 11pm is almost impossible. The story was so inspirational and nuanced. I loved how I had mixed feelings at different times of the movie, but I also really understood his intentions. I love Brandy (the mom). She was supportive, but also clearly an equal. She just let Richard stand in the spotlight. Amazing film.",qxv3pk

hlco96r,Smith did a good job changing up his voice and body language for the part. Story lost its momentum in the second half and felt more rote.,qxv3pk
hlgp5zw,"This film was outstanding. To me it should be the gold standard that all other biopics should look to. Asks tough questions about its subject, was a deeply nuanced and at times visceral look at a complicated man, and gave absolutely outstanding acting performances. I see some describing this movie as a love letter to Richard ‚Äî i view it as an unpacking of a deeply narcissistic man who also had a profoundly positive impact on his children. Which I found much more compelling.

 I know a lot of people will rightfully shout out Will Smith ‚Äî but Aunjanue Ellis as Brandy truly affected me in that scene in the kitchen, and should receive award buzz for this performance.

I rarely have walked out of a 2.5 hour film saying ‚ÄúGod I wish that were longer‚Äù ‚Äî but I would have enjoyed a film double it‚Äôs length that delved into Serena and Venus‚Äôs dynamic and rise in the professional space, from their perspective. I hope someday to watch that film with a similar nuanced treatment it deserves.",qxv3pk
hlgslc1,"I was more impressed than I expected.

Fact is, way more of that actually happened than you'd expect. 

As a (new) Black dad, it definitely pulled on my heartstrings, as it intended to. But I remember being at a party with Black friends when Serena won her first US Open in 1999, and, well, the family really had an impact.",qxv3pk
hlhhtsy,"I think the Williams sisters are incredible. I grew up playing tennis the same time as them. I recall only ever hearing about them and their amazing father.

Unfortunately, I don't think this film is completely accurate. It probably is for the sisters who helped produce it, but after reading what his other children have said about him, I think he's a raging narcissist. He is quoted saying he just had kids because he knew they'd make him more money. That gives me creep vibes. 

He also told the press that he chose to move them to Compton so they'd sound more like a success story to the media. Exploiting your kids for marketing opportunities might be socially acceptable in sports, but I don't think it should be. I think kids should be kids and we make that next to impossible once they enter into the world of professional sports before they're 18.

We watch so many young athletes suffer from parents that are too pushy. It sounds like Serena and Vwnus wanted to have their version of their father out before he passes away since he's in bad health. I totally understand that, but I can't help but think that the 5 children he abandoned must see this film as a giant slap in the face.",qxv3pk
hlcbymx,"I'm a sucker for any feel good sports movie, and this one delivered. Great casting and acting all around. I always love Bernthal and he was great, but Smith had his best role in awhile as well.

hljvwj8,"Loved this movie, agreed that it's Will's best performance though the acting was great across the board. Hoping Will, Aunjanue Ellis and Jon Bernthal all get Oscar noms.

I'm bummed that this is struggling at the box office though I'm sure the HBO Max deal played a role. To me this is the perfect Holiday film for the fam, hoping through word of mouth it picks up some steam because I'd hate for this to be dismissed as just the latest underperforming Will Smith movie.",qxv3pk
hlogixq,We need more biopics on the Williams sisters. Why'd it take so long for this one?,qxv3pk
hlohfux,I wanted this movie to be 10 more hours and go to when Serena and Venus have to play each other.,qxv3pk
hlgidu4,I kept feeling bad for Jon Bernthal as he had the rug pulled out from under him so many times,qxv3pk
hljde4l,"Great movie. A little bit before my time, but certainly as a kid I remember hearing about how great the Williams sisters were, cool to see how that happened. 

When I first heard about this movie, I thought it was kind of weird that it was about the dad and not the girls. But now I get it, the movie's not just about ""look how good these athletes are!"". It's about what being a father means, sticking to your guns, knowing how to do what's best for your kids but also knowing when to let them speak for themselves. Something I really appreciated were the uncomfortable/awkward moments where Richard was trying to be charismatic/funny/inspirational, and it didn't work. And that's not bad writing, the movie didn't let it work, because in real like you don't get every moment right. Like the joke about ""yall took yall's hoods off"", that was cringe! Overall I think a lot of fathers can actually identify with Will in this movie - you don't get every moment right, but the important part is to stick to some plan and be purposeful about your relationships with your children. No, it's not enough to just be there, be a guiding force in their lives.

Aside from Will, other standouts are Jon Berenthal and the girl playing Venus. Not to say the Serena actress was bad, but she was actually kind of tertiary in the movie. Didn't expect that, but hey, if that's how it was IRL then that's how it was. Obviously now both of them are rich and famous, so I doubt there's any bad blood there. Overall I hope this movie succeeds as a biopic, meaning that not only do audiences enjoy it, the real-life people involved can at least tolerate it. Like, no one comes out and says they were misrepresented, the writers lied, etc... no one likes to see that drama. That said it's another HBO Max movie, i.e. financial flop, but hopefully people don't treat any of the same-day releases as failures based on the box office. I think people will remember this as a success.",qxv3pk
hobgdjt,"Is any ody else wondering why the neighbor called child services and is worried about the girls? If that is from their real history, then there must be a reason. But then they give the dad the Hollywood treatment and make it seem like there's absolutely no reason any ody should worry. Seems like an oversimplification or rosy way of hiding something about their childhood.

So I go online and see that he allegedly broke his wife's ribs and she didn't want to press charges bc she didn't want it to mess with the Williams sisters' budding careers.

Also like WHY even make the movie all hero worshipping the dad, instead of putting the actual amazing tennis pros themselves, the sisters, in the main roles? We still have to tell women's stories through a man or something?",qxv3pk
hlezgc3,Haven‚Äôt seen it yet but question. Do they portray Richard as the piece of shit he was? Abounding his children from the previous marriage and all that? Or is it glossed over?,qxv3pk

hlln939,Super minor thing but I did laugh when Richard was driving around looking for those dudes that beat him up and looked at a liquor store that had a big ‚ÄúHARD SELTZER‚Äù sign in the window. Guessing that wouldn‚Äôt have been there in the early 90s. Overall really liked the movie!,qxv3pk
hm46e36,"It was a solid flick. In the moment, I enjoyed the film. Will Smith (the acting in general) is deserving of the hype. However, reading about Richard after the movie is another story altogether. They really glossed over and left out a lot of key details about Richard‚Äôs life to make him seem more relatable. Based on the movie, you would think he‚Äôs a standup guy who only wants what‚Äôs best for his kids. After a Google search, he has a ton of skeletons in his closet. This is the American Sniper of sports movies.",qxv3pk
i07xsde,Hated it. A warts-and-all depiction where the warts are so prominent that I did not want the man to succeed. This movie wants me to believe that he was smart and knew what was best for his kids the entire way through but all it seemed to me is that he was a gambler that got lucky,qxv3pk

Solid film overall.",qxv3pk
hlnus8y,That was a phenomenal movie.,qxv3pk
hy9jpez,"Damn did Will Smith work on his accent for this one. The *original* LaVar Ball.

I like a movie about the black experience that doesn't require a white villain. There isn't that ""get out of the pool"" character that Bill Burr complains about. The worst they do is politely decline Williams's ludicrous offers with sometimes less-than-sensitive language. In most of those scenes he comes off as the unreasonable one. It's still a fight and a struggle, though. Life is hard, competition is fierce, and nobody's gonna hand it to you. 

If there is a clear villain in the movie, it's the roving gang of Compton pedophiles. Am I really supposed to believe that Richard Williams would be a murderer right now if not for a very convenient drive-by? I don't. 

The order in which information is revealed is very important in framing how the audience sees a character. If we'd started with Williams's first family, there would be a much more sinister light behind the training of his daughters, because his love would seem more transactional and we're not sure if he'd stick around if they didn't win. As it is we don't find out about that until well after we've watched him being extremely devoted to his current family for an hour and a half.

I also don't think we're supposed to like his managerial skills. Even if you're not a tennis fan you know going in that this works out for them, but if you're literally anybody else this strategy will be a disaster. [Survivorship bias is a bitch.](https://xkcd.com/1827/) I guess after they get to Florida they're playing with house money and at least aren't in danger of ending up back in the ghetto, but still. To be clear, this is not a complaint about the movie, which is probably just being accurate. What Richard did get right is making sure that everyone did well in school, which is the actual smart fallback plan. Even if, God forbid, his daughters didn't become the best tennis players in the world, they still had good prospects, if not ones of stardom, and that's what a good parent will work to ensure.",qxv3pk

It was a well crafted story with heart and emotion. I don't think there was a single weak element to the film or casting. Everyone went in and did some of their best work.... especially Will Smith who hasn't had a role like this in quite some time. He'll definitely receive an Oscar Nomination.

The movie itself was pretty average I thought, Will Smith just seemed a bit Oscar huntey for me, he was good and definitely went all in but felt like we got a Compton Bagger Vance performance.

Some things with the story ticked me off.. who hits balls into the darkness at midnight in Compton.. of course you will get pistol whipped. Also when they played juniors, every kid they beat had a tantrum and their parent/coach would run off furious.. come on. Richard came across quite unlikeable to be honest, the mother seemed to be the most endearing.

King Richard to me just felt like a one mode kind of character? He‚Äôs a bit intense and overbearing over the way he wants to push Venus & Serena‚Äôs talent and their legacy. Like whenever Will Smith gives a speech to talk about them, it‚Äôs almost like he‚Äôs had them memorized bit-by-bit where he‚Äôll talk about their age or their potential or demanding that they be humble. It reminded me a lot of Denzel in Fences, where sure the actor is doing a good job with that character but that dude only does so much before you get tired of his attitude.  


And it definitely feels like we are missing some aspects of his life, like when Brandy brings up that he had a son from another woman? Yeah, that gets shoved aside.   


It‚Äôs a very standard, straightforward biopic that looks good and has nice performances. But I don‚Äôt think this is a real standout compared to any of the other awards contenders this year. And I definitely think Will Smith is not the best performance I‚Äôve seen this year from an actor.",qxv3pk

hlm5lj6,"**Dirty Dancing** (1987)

So look, this is a movie that I have definitely *seen* before in my life, but a movie that I absolutely never gave a shit about. Last week my wife put it on the TV and I was really surprised at how much legitimate depth there is going on. There is a very central theme of **classism** in the movie that really elevated it from a sort of modern Romeo & Juliet type story.

Every ounce of the movie *seethes* with classist commentary. For one, the idea of how the sexuality of 'lower class' is seen as a product to be consumed, that the upper class doesn't merely view it as a product but feels *entitled* to it. How a (lower class ethnic etc....) young man is punished after cutting off a relationship with a (rich white etc....) older woman once he rejects her continuous advances. The thing of how the morality of the poor and lower class are *constantly* under scrutiny and second guessed in an instant, but how the actions of the higher class individuals are hand waved away, even to the point to where *when their misdeeds are discovered* they face less real consequences (slap on the wrist) than the main love interest and others (who are fired on a mere accusation, upheld even after it turns out to be false for the *sin* of fraternizing with the ""guests"").

Even the girl's upper class father, who is portrayed as a uncompromisingly loving father and an unequivocal ""good man"" is *no less guilty* of these behaviors, being equally quick and venomous in his condemnation based on a mere assumption of the situation of a young, lower-class waiter while *in the very next scene* chastising his daughter for trying to discuss the abhorrent behavior of an upper class man (""You can't go around spreading rumors!"").

Now, it is not a perfect movie or the best exploration of these themes, but I was really surprised at how much depth there really was under the surface of this one. Now, are these themes what was appealing about the movie, what people remember? No, but they are there. They didn't *have* to be there and could have easily not been. But the Director/Writer put some real thought and effort into having some real depth of the characters and themes, and the movie definitely deserves praise in this regard.",qxv3pk
i46fc24,"Just finished watching it, yup all 140 mins of it. I say that because it was hella boring to me. Maybe knowing what the film was going to be about and how it was going to end played a role in that, being very familiar with who Venus and Serena Williams were before watching it. 

Though I wouldn't say that as, Battle of the Sexes also had a very predictable ending and it still entertained me better. 

I found the direction t to be very dull, the film was extremely slow-paced and the performance by the cast was good, nothing exceptional imo, including Will's. 

To me is incredible that he was awarded an Oscar, SAG and Golden Globe, among many others, for this performance while he wasn't for Ali and The Pursuit of Happyness. He wasn't even nominated for Seven Pounds which is nuts.

hm47htz,"I disagree with this. 

There have been many prot√©g√©s in tennis who got mentally destroyed by being pushed into the pro tour at to young of an age. Venus only played a handful of tournaments until like 1998 when she was 18.

On the men‚Äôs side, look at Donald young or Richard Gasquet. They were pushed into playing tons of tournaments at 14 or 15 years old and never amounted to anything. People assume this was because they couldn‚Äôt handle the pressure, which broke down their confidence as adults.",qxv3pk
hm55vzu,"Finally the first comment saying what I was thinking all along. I hated the father. I've followed all sports for a while and I couldn't shake off the story of Todd Marinovich the entire time here. If you don't know that one please look it up.

We praise it because it worked out and they became great. But I think the moral of the movie is completely wrong and the story narrative is told all wrong.

Venus and Serena Williams as characters get essentially no story. They are the 2nd tier focus of the movie and I couldn't tell you a single thing about their personalities now if you just watched the film. 

Once they get that first look and people notice they (or Venus at first at least) are good, they basically get every advantage to becoming great given to them (a house, training, car, etc...) and that's about it. 

They teased it at the end but damn there's a much better movie hidden in here told from Serena Williams' point of view. The sister who was at first completely overshadowed and fought for years to become the best female tennis player of all time.

I'm sure I'll get downvoted but I didn't think this was a good movie.  There's no real drama because the sisters never really lose at any point, and it isn't like once the family got out of the ghetto that they had any true obstacles thrown their way. The biggest obstacle at times was the father and the movie portrays him as being ahead of the curve in his process rather than a sometimes loving, but more often than not toxic person who almost cost both sisters by being an unnecessary dick to everybody.

That's all I'm gonna rant for now about the movie. If you enjoyed the film that is great. Movie opinion is all subjective and often times people see performances differently.",qxv3pk

He almost has them watch Cinderella twice because they need to be humble, but if he didn‚Äôt spend all that time trying to show coaches how great they are they wouldn‚Äôt have a career at all.

I could, so of, understand where he was coming from - especially when it came to education - but I think that both Venus and Serena would have been so much more if he had stayed in the background and let the real coaches do their jobs. Everything revolved around his personal insecurities and fears and he projected them onto his children - especially when he felt like he was going to be irrelevant.

I‚Äôm (by all accounts) very successful in my field but it never feels good enough and I always feel like a failure even though I keep earning rewards and promotions. And I‚Äôm watching this with my dad and I can see how much he admires Richard. It hurts so much more especially because I‚Äôve specifically talked to him about how that pressure fucked me up and all he says is that the only person that‚Äôs responsible for my mental health is me and if I want to me happy I have to get over it. 

Fuck this movie. It might be good, but man I‚Äôm so hurt rn. Damnit.

Edit: just had a deeeeep heart to heart with my dad and it was really bad at first but he finally understood what I was saying and apologized. I think I can really start healing from this now. Maybe watching this movie have me the strength to finally confront that past resentment, so I guess it wasn‚Äôt a bad idea after all.",qxv3pk
hld0h9c,"I'm not sure if they did a great job of addressing that but the movie definitely tried to show he tried to keep the pressure from being too much. Like when he takes them out of the tournaments it's partly because he doesn't want them to feel too much pressure and burn out. And again when Venus wants to join the tournament later on, and he changes his mind because he sees what that kind of pressure at that age did to Caprioti. 

But also to your point about ""what it takes to be great,"" I think that the movie also tried to show that they were just more capable of handling that kind of pressure. That they were ""special"" so they could handle more pressure than other people.

Overall I definitely think the movie definitely toes the line about whether he was too hard on them. Like that since it did work out so well he just knew what his daughters could handle better than other people. For most people all the pressure he put them under definitely would be too much to subject a child to (which is why that lady who called the cops isn't entirely the bad guy I think), but we know in the end he was right so maybe he just saw something others didn't. I'm not sure if it's making that poiny for Richard in real life though, but I think that's how the movie wants you to feel about the movies version of Richard.",qxv3pk

hle8b7p,"I think for Richard Williams' flaws (and I was surprised at how straightforward the movie was about presenting them), at least in the move he didn't force his kids into something they didn't want to do. He could very easily have made their sisters play tennis if he was that bent on producing champions, but he didn't - he let them focus on their grades, and to the extent he does neglect them, he's called out on it by Oracene. 

The other thing is how much emphasis he puts on enjoying the sport, unlike Jim ""kill the bitch!"" Pierce, or John Tomic. The middle part of the movie is his fight against a tennis system that - especially on the WTA side - was (and to a lesser extent, still is) extremely unkind to its players.

I'm now a therapist. When adult children frame all their parents mistakes as good bc, in the end, everything worked out...üö©

Serena and Venus might mask well, but after reading accounts of their father from other children, I'd be surprised if they're not just in denial about how bad he really was.

This ESPECIALLY applies to physical competition, since in the arts/sciences one could reasonably argue that you could 'get lucky' and stumble upon the right circumstances/discovery, and you arent competing as directly with other people. But in physical competition if you're outclassed in physique/skill, you simply cannot compete.

My point being - maybe pushing the sisters that hard was detrimental and not good, but NO ONE gets that good without that level of effort. So if anything needs to be condemned, it is professional sports as a whole, not just any one instance of harsher parenting.

Anyways I'd debate the whole 'pushing your child is abuse' point as well. Do you have any actual evidence of abuse? Did any of the kids suffer from physical symptoms of any sort? did any of them faint from exhaustion, or have to go to the hospital? Do the williams sisters suffer mental health problems do to the strain in their childhood, be it depression, or addiction/escapism, or anything else? 

Because if theres no actual evidence, then it just sounds to me like people are imposing their own personal preferences onto the sisters. ""If I was in that situation and wasn't allowed to play videogames with my friends for 4 hours a day then I would be pissed and angry and that's abuse"" is not really a valid argument.",qxv3pk

Some coaches definitely abuse their kids through poor training. Some abuse their kids intentionally, thinking that toughing them up is key. Some abuse their kids through neglect and are shit coaches. Some abuse their kids by lying about their skill and wasting their time. 

It's not a cut and dry statement to make, and it's never that black and white. To get to the top of any activity, one might argue that athlete has to abuse themselves. You need someone to push you sometimes, even when it hurts.",qxv3pk

Also, I think Richard and earl clearly lived through their kids, which we all recognize is not the best life possible today",qxv3pk
hmdjfrk,The movie is from Serena and Venus‚Äô perspective. They acknowledged their dads flaws from a child‚Äôs place. There is no on way they could fully unpack their dad‚Äôs previous marriage and issues. Especially if that‚Äôs not what the movie is about. It‚Äôs about the fruition of his plan.,qxv3pk
hln5e3g,Yeah his wife called him out but it was very brief,qxv3pk
hlh72e0,Name on the door,qxv3pk
hlj76kp,That makes sense to me. It's like a somewhat- less-sanitized Bohemian Rhapsody from the sounds of it.,qxv3pk
hlhhhec,ngl the waterworks started at this scene and didn't really end until the credits,qxv3pk
hleaahf,Yea but big Willy style isn‚Äôt in those,qxv3pk
hld9yw4,He‚Äôs still alive?,qxv3pk
hz0hug6,"you mean ""Do not"" right? If so, why write ""don't?""",qxv3pk
hth5hy1,Thank you,qxv3pk
hlh2uf4,"Lmao you mad? Literally dude doesn‚Äôt try to act, that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre a fan or Stan and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs got millions of fans. People love his shtick, they love that fresh prince goofy acting. He never tries to reign it in and also I tried to watch concussion when it came out and that was trash too. Again once you‚Äôve seen him in something you‚Äôve seen him in everything. Don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre offended get over it. Not everyone likes his shit because of said reason.",qxv3pk
hlhnp1e,"Lol, you‚Äôre giving me too much credit.",qxv3pk
hlkgaoz,It makes for a very frustrating experience. I‚Äôll go multiple weeks without listening to their new episodes because I just have so little interest in watching what they‚Äôre choosing,qxv3pk
hlj5czm,DOZENS I TELL YOU,qxv3pk
i2i7b36,Golden Slam is winning all four plus Olympic gold in the same year.,qxv3pk
hleejl2,Yeah you hear the other dudes at one point say ‚Äúleave the old man alone‚Äù to the bully. Solid writing,qxv3pk
hlh4l7n,Yup 100%. Look up Damian Lillard,qxv3pk
hln7zh7,"What? No, that‚Äôs not at all what anyone is saying.",qxv3pk
i318gmp,"That was less a throwaway line, and more a big revelation about what sort of man he really is. Yes, the movie doesn't dwell on it but anyone watching that scene understands what it means.",qxv3pk
hlqq4p8,I‚Äôd love to get in to specifics! Please help,qxv3pk
hyn4hj5,Maybe they shouldn‚Äôt have made the movie then.  Arnold Schwarzenegger‚Äôs dad was literally a Nazi but nobody ever made a movie about what a great job he did raising a champion athlete.,qxv3pk
hlxw3vb,"Yea I had a feeling you were gonna say something like that. But damn he moved to Compton on purpose? That‚Äôs fucked up. 

It appears he only cared about kids that could make him money.",qxv3pk
hm4brw3,"He also has gone on record, saying he hid Brandy‚Äôs birth control pills so they would have more kids (resulting in Venus and Serena).",qxv3pk
hlvfmuu,Dwayne Johnson is a great example.,qxv3pk
hnofsmu,"Ha! In an EW interview, he talks about how he doesn‚Äôt do movies anymore for the money. He doesn‚Äôt need to. He does it to tell a story and respect the people the story is about. So much PR spin to it, but great movie nonetheless.",qxv3pk
hlfhjo4,this \^\^,qxv3pk
hlhhka3,"That's kind of my point though.  There's nothing _reasonable_ they could have done for her, and all the ""unreasonable"" things they did to and for Serena and Venus are reframed as a result.",qxv3pk
hm8r6w3,move her from a shithole like compton,qxv3pk
hlwsfeh,"Definitely not what I took away from the movie.

The pressure he was putting on them was for himself and his own trauma, it was not for the benefit of the kids. That's detailed pretty well in the kitchen scene and the finale.",qxv3pk
iwxhds8,"Praise and punishment are equally detrimental. Reinforcement of what a person does themselves helps them to see their own capability, helps them to feel their courage, and gives them true sense of self-worth and confidence.

Why? Because it was theirs, not his. Same is true of all of us ‚ô•Ô∏è",qxv3pk
hlgy8t1,very understandable,qxv3pk
hmektud,Seems like a big part of the fruition is too dump all his resources into two kids and basically ignore all the others.,qxv3pk
hlh3946,K.,qxv3pk
hlm3wen,Yea and then they jump him,qxv3pk
hlhp40g,Derozan similar story and from Compton,qxv3pk
hln8a9m,then what are people saying?,qxv3pk
hlrpwx9,No way,qxv3pk
hm00owe,Some of his stuff is so boring. Like San Andreas and Jungle Cruise. San Amdreas is kind of hopeless but Jungle Cruise would have been better with someone else.,qxv3pk
hnog33t,That's hysterical. I have to check it out.,qxv3pk
hm8rkie,Forcibly move an adult woman who is seemingly in her right mind?,qxv3pk
i3194o5,I think the movie showed that the pressure did benefit his kids,qxv3pk
hmg6t6m,It can come off that way if you view it like that. I would definitely need to do more research about their family before agreeing.,qxv3pk
hlh3hne,Lmaooooooo mad cause someone‚Äôs gotta different opinion than yours LMAOOOOO,qxv3pk
hlnfews,Seems like they were in a gang and got killed in an incident completely unrelated to the girls. Think the whole point of that storyline was to demonstrate how shitty Compton was to grow up in.,qxv3pk
hm8taum,no one in their right mind would choose to stay in compton,qxv3pk
i31983r,Which kids,qxv3pk
hlnfxos,"that‚Äôs what I thought the storyline was but when reading the comments it sounded to me like there might have been something I missed. 

Thank you so much for clarifying ‚ò∫Ô∏è",qxv3pk
hmm5epa,It was absolutely related and common form of politics in the hood.,qxv3pk
hm9tov6,No one chooses to live in a shitty place where all their friends and business are? C‚Äômon now. That describes the case majority of people. Moving and starting over is *hard* and most of us don‚Äôt do it.,qxv3pk
hmhkojy,Richard chose to move his family to Compton to build character essentially. It‚Äôs fucked up from the start.,qxv3pk
i31cc9c,"Venus and Serena? 


Plus he taught all (well, the family he did raise) good values, to get good grades, kept them off the street etc. For a family growing up where they did, not everyone had that",qxv3pk
