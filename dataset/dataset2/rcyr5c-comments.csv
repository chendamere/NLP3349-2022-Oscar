hnyo7gq,"Most people are commending Ariana Debose and Mike Faist and rightfully so, but it’s also worth mentioning that David Alvarez as Bernardo is also freakin incredible! He took a 10+ year hiatus from acting (he was a child actor on Broadway) and he came back with a BANG.

ho6iiax,"I liked it a lot. Everything that was in Spielberg's control works, and it really shows that this was a passion project.

My only problem with the film isn't really with the film, or even the stage play, but rather the fact it's a *Romeo and Juliet* story, which means the two central characters are by far the least interesting of the piece. Zegler's wonderful, Elgort's fine (less wooden than usual, I thought), they get good songs, and the meeting at the dance is great, but you're still stuck with a little bit of 'yeah, yeah, we get it; you're young and completely smitten with each other.

Absolutely gorgeous cinematography and top tier music, choreography and acting. In many ways this is better than the original. It feels so much more alive with an actual feel of the city and of course latinos playing the parts of The Sharks.

The only thing that bothered me a little bit is how Maria basically didn't react at all to her brother dying and just brushed it away so quickly. 

Also about the Spanish subtitles controversy. Do not worry! Nothing said in Spanish is important to the plot and a lot of stuff they say in Spanish they immediately say it in English next. Plus Anita tells her family to speak English at all times to practice",rcyr5c

hny6gt0,"West Side Story looms large in the cannon of classical Hollywood films and it seems too taboo for any filmmaker to consider remaking it. And yet Steven Spielberg’s hands us a remake that not only improves upon the original in terms of pure craft and spectacle. But also re-examines the plot and it’s story beats in way that perfectly re-contextualizes  it for a modern audience. Which could not be done without Tony Kushner’s help who writes with such deep knowledge and empathy for his characters, which provides levity to what is ultimately a melodrama. One sequence that stood out to me was Tony’s ‘Maria’ which not only has fun with his head-over-heels romanticism but also subtly highlights his own privileges. 

I wanna acknowledge Janusz Kamiński who does an excellent job matching the energy of the original’s frenetic camera movements. While also being able to light and frame scenes with such a clear vision that makes the movie feel like a living piece of art. 

It’s also thanks to Adam Stockhausen whose incredible production design who finds great balance between delivering us a New York that’s in decay but somehow brimming to life with color and character. A favorite set price of mines being the salt flats where the rumble takes place at the end of the first act. 

The cast is fucking stellar and there’s no real weak link in my opinion. Some stand outs include Mike Faist as Riff whose choices add great danger and sadness to the character. The build up to the rumble almost feels like a spiral in a sense. Also Ariana DeBose kills it as Anita who walks the full spectrum of human emotion and makes it look so easy. I want to shout out Rita Moreno as Valentina whose reimagining of Doc is okay with such quite restraint that she can command attention with the faintest of movement. Her version of somewhere is absolutely heartbreaking and the age and experience she brings to it deepens the song’s emotional core. 

If La La Land wasn’t enough to convince people that musicals deserve a place in film than West Side Story will prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt. As much of a drag as it was to wait for this movie (rightfully so) I’m glad I was able to experience it in theaters.",rcyr5c

ho0fzys,"I am still in tears from this movie. I genuinely thought it was absolutely incredible. Definitely my new favourite movie musical, for sure. I had no complaints about Any of it. Loved every scene, loved every actor, loved every dance. I was moved to tears several times by just how emotional it made me feel, whether that was elated or sad, nervous or excited. The dancing was a true highlight, the music, the costumes, everything.

Aside from that, I found every alteration to be just. The entire film was a wonderful movie musical from start to finish, with each scene highlighting the purpose of its place in the plot.

ho3367j,"Señor Spielbergo does it again!

This reminded me of Gerwig's *Little Women* insofar as it's an adaptation that is clearly in dialogue not just with previous versions of the musical but also all the cultural conversation and critical analysis of those earlier versions. Now, it doesn't do the sort of radical meta-incorporation and structural revision that Gerwig does, but it's a very literate adaptation nonetheless.

Also, while most of the attention will (for obvious reasons) be paid to the meatier ways that Kushner has reworked the script, I was greatly amused that he bothered to incorporate a response/acknowledgement of the longstanding joke people made about Tony running through a Puerto Rican neighborhood crying out ""Maria!"" and only having one woman answer.

They also revise a few of the soliloquy numbers (both of Tony's solos) to have more stuff actually happen during them, which greatly improves the cinematic quality. I especially liked ""I just kissed a girl named Maria!"" being directed at a passing janitor.

I'd say this is an improvement on previous versions of this in pretty much all areas. Spielberg does so much more with the camera than Robert Wise ever could (or, in fairness to him, had at his disposal given the technologies of the time), the acting is more to modern tastes and I would say is just stronger across the board, and the extensive revisions Kushner made to the book of the musical add way more to the characters.

There was a teenage girl in the screening I was at who delightedly exclaimed ""Maddie!"" when Ms. Ziegler came into focus during the big gathering at Doc's (I guess she must not have noticed her during the ""Dance at the Gym"" sequence).",rcyr5c
hnxvqt0,Spielberg did it better. I prefer the story beats in this than the 1961 one.,rcyr5c
ho7a5p0,"Just viewed it. Entered the theatre with some serious skepticism about a remake, but was blown away.

The NYC sets, cinematography, sound, vocal performances and acting were all top-notch. All the actors were excellent, but Ariana Debose as Anita and Mike Faist as Riff really stole the show for me. The actors for Tony and Maria clearly had good chemistry; their singing was stellar. Did not mind Elgort's bland face once he started singing. And Rita Moreno's song was remarkably moving. The overall direction was perfect, as were changes to the book. Found myself moved to tears multiple times.

The choreography was amazing; much more a part of the ongoing action as opposed to the more set-piece, theatrical sequences in the original. Was surprised by my experience. This film is magnificent; I love the original but this was arguably better.",rcyr5c
hofjrek,Holy shit. This movie is so damn well shot and directed I feel like Spielberg was born to direct musicals. This was incredible.,rcyr5c
hoh8x71,"Two years ago, right before the pandemic hit big, there was a brief revival of West Side Story on Broadway (before it was forced to shut down). It even featured a few of the same faces that are in this movie. From a technical standpoint it was great: There was a big LED backdrop that showed a bunch of video vignettes and had a small, retractable wall one one side that served as Doc's shop. There were some even points where a cameraman filmed the actors on stage with a Steadicam.  
  
Everything else about that revival was fucking awful.  
  
It was squeezed down to a one-act, 1hr 45min version which deleted a bunch of ""unnecessary"" elements including I Feel Pretty (which is debatably the most famous song in the entire goddamn show). They modernized the setting to present day, but still kept in the all the 50's slang like ""daddy-o"", which just felt distracting. They also tried to do the Hamilton thing by having a racially-diverse ""progressive"" cast, but that meant people of all colors were cast as both Jets AND Sharks, so the audience couldn't tell who was who. 

The whole thing felt like that one recurring SNL skit where the drama kids put on their own show and try to make profound messages about society, but they all just sound like a bunch of pretentious idiots (Think r/im14andthisisdeep ). I thought that shitty Broadway revival was basically how this remake was gonna turn out. Thank God it wasn't.

I actually think this was better than the 1961 film. The tipping point for me ended up being Rita Moreno's rendition of ""Somewhere"". Emotional and fragile; and a stark contrast from the rest of the songs up to that point, which were pretty much big and boisterous.

  
Also, in hindsight, I'm SO happy that Spielberg didn't do the obligatory musical-adaptation ""Oscar-Bait"" crap, AKA when they insert a brand new song into a classic musical just so they can snag an easy ""Best Original Song"" nomination when the Oscars roll around. It's so fucking unnecessary. The older songs are fine enough!",rcyr5c
hotru7b,"Saw this over the weekend and just can't stop thinking about it! One thing I really loved was how impressionable Riff was to the Jets. I think removing him from the Officer Krupke number gave the other Jets some time to get some backstory, but also showed that Riff isn't necessarily ""psychologically disturbed"" like the rest of them. 

The rape scene again showed us that with out Riff they really are kind of a pack of mindless hyenas because I think had Riff been there, Anita wouldn't have been in that situation. I think they did a great job with Riffs character in this and really made him feel like a very tragic character that clearly was very influential to a often cruel group of guys. He truly gave them purpose.",rcyr5c
hp8ezvk,"I went back to watch a second  time and it was mostly to watch Mike Faist dance. He's really phenomenal.  Especially since he lost 20 lb for the role that he didn't have as ""extra"" in the first place.  (His call, he wanted to look poor as hell).

Things I figured out the second time:

In their faux-marriage song, Tony sings ""Even death won't part us now"" and Maria sings ""Only death can part us now"". Ouch.

Tony's a fairly complex character and he's fleshed out a lot in this version,  but Maria is too in a way.  She's not just  a frustrated teenager who wants independence, she's also a horny young woman who sees her brother having fun while setting HER up with a square.The romance never really made ANY sense in the old  movie to me, and this one, I get it. Kinda.  It's over the top, but it's much better than the old one in terms of that relationship.

When Tony walks into the dance he enthusiastically greets Anybodys (the trans character) with a bro hug.  Nice character moment.

Officer Krupke doesn't really do anything bad, while the detective is a real POS.",rcyr5c
ho02yvq,"I feel like Spielberg has been putting out solid 6-7/10 movies for the last 15 years or so, so it's hugely refreshing to see a film he clearly has a ton of passion for.

hnxxy50,Really enjoyed the film but Ansel Elgort really feels miscast to me. He doesn't have that much on-screen charisma. He can act sad and angry but there's no charm or excitement displayed during any of the romantic scenes.,rcyr5c
ho2p1y6,Surprised by how much Spanish I know,rcyr5c
ho71t2k,"Wildly unpopular opinion here but I really liked Ansel’s performance in this film. He has a great voice and usually does really good on the big screen. Having not heard about anything going on with him in the tabloids  before googling the movie, I would’ve given him an 8/10 easy",rcyr5c
hoe3j8m,"So I'm in my mid thirties and I have never watched West Side story before. I've heard 1 or 2 songs before but I've never known the story details. So I went in with almost entirely fresh eyes.

The movie was beautifully shot. Visually it was stunning. I was really liking the story UNTIL Tony killed Bernado. I get why he did it (anger after killing his friend, wanted to retaliate) so that part of the story doesn't bother me. Its Maria forgiving him the same night and then sleeping with him literally hours after her brother died. From this point onwards I didn't like one character from the movie.",rcyr5c
ho35ui7,The “no subtitles thing” is a non-issue.  And if you don’t speak Spanish it’s actually pretty immersive.,rcyr5c
ho2nfkt,"Wow! This not only better than the previous adaption, but structurally superior to the original too. It just feels so alive. The entire of supporting cast is knocking it out of the park with so much personality and life. The main leads do a solid job holding up the love story, which admittingly was the weakest part of the original show. 

This is the best film musical I've seen in a long time. The choreography isn't chopped up in editing while the framing is focused on the right people when they sing. 

The lighting began to bug me, because I had close encounters and ET vibes where I was expecting aliens to land any second. 

I might go see this again, but man musicals are really long sometimes.",rcyr5c

hoayqdr,"Though it was very nice (and cute?) for Tony to learn how to speak cute and nice things in Spanish to Maria, it would have been nice to have had had him actually know a bit of Spanish seeing as he’s been working for Valentina for a year? Like to see him step in and try to defuse part of the rumble with some Spanish to Bernardo could have helped.",rcyr5c
hpb61wz,"I've honestly never understood why viewers hold it against Tony that he kills Bernardo. He didn't do it in cold blood. It's the same as not understanding why Harry immediately tried to kill Bellatrix after witnessing her kill Sirius Black.

Not only did Bernardo coldly stick his knife forward that resulted in the death of Tony's best friend, but he actually aimed to kill Tony. He went to the rumble with the aim to kill his sister's true love. And THIS is the same man you're all feeling sorry for? Like, WHY? Is it just because you feel sorry for Anita? Well I'm sorry but it has to be said: Bernardo is not the great guy some of you make him out to be.

Remember in the 1961 rumble scene when he deliberately provoked and made fun of Tony because Tony wouldn't fight him? Bernardo takes pleasure in mocking Tony's attempts to be good. He knows that Tony loves his sister, and he selfishly tries to ruin it because of the childish war between him and the other Jets. Ultimately, he's no better than the Jets because of how he tries to destroy Maria's happiness.

The prejudices come from both sides. The Sharks call the Jets ""gringos"" and ""Polacks"" (yes, it IS possible to be racist against White men, who in this story are of Irish, Italian and Polish descent). I'm not denying the Jets go too far in their actions against the Sharks (and eventually Anita), but Bernardo doesn't exactly try to stop the violent situation from escalating, either. Anita often tries to persuade him to live peacefully in America and her words fall on deaf ears. Both Bernardo and Riff think they know what's best for everyone, and that's why things take a turn for the worst.

If you're going to hold it against Maria that she sleeps with Tony then be my guest, but you should be using the reason that they've basically just met each other the night before and she's very naive in the whole idea of what love means. Yes, Tony killed her brother. And why did he do that?? Because he witnessed her brother killing his best friend. Let's stop kidding ourselves and stop pretending that Tony is an awful person for doing what most people would at least consider doing when they see their brother figure get knifed to death.",rcyr5c
ho7vdn6,"Anyone happen to have a screen grab of that gorgeous shot of Tony standing in the puddles and the reflection of the lights?

ho3qhjk,"I had to let out a silent ""holy shit"" in the middle of this adaptation. The movie completely blew away my expectations. Spielberg delivered one of the best movies of his career and; frankly, possibly one of the best musicals ever, at least in recent memory. It deserves all the nominations and awards It's inevitably going to get. Definitely tied for my favorite film of the year alongside Dune, so far. 

Also, as a bilingual Latino I really appreciated the lack of subtitles. It definitely added some extra emotional weight to the Spanish and Spanglish dialogue. Especially towards the end of the film. Spielberg's decision treated both cultures with equal appreciation and respect. At least to me, it made a positive impression.",rcyr5c
hny0fh3,"Welp this is one of my favorite movies of all-time. First of all, I loved how the griminess of the city contrasted with the whimsical musical aspects. My biggest worry was alleviated within three seconds of Ansel Elgort first opening his mouth to sing, and of course Zegler is a once-in-a-generation talent. Ariana DeBose really stands out with only a small amount of screentime also. Also what’s this? Elgort can actually act? Who knew?! He sold THAT >!realization, that ended up being false,!< scene brilliantly, and really had a captivating screen-presence, especially in his scenes when he isn’t being overshadowed by a much greater screen-presence.

As for Spielberg’s direction, he feels so *confident* in this. Literally every frame feels like it’s bursting with so much purpose and meaning (much credit goes to Janusz Kaminski here as well). Despite the long runtime, there are no wasted scenes, no sections that drag or feel unimportant to the central conflict. On the contrary though, nothing feels rushed. Every main character is properly fleshed out, with their own motivations that make me care about all of them, not just Tony and Maria. Lastly, I really appreciated that the musical numbers never felt cheesy, or even worse, wooden and joyless, which they often do with lesser filmmakers. For me it’s Spielberg’s most assured effort at least since *Munich*, maybe even *Saving Private Ryan*.

So far this is my choice for Best Picture and Director, as well as Rachel Zegler for Best Actress, and a nomination for Cinematography (still prefer Dune for that one, but only slightly.) and noms for all the below-the-line catagories. Spielberg has managed to do the impossible and make a definitively better version of an all-time classic.

Edit: **Also, if you are worried about there not being subtitles for the Spanish dialogue, allow me to alleviate your fears. Nothing that is said in Spanish is important to the plot, and Maria’s family is trying to get in the habit of speaking English predominantly, so a lot of things are said in Spanish and then actually repeated in English.** Also due to the strength of Zegler’s acting and Spielberg’s direction, so much is communicated non-verbally that you get the jist of what’s being said anyways.",rcyr5c
hnzt8bv,"A big gripe I had with the original was the hamminess and intrusiveness of the Puerto Rican accent.

hnxvu1p,This was the most homoerotic Spielberg could have made this and it was amazing,rcyr5c
hny23ze,"In no way or world is the original better than this. Literally everything is improved in Spielberg’s version, from the music, to the visuals, to the performances, to the story, to the characters actually feeling like people. It actually feels like it takes place in a city rather than an abandoned ghost town, musical numbers like America feel infinitely better because of this as well, with the characters singing about life in America while… and I know, it’s crazy, **going through America**.

The complaints and comments on here from *before* the film released about how awful it was that the Spanish wasn’t subtitled was nuts with me not being a Spanish speaker and not feeling like I missed anything aside from a couple jokes that were probably meant for actual Spanish speakers. No important plot points were spoken solely in Spanish, as anytime something crucial was said, it was then spoken in English right after. Seriously dumb as fuck that there are people that are so upset by this decision before even seeing the movie.

Chino, Tony, and Maria all feel like they actually have dimensions to their humanity, with Chino literally being a background character in the original with maybe one line of dialogue, if that, Maria being nothing more than a pretty face, and Tony just being “out of the Jets”, with Maria now having an actual personality and Tony having a backstory.

This was phenomenal and has a very good shot (as it should) at cleaning house during award season. Spielberg did his shit with this.

If Disney ever decides to do something with the Roger Rabbit property, give me Mike Faist AKA Riff, as the lead Weasel. And also, it’s been said plenty already, but Rachel Zegler is a STAR.

I loved the cast, historical accuracy to the sad reality of urban renewal and  making of New York’s Lincoln Square neighborhood, I love that there is more backstory to the characters, set design is stellar and the music is so good! I place this together with the 60s version . I recommend watching this film!

Just the overall feel of the dancing and contrast is so much more alive and every song has a bit more meaning behind it. It sucks that I was in front of three awful moviegoers who couldn’t shut the fuck up and laugh at the ending. 

I think that just speaks more to how much more I love this film. Great stuff and Spielberg just feels at the top of his game here.

10/10. I adored it.",rcyr5c
hobd3yg,"The film is a visual feast, the cast is terrific (the supporting players are on a league of their own), and the adaptation is mostly successful in updating the original’s themes, but something really bothered me in the second act. I can buy the “love at first sight”, tragic young lovers story, but the fact that they still staged every post-war event in the space of a single night drained the emotional impact of the deaths. I can buy that Maria fell in love with Tony at first sight; I can’t buy that she would be in the mood to have sex with him merely moments after learning of her brother’s death, or that Tony would get over the fact he’d just committed homicide (which is his entire emotional arc throughout the film) immediately after. This is something the adaptation could have handled better (even something minor, like all of this happening the following night, would help) instead of just going with the original script.",rcyr5c
homdlen,"With all the talk about and awards nominations for the ladies, I was surprised how good the male actors were when I saw it tonight. Ansel was perfect as the reformed thug who had his heart in the right place but couldn't escape the ghosts of his past. And his singing was just as fantastic and accomplished as Rachel Zegler's. I definitely felt a strong romantic chemistry between them. Knowing the ending already just made their scenes more poignant.

The casting of Mike Faist was ridiculously good. Obviously he looked the part as well as anyone else did here. I think he actually did the best acting in the movie as far as dialogue scenes go. This role could easily turn into a mustache-twirling thug, but he showed subtlety and depth that made you feel there was an unspoken history there that led him down the wrong path.

The music and dancing were really remarkable throughout the film. All the classic songs were done to full justice here. The new choreography for Officer Krupke was a real highlight I think. I love how much dynamic action they made happen on that small set. My car ride home zipped by so much faster than the ride to the theater, with all the music and energy of the film still reverberating in my head.

I'm not ready to say it was better than the original. I'd have to watch that one again. It's been decades. I don't think it's going to get Best Picture, because the fact that it's a remake is basically going to disqualify it. Spielberg may have a chance at director, and it should get some technical awards. But I think its most likely award is going to be Rachel Zegler. The movie isn't really being nominated for music because it's not original, but honoring her will be symbolic of honoring the musical accomplishment. Oscar has a history of giving awards to young actresses in a debut or breakthrough role. It doesn't hurt that it looks like she'll be the only non-white actress nominated, given the increased focus on racial diversity in awards. And seeing her give her speech will be like the culmination of a Cinderella story. That idea will be hard to resist for the voters.",rcyr5c

Bernardo looks stricken after that and doesn't try to defend himself when Tony lunges at him. I mean his beef was mainly with Tony, I don't think he wanted to kill anyone.!<

hqz95g3,"I had never seen West Side Story before nor really knew much about the story and went in blind, but I guess this one just wasn't for me. I get the whole Romeo and Juliet motif with young, dumb love set in New York City with racial tensions, but I was just out after her brother got murdered. I kind of rolled with it until then and mostly suspended my disbelief but I couldn't get over how she had a reaction for about 12 seconds before moving on with her life. And then follows it up by sleeping with the same guy hours later and then having the gall to make excuses about how much she loves him to Anita who just came back from identifying Bernardo's body. Word? This guy you met two nights ago with the charisma of a dead fish who just killed your brother?  How are you going to be singing about true love and all this garbage to a woman who just had her lover murdered, your brother, and is rightfully distraught? I just checked out after that. 

Aside from storyline issues that were just going to be endemic to a retelling of this story, I just could not get over how bad a casting job they did with Ansel Elgort as the lead. Other actors and actresses on this production could really sing and dance their asses off and were electric in scenes (Bernardo, Riff, and Anita especially) while this guy was really flat and had nearly negative charisma in most scenes. It felt kind of like Russell Crowe in Les Miserables for me. I just did not buy him as a Romeo equivalent at all, could not understand why she'd fall head over heels in love with THIS guy in specific, and just felt like he couldn't emote effectively at all. He was basically as flat as a thumb to me, I do not understand the appeal at all. I think this could have been much elevated with a better leading man, but Elgort just wasn't it at all. Horrible casting choice. 

Beautifully shot and mostly well acted (aside from Elgort), but you definitely felt that it was 2.5 hours long with how much it dragged on. And I'm a person that tends to like musicals but ultimately I just don't think this story was all that great, it was a bit too sappy for me, and the characters of Tony and Maria just took me out of it. And before anyone jump in with ""well it's Romeo and Juliet!"" I've always felt that R&J, compared to his other works, is one of the weaker stories penned by Shakespeare. And to carry a weak story in a high budget adaptation like this you need a dynamite cast and cannot flub your male lead. I'd give this like a 4/10.",rcyr5c

hnycel1,"I’m absolutely blown away. I’ve long considered West Side Story to be the greatest movie musical ever made and seeing a remake not only do the original justice but make *improvements* is not something I thought I’d see. Spielberg is an animal and I don’t know why I had any inhibitions about him taking the wheel with this. He knocked it far out of the park. 

This film walked the perfect line between being traditional and doing its own thing. The sets, the lighting, the choreo, the staging, everything, it all feels so classic yet entirely modern. Though I could have done without the 7325 lens flares in every shot, the cinematography for the most part had me in awe. There’s something so much more dimensional about this movie that feels a lot more visceral. The fighting is real and punchy, the sets are dark and gritty, and the dialogue is genuine and sincere. 

The casting director needs a huge bonus because everyone except Ansel was perfectly cast. So well, in fact, thst Ansel sticks out like a sore thumb not being able to keep up. Rachel Zegler knocked my socks off and Mike Faist brought to Riff the perfect amount of toughness with just a dash of boylike charm. Ariana DeBose stole the show for me; having only seen her as ensemble in Hamilton I had *no* idea she had the kind of acting and singing and dancing chops she has. Casting her was one of the best decisions they could have made for this movie. 

Also, I was super pleased to see a Newsie among the Jets! Ben Cook was always one of my favorite actors to watch in the filmed version of Newsies so I’m glad he got a semi prominent role as a Jet! 

Overall, this is an amazing return to form for movie musicals. 2021 has been a great year for musicals in general with Broadway reopening and so many great movies (In the Heights, Tick Tick Boom) coming out, and I think it’s nice to see a movie that bookends it all with classic bravado. 

I rate it a 9/10. I’d give this a 10/10 if it wasn’t for Ansel. (Sexual assault allegations notwithstanding)

It’s hard to really sell a Romeo and Juliet love story in this day where everyone knows it, but by making everyone in this a fully drawn character (even Chino has a complex arc!), it just makes the pure elemental nature of Tony and Maria’s tragic love that much more intense. When Tony gets shot, I actually felt my heart break for Maria. That’s nothing short of a small miracle in these days where Hollywood movies feel the need to layer so much ironic humor instead of reveling in the emotion of story. It is miles better than the 1961 original, and it is one of Spielberg’s best films in years.",rcyr5c

A couple of specific observations/opinions. I felt a bit lost at the very start, like I'd switched the film on part way through. It wasn't until they started talking that I felt anchored in it. And I was a bit suprised when Tony declared his all encompassing love for Maria after only one meeting. (A disclaimer here that I haven't seen any other versions of West Side Story, film or play so no idea how it's previously been handled it).

Acting wise Rachel Zegler was the highlight for me. She had such a presence and really made me root for Maria (and Tony).

hrpgm66,"Ansel Elgort was absolutely terrible in this. Every scene he was in was made worse by him and he was a terrible singer. Like, he honestly Almost pulled this movie completely apart.",rcyr5c
hnyf28k,"Initial reactions:

-Prologue. Favorite part of the original movie for me, the Robbins choreography is so taut and boiling with tension and just established character so fast and well. The new prologue felt jumbled and over too fast -- and I felt none of that crackling electricity and real animosity between Sharks and Jets at that early point. Everyone seemed so relaxed and it felt more like mild annoyance. I was surprised by how laid back and un-aggressive Riff was, though it becomes clearer why later and actually explains it better (he's played as a kind of complex, tragic figure with a death wish). The fights get scarier and better later on and the rumble is actually wrenching, but up till then, kinda just seems like a bunch of mellow guys mildly peeved with each other. 

-Tony is so much deeper and more layered in this movie, and Elgort does a pretty good job -- lovely singing voice. The baby face is hard to deal with but he brought grounding and depth to a formerly empty role. And how cool was the new ""Cool""!

-Latin characters all felt underwritten by Kushner, beautiful acting but just not given the same level of inner conflict or drama as the white ones. The women in particular were just so flatly written when compared to Riff or Tony. I feel like Kushner didn't really know what to do with Maria, Anita and Bernardo besides give them the most basic character strokes. It improves a bit as the movie goes on but you can definitely see where the screenplay's weight really lies.

-Rachel Zegler, WHAT a VOICE...tears. The balcony scene is magic. 

-Musical numbers felt a bit arbitrary/plopped in until we got to America and things got cooking -- the new America is FABULOUS and incorporates the whole neighborhood. Lots of good little character moments for folks like Chino. Overall, the numbers sung by Puerto Rican characters were better choreographed and filmed and executed overall, I thought (with the exception of the new ""Cool""). Dance at the Gym was a bit disappointing for the formerly mentioned reason, the Jets and Sharks never truly seem at odds or even to REALLY mind each other until later in the movie. 

-RITA MORENO singing Somewhere. Oh my god!

-ANYBODYS. Played by a nonbinary actor who delivers the first moment of true, shocking violence in the movie and really wakes it up. Extreme applause to Iris Menas and to movie for developing the original ""tomboy"" into something more complex. To be honest, Menas would have made a great Riff. 

-Back to Riff...I continued to feel really puzzled by Mike Daisy's portrayal until later on. In the original film Riff is a ball of tension, ready to blow, paternal and protective of his team but also a live wire. New Riff is...almost too relaxed in some ways, too unbothered. We get some backstory and some dubious explanation (Riff isn't *actually* racist, it's about...territory...?) but overall, Mike Faist seems much more inward and reflective and still and feminine and even intellectual than Riff 1.0. Like he doesn't even really care to fight. This finally clicks together at the rumble where it becomes clear that Riff doesn't really care whether he lives or dies, and has already in some sense chosen death, if that makes sense. We're watching a man who has already lost his will to live. It feels Shakespearean and ends up actually being quite powerful. But it took awhile to get there. As mentioned, Bernardo gets nowhere as complex a characterization -- his story is much more about pure survival and claiming his space and status, which flattens him out a bit. 

-Loved the Cloisters (?) scene, beautiful reimagining of the One Hand, One Heart scene. 

-I'd forgotten how bloody sad the whole movie is overall. The plot honestly makes much more sense than Romeo and Juliet as well. Every tragic mistake or decision makes sense and guts us with its ironies: above all, Tony ends up perpetuating the violence that he hoped to escape.

-I feel there is always more room to explore Anita's turn into a semi-villain near the end. Maria is an ASSHOLE singing about her love for Tony right as Anita is grieving her heart out, and Anita forgives her far too quickly for MURDERING THE LOVE OF HER LIFE. But I always think there could be more inevitability built in for her descent into ""Tell him Maria is dead."" Yes, it's a grief-driven betrayal, but in that case, show me her plans to marry Bernardo and have a family, show me more of her visions, show me more of what has been destroyed for her. It's incredibly sad that the singer of ""America"" ends up at the point that she would say Maria is dead and I want more of a roadmap there. 

Wow, that's all I can think of for now. Worth seeing, some really great stuff and some less great stuff, but overall, a great evening!",rcyr5c
hnz0mzx,"If you’re curious about the Spanish without subtitles. I attended a special screening for this where Spielberg and the cast did a live Q&A via satellite. Spielberg said that from the beginning he wanted to honor and respect the Spanish language used by Puerto Ricans, which is why he chose not to subtitle it. He said it was a way to not give it less importance than English.",rcyr5c
hnxv02g,"I don't know why people think they can bet against Spielberg. I've seen so many complaints on reddit that this is just more proof that Hollywood is out of ideas, but when I hear ""Spielberg wants to adapt classic"" all I get is excited. 

And what is there to say? This movie is incredible. You're already dealing with a proven script and musical that has stood the test of time, what could be made worse by adding probably most successful director of all time to the mix? It honestly feels like Spielberg was born to do musicals but he waited to do it right and honestly, this feels *very* right. 

This thing is just beautiful. The look of it, the feel, the dancing, the music. It is both extremely similar to the 1961 movie and also it's own and more modern take. I love the original film, it's so obvious why it's a classic. But there's things about it I don't love and it feels like Spielberg went out of his way to fix or update it. The dance-fighting feels more hard hitting, the musical numbers were bigger, the movie is much more grimy and unclean, the difficult parts are more difficult, the performances are more authentic, the songs don't sound like they were recorded 60 years ago. 

I think not adding subtitles was a ballsy as hell move. When I first heard about it I thought it was probably just a line here and there, stuff that could be communicated through the language of cinema. And while the second part is still true, not knowing Spanish I never felt like I didn't understand what was going on, there are some scenes that are almost half in Spanish. That's really surprising to me. It feels like the director has confidence that I understand subtlety and emotion even if I don't understand the words. 

Performances all around are just great. Smaller parts from the original aren't any bigger but are somehow more fleshed out. I thought the standout was Riff, something about that actor is just magnetic. But Bernardo, Anita, Maria, Valentina, Anybodys, all were just killing it. This is an easy 9/10 for anyone who loves musicals, loves the original, or just loves to feel.

 Out of all the remakes and reboots that have come out over the last 15+ years, plenty have been trash, and several have been good, but only a handful have been excellent. This film was just fantastic. I feel like every addition they made (Tony's backstory, Tony and Chino lifting the door together), every change they added (Tony singing ""Cool,"" The Jet girls being present at Doc's when Anita shows up, Valentina singing ""Somewhere,"" Valentina existing, provided new depth to the story and added real, poignant stakes.

hq94l8k,"I grew up watching the 1961 film regularly, since the first time my mum sat me down to watch it with her when I was 10. I lost count of how many times I’ve seen it, I know the dialogues, songs and choreography by heart and I can say Bernstein’s music is probably the cause I decided to dedicate my life to music; the first song I ever played by ear (in an old tiny Casio keyboard) was Maria. So I went into the cinema yesterday ready to judge a lot and hate everyone, particularly whoever was trying to get into Chakiris’, Moreno’s and Tamblyn’s roles.

But I obviously had a tiny bit of faith in Spielberg, who I really like and respect and is obviously a very good director with a lot of knowledge on how films are done.  Also Dudamel was my biggest hope that the music would at least be respected.

And I found myself enjoying very much. I was worried the choreography wouldn’t be as good but I saw they respected Robbins’ work giving it a bit of a twist. And surprisingly, they have kept the 1961 version of America rather than the original theatrical one (I guess  it’s too iconic now).

I liked the fact that they gave a bit more background to the characters (particularly in Tony’s case) and the singing was absolutely superb. Dancing was great too; even though you can’t top Chakiris and Moreno no matter what, I found myself not missing them as much as I expected.

Special mention to Mike Faist who really had me mesmerised (sorry Russ, I still love you) and was for me the real revelation in this film. Alvarez and Debose did a really great job considering what they had to live up to. And Rachel Zegler and Ansel Elgort both sing their very difficult songs amazingly.

So overall I enjoyed it thoroughly, despite my initial expectations. It’s not better or worse than the 1961 film, it’s just different. A fresh approach to a timeless classic, made with love and respect from all those involved. I sadly saw it dubbed (Spain keeps doing this, I just can’t understand it) so I’ll be waiting impatiently to have the opportunity of watching it in its original version.

Tony has a huge singing range, and I think Elgort sounded great. At times, he sounded a little like Michael Buble to me, in a good way.

Rachel Zegler and Ariana de Bose absolutely hit it out of the park. I can't stop thinking about their performances. I loved Rita Moreno as well -- >!it was a little jarring at first that her character more or less replaced the character of Doc, but I loved that she sang Somewhere, which, in the play is usually sang by just a random girl, who has nothing to do with the story and the events which had just unfolded.!< I wouldn't be surprised to see a Best Supporting Actress nod in her direction, and possibly Lead Actress noms for Zegler and de Bose. As we know, the Academy does love its musicals.

Mike Faist as Riff was very strong as well - >!his death, while it happened and was over pretty quickly, was heart-breaking. !<I saw him in Dear Evan Hansen on Broadway. Totally different character, and I didn't know if he'd have the chops to pull off Riff, but I thought he nailed it.

So many cool nods to old 1950s New York. I live in NYC and love the history of it, and it's such a different world today, but I loved seeing things like the old subway car, Gimbel's (the department store where Maria worked), the docks, etc. This is one of the aspects of the movie that I bet I could pick up on something new every time I watched it. Like Easter eggs for lovers of the city.

There were a LOT of changes from the play/movie, but as far as I can remember, all of them worked for me. I was near tears throughout much of the movie, and sat through the credits feeling gutted.

My biggest complaint was that the credit music was a bit too upbeat for how it ends.  Two lovers whose time together was cut way too short.  

I know Tony shouldn't get away at the end but damnit if I wasn't hoping him and Marie could go away from it all.

As a big fan of the original film (and the musical in general) I had my doubts going in.  But those were all put aside during the opening dance number.  The cinematography, the sets, the music all transported me into the world.

The added character played by Rita Moreno worked surprisingly well.

My one and only gripe has to do with the dance in the gym.  The meeting of Tony and Maria is my favorite music cue / choreography from any musical.  In the live show, the other dancers move off stage and almost fade away.  In the original movie, everything is out of focus except for Tony and Maria.  They're isolated in that moment of love at first sight.  I felt that was lost here by moving that scene behind the bleachers.",rcyr5c

   The movie was more grounded than the original one. I love how they gave more character to all the side characters. The Spanish felt natural and I like how there weren’t any subtitles (maybe because I understood so that’s subjective). It really felt like all the Spanish made up for the original movie where most of the Puerto Ricans were just white people with oil or makeup on them. I also enjoyed how they added a bit of the original Broadway version of America and mixed it with the original movie version. 
  
   I grew up loving West Side Story. I loved all the characters. My only downside to this movie is Ansel Elgort and how his Tony was scripted. Tony always seemed more of a innocent and good hearted person in the originals, but they tried to make him a badass in the beginning of this one and there’s kind of this redemption thing with Maria. I see where the idea is, but Elgort doesn’t really look like a badass and his singing voice throws me off a bit. Maybe I’m just used to the more operatic singing of the past Tonys. After a few watches I’ll probably get used to it, but it wasn’t horrible.

I just have one question: is the problematic storyline just accepted by everyone even in the original? I cannot fathom how Maria could just NOT care that Tony just killed her brother??? Like she didn’t even get sad for even one second? And straight away she’s like “no don’t turn yourself in” and have sex with your brother’s killer?? And Tony has no remorse?? And Anita allows this??? And Valentina still protects the Jets even if she just witnessed all of them gang up on Anita and attempt to rape her? (This scene boils my blood)

Mike Faist is a talented dancer and singer, but he looks nothing like a Riff.  As an audience, I didn't feel the deaths of Riff, Bernardo and Tony as I felt in the original 1961 film. Rita Moreno's role as Doc's replacement is also underwhelming.  Justin Peck's choreography is more complex than the original version by Jerome Robbins, but it feels artificial and out of place.

 I thought Ansel Elgort was awful and there was no chemistry whatsoever between Tony and Maria. Any version of R+J or West Side Story lives or dies on the audience being able to suspend their disbelief and really get on board with the instant, mutual obsession that these two have for each other, otherwise the rest of the plot makes no sense. This Tony just came off as toxic and creepy, and I wanted Maria to run far away from him. Also, there is absolutely no way that guy went to jail or put someone's life in danger. He acts like he grew up on a yacht.

I didn't like the music direction, and most of the songs felt way off to me. At one point, Tony and Maria are singing a duet a foot away from each other and two feet away from the camera, and it sounded like auto-tuned arena vocals. I kept thinking, ""huh, I remember really liking this song..."" Definitely some exceptions, though - Rachel Zegler is a really powerful singer and most of her stuff worked well. 

I don't think the play ages very well, and I'm not sure two aging white guys (Spielberg and Kushner) were the dream team to bring new life to a dated classic. I don't feel any sense of authenticity like I did while watching In the Heights, or even Encanto.

I didn't even like the way the movie looked - random lens flare all the time, and Spielberg liked his auteur shots (the kiss behind the colored curtains in Maria's place or the overhead shadows in the salt storage) so much that he uses them multiple times for diminishing returns. There wasn't enough visual distinction between the gangs and the world looked bland to me.

Ansel Elgort must’ve gotten the role because the studio needed a familiar face. His is the only one familiar to the younger audiences.

I commend the themes and characters for being complex and authentic, but I think it was a little too complicated for what was presented to be a musical romance. It got so messy in the second act that I found myself detached from the world and empathizing with none of the characters except for Anita.

The performances were good enough as to not be distracting, but I don’t find any of the characters believable. Bernardo is a professional boxer but participates in neighborhood rumbles? Tony came to stop the fight but ended up killing someone? Maria’s brother is murdered and she sleeps with his killer on the same night?

Their relationship isn't anything to fight for.

I have always felt like Spielberg makes lowest common denominator movies for people who claim to be into cinema. They’re marvel-esque. Very easy to digest, not too risky, tons of quippy jokes & dialogue. There’s a few exceptions like Schindlers List, Close Encounters & Catch me if you can…but that’s my take on him.

West Side Story is a safe remake that doesn’t take any risks. The direction is surprisingly good though. Great camera movement, flashy cinematography. But the dull color palate left a bit to be desired.

The story felt like it was trying to balance two different movies at once. I’ve seen the original but I was so young i don’t remember the plot but I know it’s the same thing. You can say “oh it’s supposed to not make sense, the point is blah blah blah…” the point was not made clear while watching. i’m sorry. and i’m glad to see most people agree. the love at first sight thing is fine, but i didn’t connect with the romance. 

I didn’t feel ANYTHING during any of the songs except I Feel Pretty & Ansel’s Maria song. Ansel is fine. A little dull sure. Bad lip syncing in the editing. Zegler was great casting, she was a good Maria. David Alvarez was just average to me. So many of the characters felt like caricatures & borderline racist versions of something more real. 

Debose was good but not great. I kept hearing from Oscar buzz that she was the best supporting performance of the year…really? Mike Faist had the best performance of this film.

hzocdvm,"Not that many changes between this one and the 61 version. A lot more Spanish, they gave a few songs to different characters than the original, the tomboy character is now implied to be LGBTQ, a lot more  about the neighborhood being torn up.

What makes a bigger difference than any of these changes is that the audience is a very different audience than in 1961. Interracial relationships are much more widely accepted now and the police aren't seen nearly as favorably. It's a lot more obvious that the cops are letting the white guys off easier. The attempted rape scene is taken a lot more seriously. I think this movie clearly sides with the Sharks. 

There are some things about this that are just never gonna age well. Our romantic lead's undoing is his personal devotion to a hate group. The central relationship is paper-thin and difficult to buy, but that's true of any accurate adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. 

I don't think this should have been nominated for Best Picture. On principle, I'm opposed to remakes of former Best Picture winners being nominated.

ho0jt0t,"So
Pros :-
1. Maria, Anita, Riff and Bernardo are outstanding. Each of them has layers and are played to perfection.
2. The way ""Cool"" plays out is neat. Also, ""Gee, Officer Krupke"".
3. Everything packed more punch in this version. Whether it is the brutality of the gangs or the appalling assualt of Anita which the girls try to stop, the rumble.
4. Ariana DeBose MAKES the 2nd half of the film. She grounds it so much. Anita is the heart of the film and Ariana DELIVERS.
5. The irony that the Jets and Sharks are fighting for land which will be taken away from them anyways is so maturedly handled and established.
6. The grandeur of it being a musical doesn't stand in the way of it being about this small, self-contained neighbourhood.
7. Anybodys and Valentina were standouts from the next rung of characters.

Middle-Ground :-
I love that 'America' is now staged as a community-wide event and its placement during the day also helps move things forward from the over-crowded night of the Dance. But I also miss the intimate and innocent setting of the Terrace for 'America'. It made the Sharks feel like a family.

I am also unsure about there being no songs with all of the Jets except for The Jet Song. Cool and Gee, Officer Krupke made us see the Jets also in more intimate settings and we were even more heartbroken amd disappointed when they do what they do to Anita. But I guess, this version is more grown up and doesn't sugarcoat their hatred.


1. 'I feel pretty' is a song of unbridled happiness. It absolutely doesn't belong to a minute after the deaths of Bernardo and Riff. It tinges the entire song and the dramatic irony of the audience knowing about their deaths makes the song a hard watch.
2. Maria just forgets Bernardo for Tony. This was a major issue with the OG version as well and a little more resistance from Maria's side was needed. She comes off as extremely selfish and naïve when we have seen her to be smarter than that. It would have been good enough if she had stopped with 'If you are not with me, how will I forgive you?'. Them sleeping together was so icky. 
3. Valentina helps Tony - a murderer - escape with his Lady Love and yet is the one to hand Chino over to the police. I know she likes Tony a lot but the double standard was so blatant. 
4. I felt that some of the transitions into song and dance didn't work so well. Both In The Heights and Tick Tick Boom elevated the integration of song and film. And the score also could have better matched the intensity of the story instead of just being instrumentals of the songs.
5. I missed Ice's presence in the third act. Ice in general was barely a character and removing his major moments sucked out any redeeming quality left in the Jets. The only thing that shone a glimmer of hope was their acceptance of Anybodys but this was immediately succeeded by them attacking Anita. If I remember right, Ice was not present in the OG version when the Jets assualted her and sealed Tony's fate.",rcyr5c

ho26rmi,"Story time: In April 2019 (three months before WSS started shooting), I had the opportunity to meet Rachel following her high school’s rendition of “Shrek the Musical.” She was so nice, and so I’m glad that after two years of waiting I was able to watch her journey come full circle.

As for the film itself, 9/10. I don’t know what else to say but that my expectations were met. From the cinematography, choreography, set and production design, to the performances by Rachel Zegler and Ariana DeBose, there’s simply so much to love about the WSS remake. I wholeheartedly believe Spielberg did the original justice. As for whether or not it surpassed the original, I think I’d have to watch it again. 2.5 hours went by so quickly in the theater.

The only factor preventing me from giving WSS a perfect 10/10 is Ansel Elgort and his existence. His chemistry with Rachel was passable, but every time they kissed, I felt slightly uncomfortable. Also, I couldn’t help but laugh when towards the end, when Valentina tells Tony that Chino shot Maria, his face that gets all sad. Although, there was something satisfying in seeing Tony die if you catch my drift.

I think my favorite choreographed sequences were “America” and “Cool.” “America” benefits a lot from the open streets compared to the confined rooftop of the original movie. The way Tony and Riff move in “Cool” was really...well, cool.

Vocal-wise, my favorites were “Balcony Scene (Tonight)” and “A Boy Like That/I Have Love.” My lord Rachel’s vocals were SO good.

Rita Moreno as Valentina actually had a larger part in this film that I thought she would. I knew she was a stand-in for the original Doc, but I’m not sure if I remember Doc being so close to Tony in the original. I thought that was really nice to see in the remake.",rcyr5c

Unsalvagable story honestly. Spielberg is a genius for making this film so damn good despite all that.

The one flaw with the actual adaption is the pointless updates to Anybody's character. Trans rep is fine, but that's not what that character needed. Anybody's issue was that their arc was to gain acceptance into a gang of racist rapists. Just the lowest scum of the Earth. Why did this movie treat their acceptance into this group as a satisfying character arc? The Jets are horrrible.

Yes, the original is problematic for a number of reasons: Natalie Wood, Sharks in brownface, etc. It is still a classic and works.

Just because you can remake a movie doesn't mean you should. My problems with this lie in Spielberg trying to ""fix"" this movie and Kushner's screenplay which tried to make a period piece woke. This is about one ethnic group against another ethnic group. It's not going to be politically correct no matter how hard you try.

The original stage musical and faithful film adaptation were tightly integrated and when you start to shift things around, it starts to fall apart.

I have a HUGE problem with taking Somewhere away from Tony and Maria and giving it to Rita Moreno. It messed up the emotional arc of the story. Yes, Rita is a treasure and she's great but this detracted instead of adding to the story. Somewhere is one of the most powerful anthems to love and when Tony and Maria sing it to each other, it's magic. Valentina singing it to a photography has little emotional connection and you're talking about the past instead of the future which is where the tragedy of the story is supposed to be. And Maria sings it to dying Tony which is now missing.

I found Ansel to be whelming. He doesn't have ""it"". The rest of the cast was refreshing and exciting. I thought America, Gee Officer Krupke, and Cool where improvements. The Dance number worked for me until Tony and Maria met. Then Spielberg blew it by having them go behind the bleachers instead of the original dream sequence where they meet in the middle of the empty dance floor. That's where the magic happens.

I'll take the original with all its flaws. It's an important piece of theatre and American movie history.

I can only hope justice can be done and Lin Manuel-Miranda can remake Schindler's List.",rcyr5c
ho80et7,"I absolutely loved it. The original was such a great movie and I was kinda meh about the idea of a remake of it when I saw that’s what Spielberg’s next movie was gonna be, but he definitely pulled it off. The moment I heard the whistle to open it I got so excited. He improved on the original in so many ways. All the main characters got more depth and backstory in this version, and the sets all felt deeper and richer. Rachel Zegler was magnificent but Ariana DeBose and Mike Faist stole the show. It was such an amazing film.",rcyr5c

The acting, the choreography, the cinematography. Everybody really brings it. I sometimes struggle with longer runtimes the older I get but this honestly flew by.

It took a while for to get into it (I kinda found it a bit hokey at first) and the love affair moved too fast and deep for me but I'm pretty sure that was the point.

That being said, this is definitely one of my faves from the Best Picture category at the Oscars (still have 4 to watch!). Even though I'm sad I wasn't able to catch this in theaters, the size and scale of this version isn't lost while watching at home. It's so clear that Spielberg put such passion and love from the original musical into this film. Can definitely see why Ariana DeBose got her Oscar nomination here too.

My only major critique is that the age difference between Ansel Elgort and Rachel Zegler is way too visible, so that can be pretty uncomfortable. Wish they'd a younger actor with a more Broadway-esque voice to play Tony instead and match Zegler.",rcyr5c
ho9ohf9,"I'm glad that so many agree that this is superior to the original, because it absolutely is. Just riveting performances by everyone besides Ansel, who was decent enough I suppose. I'd give it a very very solid 8.5/10, my 2nd favorite movie of the year behind only The Last Duel.",rcyr5c

hqch4uh,"Massively, Massively... Overrated. It dragged on for way way too long and showed that whilst Spielberg is the quintessential director of our time, he just has very little foray into the Musical Theatre space and it shows. 

2.5 Hours. It did not need to be that long.  The story was just dragged out as much as it could be and it was a casting nightmare. Ansel Elgort seriously? That scene where he's told of Maria's death I couldn't tell if he was mortified or having a migraine.

I've seen both the West End and also the recent Australian productions and those are well under 2 hours each, and honestly if you wanted to make this a better movie, I would have dumped the entire Australian cast in the roles and it would have been near on perfect.  

Rearranging the musical score as well did not fit the bill. I Feel Pretty goes near the start not the end, and that was simply done for dramatic effect to amplify the mood drop of Maria. 

Oh and for the love of god, not everyone in the world speaks Spanish. Hardcode some subtitles for real. 1/2 the movie was Spanish which is great for authenticity but what is the point when your viewers no habla espanol?

Chino was made out to be an utter weakling in this as well - something he wasn't in the stage productions. I had this creepy feeling he just wanted me to rub the lotion onto the skin the whole movie.

Was it entertaining, yes. Its still WSS after all.. but it fell well short of the mark and isn't Oscar material at all.",rcyr5c

hnyyrcx,"It's been awhile since I've seen the 1961 filmed version, but this one flew by for 156 minutes. Somehow though, I never really got a good sense of the love story between Tony and Maria. They lock eyes from across the room, she kisses him suddenly and abruptly, and then he is chasing her for the rest of the film, while she seems to somewhat rebuff him until he pleads and convinces her otherwise. When Bernardo dies, Tony doesn't even get a chance to explain his side to Maria before she already forgives him. It just feels like it's moving too fast for her to process her brother's death and accept what happened. All the musical set pieces were well staged, and the production felt very much like an old fashioned movie musical, which is nice for classic movie lovers, but I wonder how much others will get out of it. It really does just feel like an update of the 1961 film.

As others have mentioned, Rachel Zegler and Ariana DeBose are the two standouts of the film and were immensely watchable. I always loved West Side Story for the songs and romance, not the Sharks vs. Jets machismo, where the message always seemed to be violence begets violence, without any real sense of resolution. It really is a bummer of an ending.

Maybe my biggest disappointment is that they didn't take advantage of the PG-13 rating and change the lyrics to ""Gee, Officer Krupke, FUCK YOU!""",rcyr5c
hofknin,"I just got out of the theater. I really wanted to like it, but I cannot enjoy Ansel Elgort at all. I’m all for separating the art from the person, but he doesn’t have the charisma to pull it off. He comes across as a predator to me, and the plot of the movie kind of doesn’t help matters. (He’s a tall brooding man who just got out of prison.)

Also, as someone who had never seen the original, why does Chino really care about Bernardo at all? He acts like he wants to avenge his death, but I didn’t understand where he fits into the story. He didn’t seem that interested in Maria and he didn’t seem to be best friends with Bernardo, so why did he care about killing Tony?",rcyr5c

In the original film, they enter an almost dream like state where everything around them is out of focus.  They don't care about the other people, only each other in the moment.

In this one, they make the conscious decision to go behind the bleachers as to hide what they're doing.  It negates the ""blinded by love"" aspect of what the music and moment portrays.",rcyr5c

holye8y,"Really loved it! The performers were all fantastic, the choreography was phenomenal, the lead actor/actress had surprisingly amazing voices. 

My only complaint is that it felt like half of the dialogue was in Spanish without subtitles. I loved the scenes where they'd speak Spanish and then ""chide"" each other to practice in English, I thought it felt super natural, but other times it felt like entire scenes were spoken in Spanish with no explanation. As someone who's admittedly never seen West Side Story before it made it kind of confusing to follow the later half of the story.

Edit: just read the rest of the comments, I had no idea this was a controversy before the movie came out lol. To clairfy, I normally like Spanish/English mixed dialogue (In the Heights, for example), but it felt a little confusing in this particular instance for some reason.",rcyr5c

hpcbx24,"I love the new version as much as I love the original. The only part of the new that did not deliver for me is the first scene between Riff and Tony. I just didn't feel their bond was strong enough for Tony to kill later. I went back to the original and, even though it was shorter, I did feel that bond. I don't think it's because of the actors. I fee it's because Kushner and Spielberg introduced too many story points here: Tony's backstory, the neighborhood change, Valentina, Grazi, etc. They diluted the tension between Riff and Tony. 

Change the ""Cool"" song to a confrontation between Riff and Tony weaken their bond even more. It's gorgeously shot with excellent setting, lighting and movement. But the way the scene plays out, Tony goes to Riff to talk him out of the rumble. Riff shows his gun and Tony tries to take it away. Tony is dismissive of Riff, like he's a little kid who can't handle fire. At the end of it, Riff is on the side of the other Jets, who in the ""Jet Song"" all said Tony is no longer a member of the Jets. It feels like Riff can no longer say ""I know Tony like I know me, and I guarantee you can count him in.""

hydw3dw,Riff vs Bernardo fight reminded me of Indiana Jones days,rcyr5c
hz28nja,"From my point of view, Steven Spielberg has been in an artistic slump that began with the fourth Indiana Jones film.  The last project in his filmography to wow me was Munich.  Everything since then has ranged from middle of the road to merely good.  In that time, I have seen praise heaped upon Lincoln, Bridge of Spies, The Post and Ready Player One.  So, it's clear to me that not everyone shares my opinion that Spielberg is no longer at the height of his powers.

When I began hearing about West Side Story, I wasn't that interested.  I had pretty much lost my fandom for Hollywood's greatest director.  But, when I heard the glowing reception, I was initially skeptical but at the same time I couldn't help but have a little hope.  Maybe Spielberg really had been revitalized by a creative challenge and managed another triumph.  

Today, I got my chance to see Spielberg's West Side Story.  On a technical level, it is a brilliant piece of work.   I love the visual style he brought to the project.  As can be expected, Spielberg is a master of staging.  He has taken the music numbers and given them new life.  Just watch Tony and Maria interacting on a fire escape or Anita dancing in the streets with her fellow Puerto Ricans.  Those scenes and many others are masterfully staged.  

As can be expected from a Spielberg movie, the performances are excellent too.  Ariana DeBose, Rita Moreno, Rachel Zegler all stand out like shining beacons.  

So, this means that Spielberg is back, right?  Well, not so fast.  You see, for all of these wonderful elements, the whole thing just felt like an empty exercise in style.  And, Anson Elgort, while he wasn't terrible, he also wasn't what the film needed.  He was a flatline the entire time.  

I found myself entertained and dazzled by the presentation, it just felt like a nice effort by Spielberg but not something that could stand with his all-time greats.  This is not on the same level as E.T. or The Color Purple.  I use those two films as comparison because West Side Story is closest in tone and ambition with those films and not Schindler's List.

The score has even become part of the standard classical canon, with symphony orchestras treating it as sacredly as they would any Beethoven symphony.

But that’s not very convincing, and to be honest he played everything really flatly. I didn’t really buy a single emotion of his on screen. He had no charisma. Rachel Zegler shone on screen every time she was there. She owned the frame. 

I don’t think it’s a surprise though that Elgort struggles to play a leading man. Especially in a musical.",rcyr5c
hojkywp,"So this movie was good. Not amazing, but good. I definitely enjoyed it.

**What I liked:**

The actors were mostly great. Ariana DeBose was phenomenal, Rachel Zegler did great with what she had to work with (more on that later), David Alvarez really held his own. I was not as impressed with Ansel or Mike Faist as everyone else seems to be. I feel like there are other actors who could have fit in better, especially Ansel, whose face and looks just felt very out of place, although his voice was very good.

I like how they extracted the subtleties of the original and made them more blunt like the racial tensions, the gentrification of the neighborhood, the backstory of the Jets that show they aren't just random bigots and have a tragic motivation, and even the transgenderedness of Anybodys.

The choreography, costumes, make up and lighting were all visually stunning. I like the choice to go with the very saturated warm vs cool theme and the stage lighting motif. Cinematography wise many of the shots were shot from low angle, which I liked and gave the feeling you were watching people on a stage, but felt more could have been done with the camera in a musical.

**What I disliked:**

I was not a fan of the editing. There were some sloppy cuts and continuity goofs, including during the dance numbers.

I was also disappointed with the script adaptation. The movie should have been re-written extensively to keep it more up to date and fresh with modern values. Somehow Maria's character was flatter and more one-sided than the original film. She is still the stereotypical naive, foolish ingénue we see in musical theater from Christine Daaé  to Miss Saigon that feels extremely outdated by todays standards. The fact that she sleeps with Tony after he killed her brother is just silly. Some people actually laughed out loud in the theater at that. Maria's character could have been fleshed out and fuller but she still felt very Christine Daae, and Nutcracker Clara esque: just there to be pretty, suited and lead to the death of her suitor or herself. Some sloppy avoidable cringe moments like oversexualizing Anita by showing her talking about wanting to have sex with Bernardo with a wicked grin on her face while she's supposed to be praying in church and having the only black person in the cast be a gun trafficker and some other cringe worthy lines could have been better handled and added nothing to the story.

The instrumentation should have been updated as well. It sound exactly like it did 60 years ago and not in a good way. I wish they used more modern instruments and sound editing so it doesn't sound so much like an orchestra straight from the 1950s.

Some very odd casting choices as well. Rita Moreno's character felt forced into this. I would have been okay with her being ""Doc"" and not having so much dialogue and certainly not the solo somewhere, and I would have gone a different direction with Tony and Riff casting.",rcyr5c
hny9cto,Loved it but I almost burst out laughing at Ansel’s reaction to being told Maria was “dead”. I was so enamored by him in the beginning but by the end he became the weakest part of a very strong film so that’s not saying much.,rcyr5c
hotn8yj,"The movie/musical is wonderful however I have a serious issue with the plot. The Jets are white supremacists who harass and attack minorities. The Sharks literally exist to protect their community. This isn’t a “both sides are bad” issue. Only one side is bad.
The idea that Maria is overlooking the fact that Tony was (is?) a racist, plus the fact that he murdered her brother, plus the fact that the Jets rape Anita is actually disgraceful. It’s to the point where her actual “love” for Tony seems more like a complete lack of self respect, pride, and semblance of dignity. It’s especially ridiculous when the events of the entire musical takes place over two days.

Plot aside, they could have gotten a much better actor and singer to play Tony. The rest of the cast was pretty good. And Ariana Debose as Anita was phenomenal.",rcyr5c
hofypnx,Wtf are people smoking in this thread? This wasn't a bad movie but it's not incredible either. What's at play here? Nostalgia?,rcyr5c
hoew7oy,"Meh, what a lame movie. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind long films, but only if there’s more action scenes.  
The camerawork was so boring, always at ground level and never flying around (not that any characters did any flying around either, tsk). Spielburg has all these CGI tools, yet he didn’t use them. The final rumble was so boring. Nobody used their superpowers. Nobody got kicked or thrown through any walls, and not a single building was demolished. There were no sky beams.  
I think there was a problem with the projector (admittedly not Spielburgers fault) as all the lines were wonky, and annoying blue streaks everywhere. I was also really disappointed in the Anita multi-verse, they should have had a big boss battle in the store, and it blow up afterwards. But the CGI de-aging of Anita was pretty good, to be fair.  
I think it was obvious they’re setting up a Tony origin movie later down the line, but it would also be good to see Tony and Bernardo back in the sequel. I reckon they’d end up teaming up-just a hunch I have….  
I had to rush out as soon as the credits started rolling-would anyone care to put in spoiler tags, the end credit scene? I’d be much obliged!",rcyr5c
ho147dd,"As a stand-alone movie perspective is fun and incredibly well made,  But as a from the perspective remake, I'd say it's pointless, as it adds nothing new to justify it's existence or why this movie needed to be remade.  Why do we need this story retold to us in 2021? Because outside of actually casting Hispanics, This is literally just the original movie just with a new coat of paint.

  
  In my opinion, it was a mistake to make this a traditional faithful adaption, Because  as i said it makes this remake feel pointless,  and would been in the spirt of the musical and what it's supposed to be.  That being  contemporary musical retelling of Remo and Julliet for Teenagers and young adults, (like the 50s equivalent of  Dear Even Hanson or The Prom )    


I firmly believe the way they should have done is done what an off-broadway version, set this in modern-day, Break form tradition has a more Hip hop choreography, have the tone be darker, have the cinematography like Moonlight or Waves. 

  
Because  
 A:Would have justified this movie being remade.

  
B: Been in the spirt of what this movie is trying to accomplish 

  
C:  but it would have made it's a message on racism more impactful explained to the audience why this story still matters..  Because keeping it in the 1950s, basically is saying indirectly that these issues are in the past, and we are reflecting on the past,   
In short, what was the point of this being remade, if Steven Spielberg isn't adding anything new, and that the original didn't do just as well already?

People who praised the director's work here are either victims of mass hypnosis, rely on the same dealer who that week had bad drugs or were looking at it not as it is but from some nostalgic dream. It was visually ugly and lifeless. I think all dance musicals put on screen are actually atrocious, and only garner praise because it is somehow artistic expression at its finest seeing actors who aren't dancers or signers, do what they have no training in.

Just an all-around congratulations to everyone involved in making this film, which was incredibly professional, creative, and deeply emotional. The choreography was top-notch, the music was excellent, and MOST of the performances were stellar also, with Rachel Zegler as Maria the clear shining star of the bunch.

The only one who left me feeling meh was Ansel Elgort. Some people can sing, and some people can *SING*. Ansel can sing. Without the caps or italics. And compared to the extraordinary talent and professionalism of the rest of the cast, his mediocre performance sticks out like a sore thumb. He didn't come close to ruining the movie, but man, he was not good. Steven Spielberg could have launched the career of someone with actual singing chops but for some reason cast that sack of potatoes instead. Bleh.

Also, can I just say, as someone who didn't know the story before watching this... If you met someone one night, and then that person KILLED YOUR BROTHER a *day later*, there are a lot of ways you'd react to that, but, if we were to rank the things that could happen in order of likelihood, I would tend to think that ""falling hopelessly in love with him"" would be pretty fucking low on the list.",rcyr5c

With that said I have to knock it a little though personally due to no subtitles. I know a large portion of people liked the no subtitles but it frustrates me because I feel like I may have missed important stuff due to it not being there.

His singing was decent but his dancing was atrocious. His acting was mediocre like it always is. Even the guy who played Chino was better than Elgert. The ""Cool"" number with Riff/Tony was awful because of how bad Elgort was in it. 7/10 movie. Pre-2000s Spielberg still remains supreme",rcyr5c

Was Valentina not meant to sing Somewhere in this version? 
What are the differences between original and this version, and is it better this way? 

As someone who didn’t LOVE it maybe I couldn’t (even as a romantic) entirely get on board without more exposition and get behind the epic love story when they merely danced together. But visually and musically it was *beautiful*. I agree with the consensus seemingly that maybe Ansel wasn’t the right lead, but Anita and Griff for me was *chef kiss* .

hzin155,This movie was great the first 40 minutes then it dragged on. I don’t understand why this movie is 2 hours long? The first one was just an hour. Ansel elgort and maria( don’t know the actress name) had little to know chemistry. It felt like they were friends more than anything. This movie was exactly like the original very few if any changes. The choreography and cinematography were great as well as the actors but I think the original is still better 7/10,rcyr5c
hzxniqp,"Overall really liked it a lot. All the technical stuff is amazing and while some songs i was eh on the choreography and visuals kept me interested in most of them. For her first role Rachel did a really great job as Maria. Pretty much everyone did, except Ansel. 

Some criticisms is again for being one of the leads Ansel was just...there most of the time. The sadder or angrier stuff he did fine with but all the romantic scenes might as well put a tennis ball there with how much heavy lifting Rachel did. It's just unfortunate because everyone did a really good job and there was a big weak spot in Tony. Also the last act, or whatever you'd call everything after the Rumble, is pretty eh. I think there's just too many big leaps for it to work, especially how the Jets almost gang rape Anita. Most of the movie i felt like Spielberg leaned towards the Sharks but still made sure to give the Jets a fair shake but then that happens and like 10 minutes later it's all ""Sharks and Jets put aside their differences."" It's a problem i have with all the versions of WSS and i don't think it's ever worked",rcyr5c

In a cinema climate where so much feels so corporate and profits-motivated, you can just *feel* the joy in the filmmaking in this. Martin Scorsese’s *Silence*, Peter Jackson’s LOTR trilogy and *King Kong*, Damien Chazelle’s *La La Land*, and Denis Villenueve’s *Dune* have the same feel, and those are all “passion projects”.

Bernardo isn't blameless either, he killed Riff. So it's less Tony killed my brother, and more this tragedy occurred and Tony was the last man standing.

I actually think Spielberg not doing the original song trick is going to give a boost to Rachel Zegler's Oscar chances. Not sure if the score is going to be eligible or not, but the Globes and Critics Choices didn't nominate it, so maybe not. Awarding Rachel may become the de facto way to honor the movie's music, since Maria's part is synonymous with the central song, Tonight.

Having said that, I was never comfortable with the 'attempted rape' scene being in any of the WSS movies.

I saw a revival of WWS on broadway directed by the original stage director/choreographer Jerome Robbins- and its hard to even put in words what a work of genius it was just in terms of staging - the way one scene flowed into another with scenery and choreography - it was like a dream.

The original WWS film is really a different animal (Robbins did most of the choreographer but was fired as co-director, apparently because he was an asshole as a person). In both the stage and original film versions Tony and Maria bland and Anita (Rita Moreno and in the theater version I saw, Debbie Allen) were the memorable ones.

Overall, I feel this musical crosses over for non-musical fans almost as well as Beauty and the Beast. Their songs seem to be a similar mix of comedy, romance, character development and action-oriented songs. I think you could make a lot of parallels between their soundtracks. Officer Krupke is a lot like Gaston's song (comedy about villains' bad behavior). The Tonight Quintet is like Kill the Beast (action song leading up to big battle). I Feel Pretty is like Something There (woman explains how she's falling in love). America is like Be Our Guest (the side characters steal the show with a cheerful group tune). The Jet Song is like Belle (opens the movie and establishes characters while traversing the city). And the BATB theme is like Tonight (core love theme).

Yeah, I thought Dune had a lock on the technical, sound, design Oscars but WSS may have stolen most of those. It might have to settle for visual effects and, ironically, score, since I don't think WSS is eligible for any music awards (must be original). WSS would be winning Best Picture if it wasn't a remake. It'll be nominated in large part because of its visuals, which are not derivative of the original film much at all.",rcyr5c

Natalie Wood as Maria was allowed to portray prolonged moments of grief and actually faced Tony with despair & anger as he appears at the window. She violently hits him and screams ""killer!"" and the only thing that calms her is hearing that he did it on impulse after watching Bernardo kill Riff. 

Then 'Somewhere' is sang by Tony and Maria as a lovers' duet, which was also ruined by the 2021 version as it's bizarrely given to Moreno's character... I guess as an excuse to give her a bigger role because Rita selfishly complained that she ""doesn't do cameos.""",rcyr5c

The only point is that they're in love enough to be blinded by it to any other issues. The movie knows Tony has to pay for what he did in the end, and delivers that. Maria doesn't have to believe that. Anita didn't exactly allow it. She said Maria would have to leave and never come back if she wanted to be with Tony.

To have Rita Moreno (of all people) dictate the Jets' moral compasses and be their personal lecturer on the topic of rape unfortunately proves that Tony Kushner was informed to write the script with Moreno's wishes in mind. It's hard to see past that knowledge when watching it. Moreno wanted Anita at the forefront of the drama/action and she wanted the white boy gang to be humiliated. I personally always felt that the rape attempt was a step too far in the 1961 movie too, like how did these boys (who were afraid of the prospect of knife fights) suddenly get the courage to be so cruel and vicious? Especially Baby John, the most innocent gang member you could ever witness.

Like you said, the major problem is how they show the boys deeply upset afterwards. It's all a very rushed and convenient method of showing that Tony and Maria's teen love could somehow work miracles. How come some angry words from Maria and Valentina could do that but Tony's constant words to Riff that he wanted to be different for Maria made no impact whatsoever? They had known Tony since they were kids. Again, the writing always kind of fell flat in this area.

i0huj4f,"Tony is not devoted to a hate group. He kills Bernardo because Bernardo killed Riff, who is like his brother, and he feels guilty about it because Riff's death was indirectly and accidentally his fault too. Just like Romeo kills Tybalt after Tybalt kills Mercutio. If Tony were a hater, he wouldn't fall in love with Maria and actually try to make peace between the Sharks and the Jets.  And, no, the 2021 version doesn't side with the Sharks. On  the contrary, it shows the Jets are as much victims of the ""system"" as the Sharks, in fact, as Tony tells Maria in the subway, even more so because, unlike the Puerto Ricans, they don't have structured families and an American dream.  The Jets, as Lieutenant Schrank put it,  are actually the last ""can't make it Caucasians"", whose parents and grandparents, also immigrants themselves, already blew their ""American dream"" and failed to move out of the slums.  Kushner and Spielberg do make the Jets more explicitly racist though in the Prologue (compared to the original), which in my opinion was uncalled for.

Besides, don't forget that Riff fights Bernardo because Tony wouldn't fight him (again the same reason why Mercutio fights Tybalt). The 2021 film makes that point clearer than the 1961 version as it shows that Tony (""a big Polack"") could have killed Bernardo with his bare hands and, in fact, was close to doing it, but then quit figthing.",rcyr5c

hpb1z3z,I agree with you that having Ice present in the attempted rape scene of the 2021 movie is a major NOPE. He was basically Riff's second-in-command and I think it spoke for itself that Riff would never have approved of sexually attacking an innocent woman (based on how well he treated his girlfriend Graziella) and so to have Ice there really shows a lack of care by Spielberg and Kushner towards the knowledge that a Jets leader would not condone those actions.,rcyr5c

hpb3wmi,"1) The Jets didn't rape Anita. Graziella and Valentina intervened to ensure that would not happen. The scene was more about them scaring the girlfriend of the man who killed their leader. They took their anger out on the wrong person for sure, but their judgment was obviously going to be compromised when it came to the girlfriend of their enemy because they had literally just witnessed Bernardo kill their best friend and leader, Riff.

2) The racism is more heavily depicted on the Jets' side (particularly with that ridiculous in-your-face stupid moment of them vandalizing the Puerto Rican flag), but it is NOT just coming from the Jets. The Sharks were shown to be racist themselves, using the terms ""Gringo"" and ""Polack"". It may have flown over your head, but the Jets all have Irish, Italian and Polish immigrant blood.

3) Maria's super-quick love for Tony is a modern-day take on Romeo & Juliet, so of course she's gonna do some dumb things that don't make sense in a modern era. Sleeping with him, well I guess that was just an excuse to allow the pair some quick passion before one of them tragically dies.

(I think Kushner has similar lines about Jews in Angels in America.:)) 

But that's not how I felt with the original movie. With the original I felt it's a neighborhood very much in flux and the (gang) territory very much in contention. 

I know S/K tried to add historical context to the story because Lincoln Center was built on some kind of ""slum."" But I think it was mostly an African American neighborhood. So in that sense, painting that neighborhood as Hispanic/PR would also not be correct. But I don't know enough of history to make that judgment.

The scariest part though is to see that little has actually changed for kids like the Jets in 60 years!  I also agree about Cool (2021) being the superior version , especially with the added context of Riff buying the gun and again the different setting and circumstances of the scene.

For all the other numbers, I think the original was way better. You forgot to mention the Prologue, which is also much worse in the 2021 scene than in the 1961 version.  The Jets for example were never a hate group, so I don't know why they have to deface a mural with the Puerto Rican flag or pull down a sign in Spanish that was covering an older Irish pub sign.

The Jets are a teenage gang and, as all teenagers, they gather in cliques. There is racial tension between the Jets and the Sharks, whom the Jets perceive as being ""different"" from them in a cultural (and ""skin color"") sense and is very likely that they would use racial slurs (just as Bernardo also directs racial slurs at Tony for example), but the Jets are not neo-Nazis (in fact, there are even Jewish kids who are Jets). Their quarrel with the Sharks, albeit with racist undertones, is more about control of territory than about race, and not different in this sense from their past fights with the Emeralds and the Kings.

You are not supposed to accept or empathize with Maria's (or Juliet's) actions. It is a tragedy where the outcomes are actually a result of the flaws (not the virtue) of the characters, although Shakespeare subverts it somewhat by making Romeo and Juliet's death a product of chance, which is somewhat true also for Tony's death in WSS.  In any case, both Tony and Maria are punished in the end for their lust if you want to describe it in those terms.",rcyr5c
i0ly8cy,"> f the cast, I guess. There is no chemistry between Tony and Maria (Ansel in particular is too wooden in his acting). Mike Faist is a talented dancer and singer, but he looks nothing like a Riff. As an audiemce, I didn't feel the deaths of Riff, Bernardo and Tony as I felt in the original 1961 film. Rita Moreno's role as Doc's replacement is also underwhelming. Justin Peck's choreography is more complex than the original version by Jerome Robbins, but it feels artificial and out of place. Honestly, I don't see any compelling reason for this remake (unlike Villeneuve's Dune for example, which was badly needed after David Lynch's 1984 fiasco).

In a *great* production, the performances make you believe the story anyways, beyond logic and reason. You buy into the love that keeps these two together. That through love, Maria somehow convinces Anita, for an hour, to help the man who *murdered her true love* escape with her (basically) little sister. It's so unbelievable, the fact that it can get you to suspend your disbelief for just a few minutes is what makes the tragedy come crashing down so hard. Because the love should never have gotten them so far. In reality, it would have been snuffed out at the dance.  


  
 I've seen a couple of *Romeo and Juliet's* that convinced me. I've seen 1 production of West Side Story that took me on that ride.

They could have easily fixed this by at the dance having them meet behind the bleachers, where we find out their romance started way, way before, but this night now was the first time they were actually caught.

hp9hke6,"I've wrestled with both West Side Story and Romeo and Juliet for a long time because of the whole time frame issue and the Bernardo/Tybalt murder. I've made my peace with it in my own ways, but tbh I think it just works for some ppl and not for others. Nevertheless, I'll try and pitch it to you. Stay with me a second cuz this is all over the place.

A lot of Shakespeare plays, especially the tragedies, follow Aristotle's conventions for plays that he outlined in his Poetics. I barely remember most of them, but he used Oedipus Rex as a prime example of a good play, specifically a good tragedy, because of its focus: to maximize the tragedy, it took place in the same setting within a day with no subplots, all of which made the tragedy of the story much more acute; rather than stretch it out with more time or storylines with new locations and have the main story lose focus, it's just a relentless hammering in of that central tragedy. 

Some Shakespeare tragedies have a similar structure: Othello and Macbeth are two that immediately come to mind. While Romeo and Juliet and WSS both have other subplots and such, they really rely on the short time frame (and the age of their characters) to emphasize how overwhelmingly passionate the characters are. And not just romantically: the killings of Tybalt and Bernardo, much like the two whirlwind romances, are incredibly spur of the moment, caused by an outburst of passion from very young and hormonal teenagers with a lot of rage. The characters of WSS also have a lot of love in their hearts, but they rarely get the chance to express it, nor do they often receive it; that every character has absent parents is very telling about the lack of affection they receive, which only adds to the intensity of feeling between Tony and Maria.

So, the narrow time frame and Maria's age really throw her for a loop; she is grieving deeply when she learns of Bernardo's death, but at the same time the only person she really wants to share that vulnerability with is her brother's killer. Yes, she feels incredible grief, but she still feels incredible love for Tony: to lose both Bernardo and Tony would be too much for her (his death breaks her at the end), and so she can't let him leave despite what he did. It's kind of whacko, but teenagers often are lol: the combination of adolescence, the magnitude of events (that moment of love at first sight, which is swiftly followed by multiple deaths), and how quickly they stack up is overwhelming for Maria. Much like Juliet at the end of the play, she doesn't know what she ought to do but she doesn't want to be alone; so, in spite of everything, she chooses Tony.",rcyr5c

hofpw5m,"Deus ex ""across the room."" Pretty characteristic of a lot of young love plots until realism kicks in post 19th Century. (Sudden love cuts out all the time-consuming courtship dance.)

hofywom,"Right. It works for a guy who just got out of a NY state prison after a year. (Trying to make himself a cypher inside.) It just doesn't work as well for the ""love at first sight."" I think we needed to see a little bit of Tony, the raging badass gang leader, earlier, maybe in his first confrontation with Riff.  In the play and the film his emotions and motivations don't matter so much because it is really a NY music/dance riff on R & J, but with the more realistic gang fighting in this production, a passive Tony becomes a problem until that rage comes out as he is beating Bernardo. (In a college production we did, the actor playing Tony  was an ex-marine returning to school. His underlying gruffness made all the difference.) It would have made this film waaay too long, but I wonder if it would have helped if Tony had *just* come back from prison, the Jets clearly respected and feared him, and there was a scene where Docs wife took him in and gave him a job. He would be raw.  The dance at the gym would be just like prison (constant conflict, turf wars), but then he sees an angel and he doesn't know what to do.",rcyr5c

This was the first time I can remember feeling like it was just a little too much, it felt like there were entire sections of dialogue in Spanish and since I wasn't super familiar with the story I felt a little lost. The scene where Maria and her brother argue about Maria dancing with Tony comes to mind.

The musical and the film were groundbreaking for the time, the choreography by Robbins was mind blowing and basically the guidebook for the choreography of this movie 50 years later. Bernstein's music and Sondheim's lyrics being paired may never be matched again (and Spielberg used the music almost without alteration).

Spielberg did a good job of updating the movie making techniques, of converting the story into more gritty realism which is what viewers are used to now, and taking advantage of the technical advancements in equipment and lighting and sets that 60 years and 200 million dollars will get you...but he's simply standing on the shoulders of giants.

Bernardo stabbed Riff during a brawl, it’s bad but you can kinda argue it as self defense. You can also see Bernardo was surprised to see what he did too. Tony, who portrayed himself as a “reformed” person just got up and killed Bernardo senselessly as an act of revenge. Not quite the same IMO.

The result of that was that a mixed race actress was denied the ability to receive her award on stage, the way that Julie Andrews did in 1964, another singer/actress who won the statue for her debut role in a movie musical.

htp3r62,"I'm going to defend the suddenness of the romance in both adaptations mostly because the absolutely glorious 1968 *Romeo & Juliet* film made me fall in love with the story after years. It's an adaptation that finally helped me 'get' the story.

It's first worth noting that Shakespeare took inspiration from an Italian poem *The Tragical History of Romeus & Juliet* \- and in that, the romance unfolded over a period of a few months. But Shakespeare changed many things. While a romance unfolding over months might be more 'realistic' (never mind that there are people who fall in love and get together very quickly in real life), the suddenness of it is necessary for the story. And I'm not talking about these revisionist takes where people think the point of the story is ""these stupid kids should have known better"".

*Romeo & Juliet* is presented to the audience as a tragedy from the very first scene. The opening lines tell us that Romeo and Juliet are going to die. So every romantic scene between them in the play is meant to be somewhat ironic because, for every kiss or sweet balcony scene, the audience already knows these two are going to die. And Romeo and Juliet have to die for the story to work. The message is not ""don't mistake lust for love"" and it's not shaming the teenagers for their hormones. 

Verona is basically a warzone, with characters regularly stabbing each other to death in the streets all because of a feud that's been going on so long no one even knows why these families hate each other. The older generation create this world, and the young inherit it and keep it going because that's what they're taught. The first scene in Verona starts with a bunch of kids getting into a fight, and when Lords Capulet and Montague hear what's happening, they want to join in! When Tybalt is killed, Lady Capulet is calling for Romeo's blood, even though Tybalt himself was a murderer. And Juliet's parents force their thirteen-year-old into a marriage with an older man she's never met to get the family wealth or political favour, as opposed to y'know, marrying into the other prosperous family in the area.  Lord Capulet is also likely thinking that, because he's still quick to join in the fights, he could be killed tomorrow and thus his daughter better be married to ensure the future of his estate. None of which would be an issue if there wasn't a feud going on, or child marriage wasn't a thing.

Everything in Verona happens quickly because of this heightened tension every day. Emotions are running high because there is the very real possibility of getting killed in the street that afternoon. Romeo and Juliet meet at a party and fall for each other. But because of the feud, they have to keep everything secret. It's not just disapproval from their parents - Tybalt was ready to kill Romeo for simply being AT the Capulets' party, he'd probably decapitate him! So these youngsters are forced into a situation where it's certain death if they follow their hearts, and while it might be 'smarter' to follow the rules, they being rebellious teenagers chose the former (although the feud had been ordered ended on pain of death earlier that day, so they may have thought they'd have a chance). The rules being so strict is what made them act so rashly. Fear and tension make people do impulsive things all the time, especially when there's no way to express emotions healthily - Romeo and Juliet can't just have a courtship period of a few months to see if they'd be a good match.

And the point, and REAL tragedy of R&J, is that these kids couldn't just BE kids because of their environment. Juliet in particular is forced into marrying a man at least ten years her senior or the family is ruined (if they discover she's married Romeo in secret, she's screwed in many severe ways). The 1968 film plays this brilliantly, where Juliet begging to delay the marriage for even a week is met with violence from her father and even the Nurse is terrified to go against his wishes afterwards. And Romeo is friggin exiled from his home all because of one mistake made in the heat of the moment. Their romance is short-lived because it never had the chance to be anything else in the world they were born into, and their elders have allowed to continue existing.

The Prince tries to order the feud ended with the death penalty, but the play demonstrates that just the threat of punishment isn't enough to quell the hate. It takes one big tragic reality check to do that. Lady Montague dies off stage for whatever reason (she's a minor character so it could be anything from guilt or just plain sadness), and Lord Montague realises he's lost his only son and his two best friends (the quarto says Benvolio dies too, and he's Romeo's cousin, so that's another dead kid in the family). The Nurse realises that she failed her mistress when she needed her the most out of fear (if she'd helped Juliet escape or do something, her and Romeo might have lived). The Capulets realise that they f'd up so much as parents that their daughter felt her only option was to make them think she was dead so she could escape from them (and in their last conversation, they threatened her and Lord Capulet says he wishes she'd NEVER BEEN BORN). Their suicides aren't just to be with the other - Romeo is grieving for his murdered friend and his own guilt that he's just killed two people (the text outright says he views his own suicide as penance for killing Tybalt and Paris). Juliet is likewise better off dead than alive, since she's looking at hellish consequences from families of all three bodies she wakes up to see herself surrounded by (Shakespeare changed her age from 16-18 in the poem to 13-14 in the play to make a statement about how awful child marriage was). Due to the massive change in women's rights between then and the 20th century, this is why Maria is spared in *West Side Story.*

Everyone in Verona realises that they were all responsible for Romeo and Juliet's suicides, as well as the other bloodshed. Not one person was at fault. It was the system that perpetuated this hate, and they were all complicit in some way. And the people who had the power to do something did nothing, and that led to more death and sorrow. That's why the Prince says ""all are punished"". So the tragedy isn't that it was a long and deep romance that couldn't last, but that it was one that had only just begun and didn't get the chance to do anything else. It's this that's the last straw that convinces everyone to stop the feuding. Sure back then, and even in the 50s, it mattered more how much stage time the lovers got than how long they'd known each other in the script - but the above is the angle Zeffirelli and now Spielberg took. 

Tony and Maria meet and make a connection, and they're driven to do what they do by their environment. They make mistakes that normal kids shouldn't have to make, and the other characters realise just what they've been perpetuating. The tragedy of the double suicides here is translated to both the Jets and Sharks realising that their actions saw this poor young woman having her heart completely broken, losing her brother and having to watch another man die in front of her. The Sharks in this version also see two of their number lose promising futures for the sake of gang violence, and I like to believe the Jets are also being hit with guilt at what they did to Anita (most of them look very ashamed when Valentina calls them on it). And this is all because two kids liked each other and wanted to date, but felt they had to run away together to even give themselves a chance - and that's a chance they don't get; they don't get to spend months getting to know each other, try living together, eventually have a family or even have a messy breakup and move on to someone they can have a future with (Tony doesn't even get to grow old, and who even knows what Maria will do now). So that's why the romance in R&J and WSS has to be short and whirlwind.

TL;DR - it's not a manual on how to have a healthy, functioning relationship. It's a warning on what hate can result in if it's needlessly passed down and continued.",rcyr5c
ho8judx,So like real life then. Chad wins.,rcyr5c

ho0e6fj,"And plus in many Shakespeare plays, and plays in general,  the plot is breakneck. So things need to happen FAST. Though I will say that there are soliloquies about how a character feel about things. Or songs to show that in a musical. 

Surprised there wasn't one in this movie?",rcyr5c
hnykurq,Also I highly doubt we would want to watch a movie where the romance is slow because the romance is obviously a big plot in the movie. But it's not the theme of the movie which is: Violence is wrong and so is being racist. We should all look at human lives as precious and shouldn't fight over stupid things like land they don't own.,rcyr5c

hp9iai5,"Ariana DeBose is a serious threat for Best Supporting Actress, I'd say. Movie is probably going to hit Best Picture, maybe Director and Screenplay; it won't win any, but it has a good shot at the tech categories. Costume and production design, makeup and hairstyling, cinematography, etc. Idk what the landscape is looking like for those tech categories, but unless I'm forgetting something already super acclaimed, I think it's going to be a frontrunner for costume design.",rcyr5c
hpnwiv7,"Easily, it'll get a ton of noms. Best Costume design, Best Supporting Actress / Actor and Best Actress will all get noms at the very least. I could see Director, Screenplay and Best Picture too.",rcyr5c
ho7wj8s,"Tony didn’t accidentally kill him though, he straight up stabbed Bernardo. What’s kind of ridiculous though is how Tony is traumatized after NEARLY beating a guy to death and being sent to jail. However he’s totally ok with stabbing a guy to death. In fact, he’s so ok with it, that he decides to sleep with the guys sister immediately after the fact and even hatches a getaway plan.",rcyr5c
hofu8za,"Probably they were trying to build tension as the rumble murders lead to a series of betrayals (a great improvement over the friars in R & J).  I think they wanted some real motivation for Chino going after Tony -- almost entirely unmotivated in the play and earlier film. Chino was dumped by Maria after Bernardo (the one guy probably looking after Chino in the community) set him up with her for the dance. He's crushed. Bernardo didn't want him at the rumble, but Chino wanted to demonstrate his ""manhood"" (not an unusual reaction from a bookish guy in a tough neighborhood). When Tony kills Bernardo, he goes to tell Maria, but all she initially wants to know is whether Tony is OK. This sequence allows Chino to react to the combined loss of Maria and Bernardo, and puts him in the ""killer zone.""",rcyr5c
ho0ecpt,Ahh so that was missing from this movie. That's an odd choice.,rcyr5c
ho7k9wz,Chino included the explanation in this version as well.,rcyr5c
ho0lns7,"No, not really beat by beat. The ending is almost completely different, WSS aged them up a bit iirc (which makes actions less understandable), they basically cut Rosalind (imo an important part of story), the squabble not petty family drama and instead made it racists versus oppressed community which changes a lot in subtle ways.

Honestly, just as an adaption of Romeo and Juliet, it's really unfaithful to both the events and the spirit of the play.",rcyr5c
i0c1rfc,"And he and Juliet don't get that moment of being together right before one of them dies, which is 1000x more heartbreaking. She's knocked out from the drugs, so he thinks she's for real dead and kills himself, she wakes up, finds him dead, kills herself. So frustrating.",rcyr5c
hq4q7l4,"They kept the story the same, but they added a lot of small things that I think really contributed to the depth of the story and raised the stakes. Tony never had much of a back story before now, and even Riff got some story added. We get the added layer of gentrification (with the Lincoln Center, no less!) on top of seeing the generational poverty and crime, especially during the gun-purchasing scene. Valentina is an infinitely more interesting character than Doc. They gave that moment of collaboration to Tony and Chino, and they widened the rift between Tony and his old gang. We got to see the Puertorriqueñas working in service of rich white people, we got to see the block party break out during ""America,"" kids and all, and Bernardo's gang in the boxing ring after the rumble. They actually toned down Shrank's racism, but they kept the police as the institutional protector of the rich and white status quo while humanizing Krupke in a couple of moments. Everything they added had a purpose and elevated the story for the better.",rcyr5c
hoh5tf1,"Enjoy :) While I think the new one is superior, the original film is still brilliant. It won an Oscar for best picture, after all",rcyr5c

hvvset4,"I like the background they added for Tony with him going to prison and all; it provided a lot more context to his reluctance to get involved in anything.  

I also really liked that they spent a little more time making Chino an actual character.  The actor did a great job, he was kind of adorable and I felt bad for him this time around.  In the original he's just kind of like a mannequin for most of the movie.",rcyr5c
i3ccd0u,"I liked the grittier Tony, even if he was a bit wooden in some places.",rcyr5c
hopjd6m,"Two ideas:

1. WSS is based on Romeo & Julilet. After the two are dead, their deaths bring both houses together. The carrying of the body by both sides could be due to that 
2. The Sharks felt guilty because they felt Chino took things too far.",rcyr5c
hoiw1s3,"Yeah, Natalie Wood delivered it a bit better. She said something like ""they weren't killed by guns or knives but by hate. And I can kill now because I have hate"" Really intense",rcyr5c
ho4cqy2,"And how do they get redeemed? The only good thing about the ending is that maybe the Sharks and Jets stop fighting, but otherwise they may be arrested in relation to their involvement in the rumble and their neighborhood is still going to change. It's a bummer ending for everyone.",rcyr5c

hxg1j5t,"Late to the party but yes I appreciated this added detail. In a lot of ways Bernardo made Maria’s life a little worse and he acted more like a guardian than a brother.

Whereas in the original film I was baffled at Maria’s reaction to Tony killing Bernardo. It was always a sore point in the movie for me that kind of ruins the experience because I hated *Maria* for reacting this way since in the original adaptation her and Bernardo were extremely close siblings. But in this remake I actually empathized with Maria since Bernardo (and Riff) got it coming and there was a sense of despair at the entire shitty situation where it felt like both deaths were inevitable.",rcyr5c

I may be a sap but I was hoping Tony and Maria would get away.  Maria did nothing wrong. Tony was trying to stop it all, he learned from past mistakes.  Maybe it’d be a little too perfect of an ending for them to be able to run away together, and what happened is a more interesting ending.",rcyr5c

DC film critics shut out WSS completely, also giving Supporting to Aunjanue Ellis and Actress to Kristen Stewart (probably Rachel's main competition). They had Rachel nominated under Youth Performance, but didn't win. Detroit critics gave Ariana the win and didn't even nominate Rachel. Their Actress winner was Jessica Chastain. Rachel gets put into that Young Performer category by a lot of critics but of course Oscars don't work that way.

I think Rachel's stock goes up if they take her singing into account as part of her performance. She's more impressive than Ariana on that front. Personally, I don't get the hype over Ariana's performance. Her dancing was the most impressive thing she did I think.",rcyr5c

hpbjetz,"Tony clearly killed Bernardo in a moment of heartbreak & pure madness. It was an instinctive reaction to seeing the guy take the life of his best friend. He certainly didn't go to the rumble with the intention to hurt anybody, and that immediately sets him apart from the gangs who DID intend to cause harm. The moments after Tony kills him, you see the pain and regret wash over him. He knows he and Maria don't stand a chance anymore.

As for Valentina giving shelter to the Jets, well they're the closest thing to family that Tony had and she's fully aware of this. They're young boys without proper parental figures to teach them right from wrong. She certainly doesn't approve of what they do to Anita, and I doubt she'll give most of them the time of day after the movie ends because she was only really a mother figure to the now-deceased Tony.",rcyr5c
hpco31r,"Maybe she wanted to give Anita a head start getting home before letting them out of the shop. XD

Tony made a mistake and he paid the price narratively for it. Nevertheless, there is enough sympathy there based on Bernardo antagonizing him constantly, and him just witnessing his friend get killed by him. So this would qualify as a heat of passion defense.

Heat of passion is a recognized defense against charges of 1st and 2nd degree murder. ... Heat of passion is a mental state provoked by fear, rage, anger or terror that, combined with adequate provocation, is a defense to the crimes of first and second degree murder.May 31, 2019",rcyr5c
homt04k,"His rationale was in part that English and Spanish are both considered ""native"" languages in the U.S. But that falls apart in other countries. By not subtitling Spanish universally in all countries, he's suggesting the story is only meant to be experienced by English speakers, because he's trying to replicate the feeling of only knowing English in all the other audiences. That seems rather non-inclusive when your movie isn't designed to play to Spanish-speaking audiences the same way as other audiences.",rcyr5c

I also really vibed with the music, but that part is wholly personal preference.

WSS feels much more like a straight musical, and I thought the plot was nonsensical and wholly depressing, felt like the second half was just made to try to get you to cry, I was just trying not to laugh at the absurdity of it. I felt like a lot of the characters were extremely one-dimensional. And it was incredibly overlong.",rcyr5c

My feeling with West Side Story was that they want to provide commentary on social aspects, and thus pulled it close to our reality and what we know. Because it is so closely linked to what we've experienced it is slightly discomforting to have a realistic aspect like that be accompanied by the nonsensical relationship between the main characters.

At least, these are the mental gymnastics I pull to say that Romeo and Juliet can get away with some similar stuff.

Edit: and also, that it happened in Romeo and Juliet doesn't necessarily mean it had to happen in West Side Story. The writers could have given their own spin on it in order to make it more believable.",rcyr5c

It's not a great song and it didn't fit in the score and it makes sense that they cut it, but it is a pretty good view into how the role was initially conceived. You can hear it [here](https://youtu.be/s8nIck-Ydx4) beginning around the 6 minute mark if you want.",rcyr5c

The dynamic changes when he killed his best friend. Keep in mind all the men in the film fetishized her innocence. 

He killed the guy in the end because at that point justice hadn't been served.  The main guy was holed up in the store.  His own people were defending the white guy in front of cops. The murderer was going to get away! So yea he felt compelled to do something about it. To Chino that guy was no different than the other white nationalists he associated himself with. The same group that in the scene just before the ending pretty much tried to rape that other girl!

The reason is because they used to use “whelm”in situations like when a boat capsized. Then from that “overwhelmed” came to be an emphatic version and of course we have metaphorical uses in the sense of being “overwhelmed with emotion” because you’re so submerged that you can’t control or escape them. Underwhelmed came later to give an image of there not being enough to fully submerge you. Using whelmed to indicate an emotional balance is extremely strange because you’re like…comfortably drowning or buried?

Say content, or lackluster, or satisfied, or the multitude of other words that already exist and mean what you mean for middling impressions

Do you want to bring “gruntled” back? It was in use hundreds of years ago too. Let’s give it the definition of eat quickly, because it sounds funny.

My comment on the new version is that somehow Spielberg made it much more immediate and IMO less distanced than Bernstein's masterpiece.  I have seen the original assault scene probably 40 times and it NEVER hit me the way Spielberg's scene did.  There was something about the original that never let you quite forget it was a musical and everybody could break into song and dance at any moment.  But Spielberg went further, I think, and made it emotional and real.",rcyr5c

Even though none of them liked Anita, they knew she had to get out of there as soon as she could and they did their best to help her.

The rest of the Jets are clearly afraid of what he's going to do, .... etc. We needed to see that he made a choice to play the role of peacemaker -- a choice that isn't maybe natural to him.

There are tons and tons of talented people out there with incredible range.

Whereas for the male lead, they just tapped the dude from The Fault in our Stars. And why? Is West Side Story / Steven Spielberg not enough of a sell in its own right that they have to try and add some random ""star power""? Fuck no, they could have put out a search the same way they did for Maria and gotten a phenomenal person and made him a star, but... They just didn't.

I don't know why Hollywood does this. They did it when they threw Russell Crowe into Les Miserables and Gerard Butler into Phantom of the Opera.

Again, from your perspective, what happened between Tony and Maria in the span of a handful of hours that makes you believe they are so incredibly in love?
