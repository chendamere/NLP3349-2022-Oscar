Judge was an asshole as he supposed to be so props to Langella. Refreshing to see Gordon-Levitt again, even though he has little room to wiggle through. 

That aside, delving down the wiki-hole after watching it was one hell of a ride. The Fred Hampton assassination was fucking disgusting, although it looked tame compared to the COINTELPRO shit the FBI did.",jcmq8s

g92lcso,"Really enjoyed the movie. Did a great job of showing, as Hoffman said, the contempt the government had (and still has) for certain groups of people. Mayor’s office denying permits to the park, police armed to the teeth at a peaceful protest because of the lack of permits, the police hounding, cornering, and then starting the violence. Nixon’s White House and the DOJ making an example out of a group of people that the prior DOJ found to be innocent. A racist bigot senile judge who has already determined guilt before the trial began. It’s all so infuriating.",jcmq8s

g94j9a1,"I know some people aren't happy with the name reading at the end, but I honestly found it touching and teared up some. The protest where about stopping more deaths in a unwinnable war.  I like to think it was also done to really echo whats going on today: too many innocent lives were lost that didn't need to be lost- from covid, to police brutality, and protest. It's too easy to just recognize the amount of deaths and not see them as individuals wiith families.

The acting was honestly amazing. I honestly forgot this was a Sorkin feature.",jcmq8s
g92kzr2,"The court transcript is available online and this trial really was a travesty of justice. 

I think this movie did a serviceable job in toe-ing the line to portray an infuriating situation without coming off as ham-fisted (i.e. making the prosecution cartoonish-ly evil and the defence cartoonishly good). In my opinion, the events speak for themselves without needing to take artistic license with the characters of anyone involved. 

However, these moments in particular felt contrived.

1) The final scene of Hayden reading the list of dead Vietnam soldiers did not happen as far as I'm aware, and the change from what really happened seemed unnecessary. The actual closing statement made by Kunstler is really powerful, and I'll quote it at the end. 

2) The moment where Hoffman talks about pronouns and how he has actually read all of Hayden's publications was sort of a ""wink at the camera"" moment. 

3) Ramsey Clark's portrayal was a caricature. Making him a casual give-no-fucks badass was satisfying to watch as a viewer, but definitely was playing to the audience's sympathies. 

4) One of the most confusing additions is David Dellinger punching the deputy, which did not happen in real life. Dellinger was a radical pacifist and this addition is offensive. 

5) Showing Fred Hampton being murdered during the time of the trial - when he was murdered over a month later. 


-----------------------------------------


General thoughts:

I enjoyed the decision to humanize JGL by showing his internal struggle between his ethics and duty to the law- though I'm not sure as to the veracity of this.

Incredible performances by Judge Hoffman, Seale, Kunstler, Dellinger, Hayden, and Strong in particular. Eddie Redmayne pulled off a great accent, while surprisingly I felt that Sacha Baron Cohen's accent was a little sloppy at times. 

Sorkin is a master of dialogue, and could have done without some of the snarky whispers that are really directed at the audience. 	Most of Lee Weiner's dialogue consisted of these quips.

-----------------------------

All-in-all, the events that happened are really so absurd that it must have been hard to convey their realism. Things like Hoffman/Rubin wearing the robes, the treatment of Seale, gross bias from the judge, etc. 

The verdict of the trial in reality was not a feel-good moment, and I'm still confused as to why it was portrayed as such. Along with the sentences, the judge ordered the long hair of the defendants AND defense attorneys to be forcibly cut due to being deemed offensive. The real life events left many people angry, and I believe this movie should have left the viewer feeling angry as well - if true to history. 

-----------------------------

Parts of the closing statement from the (real life) trial:

>  ""When a new truth comes upon the earth, or a great idea necessary for mankind is born, where does it come from?  Not from the police force, or the prosecuting attorneys, or the judges, or the lawyers, or the doctors.  Not there.  It comes from the despised and the outcasts, and it comes perhaps from jails and prisons.  It comes from men who have dared to be rebels and think their thoughts, and their faith has been the faith of rebels.
    ""What do you suppose would have happened to the working men except for these rebels all the way down through history?  Think of the complacent cowardly people who never raise their voices against the powers that be.  If there had been only these, you gentlemen of the jury would be hewers of wood and drawers of water.  You gentlemen would have been slaves.  You gentlemen owe whatever you have and whatever you hope to these brave rebels who dared to think, and dared to speak, and dared to act.""


> An intolerable war abroad has divided and dismayed us all.  Racism at home and poverty at home are both causes of despair and discouragement.  In a so-called affluent society, we have people starving, and people who can't even begin to approximate the decent life.
    These are rough problems, terrible problems, and as has been said bv everybody in this country, they are so enormous that they stagger the imagination.  But they don't go away by destroying their critics.  They don't vanish by sending men to jail.  They never did and they never will.
    To use these problems by attempting to destroy those who protest against them is probably the most indecent thing that we can do.  You can crucify a Jesus, you can poison a Socrates, you can hand John Brown or Nathan Hale, you can kill a Che Guevara, you can jail a Eugene Debs or a Bobby Seale.  You can assassinate John Kennedy or a Martin Luther King, but the problems remain.  The solutions are essentially made by continuing and perpetuating with every breath you have the right of men to think, the right of men to speak boldly and unafraid, the right to be masters of their souls, the right to live free and to die free.  The hangman's rope never solved a single problem except that of one man.",jcmq8s
g930qkz,"I've never had the beginning of a movie hype me up more than this one. The introduction of Abbie Hoffman, Bobby Seale, Tom Hayden, David Dellinger, and Jerry Rubin finishing each other's sentences, mixed with the archival footage of the mounting tensions over Vietnam and the draft was spectacular. Like we were immediately rolling into the sixties.",jcmq8s
g9vq8cc,"Honestly, I feel like this movie is perfect in its timing. The widespread protests, police violence, judicial appointments, political trials, the chaos behind the concept of “law and order”, etc. 

Being someone who lives in Portland and has attended numerous protests here (only to have the narrative be reconstructed in a misleading way 99% of the time) it felt somewhat justified to have a similar story told on screen.

I also loved the way they portrayed the differences between Bobby Seale and the rest of the group: Bobby was **not** treated like a human being with equal protections under the law during this trial. The scene where they gagged him actually made me feel sick. Obviously he’s not a huge part of the conclusion of the story, but I’m very happy that they gave us plenty of time to absorb what he went through and how he was treated in the initial phases rather than having them treat him like some sort of tangent. 

Then the differences between Hayden and Hoffman was great. I loved their dialogue and I feel like it tells a story about what’s currently happening with the left side of the US political spectrum. I’m someone who relates to Hayden a bit more than I relate to Hoffman, but when Hayden stands for the judge, I actually wanted to scream at him. I also loved when Hoffman gave his testimony and blew everyone out of the water. 

And that judge....I think the last “character” I hated more was Joffrey Baratheon (and Joff was fictional!). 

Overall, I can see why this movie might not be super satisfying for normal people who aren’t revolving their entire lives around the current political situation were in, but for myself, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",jcmq8s

g9472iq,"Such a good film.

Frank Langella, SBC, Mark Rylance and Eddie Redmayne deserve to be up for awards consideration.

Really liked how Sorkin spliced real riot footage in between filmed riot footage. Made you fee like you were actually there.

The shots at Trump were kinda noticeable as well ""The President is not the client of the Attorney General.""

Definitely something to watch in history class to educate our kids.",jcmq8s
g9pgw8f,I loved the 'do you think there were only 7 people protesting and the rest were all FBI informants?' line. I've often wondered that myself pertaining to certain groups.,jcmq8s
g92cy7p,"Incredible, IMO. 

The acting ranged from passable to great. No bad performances. Frank langella was excellently frustrating as the judge. Cohen and Redmayne were really evocative of their respective counterparts, even if they weren't spot on impressions.

The writing was excellent, Sorkin-y but not outlandish. Witty but not to the point of not being believable. Often Sorkin's characters dont seem real becuase of how quick witted they all are. I felt he pulled back enough here though.
I believe I remember that egg joke from an episode of the westwing from Margaret to Leo, too.

Directing was pretty good too. The story moved along well. And the framing of the story around the trial was very well done.

For cons.. I do find it dipped in intensity a little bit once Bobby Seales mistrial was called, that really felt like a bigger ""win"" than the ending. And the ending wasnt great, but to be fair the ending in real life wasnt great either. I honestly cant think of a way for the real life ending to be portrayed optimistically, maybe it shouldnt have been. But I respect Sorkin for trying, there are enough pessimists.

g92celu,"Loved this. Gripping story, legitimately funny, and genuinely moving. This movie felt like Sorkin really finding a way to blend so much of what makes his work so special-- snappy dialogue, quippy humor, courtroom drama, and serious, heavy-handed political themes. 

I went in with high expectations and Sorkin really exceeded them. As an aside-- at the end of the movie, when they gave us the coda about how the defendants lives progressed, I realized just how old-fashioned  this type of movie has become. Shout out to Netflix and Paramount for having the hudspa to put out a movie like this.",jcmq8s

g9322qf,"Mark Rylance fucking killed it. Going into this film, with all the talent involved, he was kind of the last person I was looking at out of that cast.

You know you’re a great actor when you end up more noticeable than Sacha Baron Cohen as Abbie Hoffman with a giant afro. Bravo, Mark Rylance. You always surprise me.",jcmq8s
g99c1ey,"It has definitely been a hot minute since a film had me 100% hooked, this was a masterpiece.",jcmq8s
g94n93n,"The most Sorkin thing I’ve ever seen and probably will ever see is how he made vague, haphazard grammar the literal direct cause of the riot, the major dramatic reveal of the movie, and due to causing the riot, the reason for the movie to exist in the first place.

Sorkin has gone mad with power.",jcmq8s
g9faa1x,"Honestly the more I’ve read into the trial the more it’s obvious Sorkin decided to forfeit real history with the sanitized, liberalized version of it. 

Hayden wasn’t a buttoned up, quiet bookish type. He regularly made harsh calls to arms and was described as a militant anti-war advocate. He embraced the antics of the defendants and even sported a bucket hat and fake goatee, and went to sleep on the table during the trial. 

Dellinger was by far the oldest but not a shrinking violet. HE read the names (of American AND  Viet-Cong soldiers) portrayed at the end of the movie, during which Hoffman and Hayden laid out an American AND Viet-Cong flag. The bailiffs then fought Hoffman for the Vietnamese flag but left the American one, pushing Hoffman to announce the court is okay with the defendants disrespecting America but not Vietnam. Dellinger also called Schultz and the judge racists and Nazis and was cited for contempt for that. 

Bobby Seale was tied up for 3 consecutive days before he was released and allowed a new trial. The bailiffs also punched him in the testicles during the trial at one point when his bonds slipped. 

Jerry Rubin was certainly a stoner and played the dumb hippie well. But also could be very articulate and was actually fairly intelligent, becoming a hugely successful businessman in the 80s. He also didn’t fall for the “honey pot.” The informant tied to him was an undercover male cop that largely tailed him and definitely didn’t use the same line on him as Margaret did in “The West Wing.”

The trial as a whole was a clown show at best. All the defendants AND the lawyers worked together to make a mockery of the judge because they knew it was a biased. 

I get artistic license and I understand making a good movie but this was pretty egregious.

Jeremy Strong Sach Baron Cohen and Mark Rylance were the standouts (either Rylance or SBC or both should get a nom). Redmayne was very good. Nobody disappointed.  Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Bobby Seale was a scene stealer, particularly in one scene (you know the one).

I particularly liked the contrast between Cohen and Redmayne's characters, and how they represented change in different ways.

The editing and the cinematography was also really great. It can make a scene carry weight.

The movie also seemed very relevant to today's society, and I'm sure that's no coincidence.

My only problem with it was the ending with everyone standing up and the inspirational music while the Judge suddenly is helpless to stop it. Felt very ""Robert Zumeckis"". But that's a neatpick.

Jeremy Strong was pretty hilarious throughout. I loved Michael Keaton’s brief appearance as well. 

Great use of editing in this movie during the trial scenes loved the way it cut between flashbacks and people on the stand, different characters finishing sentences. 

The portrayal of the rivalry between Hoffman and Hayden was a great narrative thread that was pretty relevant to today. They both had good points and it was nice to see them sort of embracing each other in the final moments. Hoffman becomes more composed on the stand and Hayden creates a flashy display on the trials final day.

I did, however, find the inclusion of Bobby Seale a bit odd. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II was amazing in the role, but I'm not sure what importance his character played in the narrative as a whole to propel the story forward.

Lawyer: So how do you overthrow or dismember the government peacefully?

Abbie:In this country we do it every four years.

To me that was hilarious because it shows that them protesting caused more of a revolution than the voting system.

Knowing Sorkin's politics going into the film, I knew the essential points that were going be made. I was NOT however, expecting an internal dialogue about frictions and in-fighting on the left (VERY relevant nowadays). What’s more important; playing the part until you can ascend the hierarchy enough to dismantle the system, or seeing the bigger picture and shaping hearts and minds to change the psychological landscape? The film did a great job of highlighting these different ideologies accurately, as well as making it clear that whilst one attitude is more sensible and agreeable, the other is a lot sexier and more immediately appealing. Ultimately though, these two voices have to come to an understanding and unite in the face of their common enemy (taking the form of the ‘thug’ judge). It takes a healthy mix of both idealistic and pragmatic thinking to make change.

This struck me as the most interesting and poignant theme in this film, and perhaps Sorkin’s main angle since he knew people on the right probably weren’t going to give the film a chance:
That everyone on the left needs to put aside their moral-elitism or smug-centrism and come together as a united front. Because people on the right have a fuck of a lot less in-fighting.

Yours Sincerely,

A smug centrist.",jcmq8s
gevyi8g,"I'm confused by the comments. I just watched the film and I loved it because of the storytelling style and the way it played with music and editing and the acting, but I don't know much about the director and I don't know much about cinema either, although I love it with passion. So, is this a good movie or not? Is it a good adaptation of history or not?

gdjcy5d,"There were parts that were done phenomenally and fewer moments that stood out to me as kinda poorly done in comparison especially the ending which left a really sour taste in my mouth. For a movie so angry and sparky the ending felt completely out of touch with the rest of the film.

The movie has an excellent sense of pacing however, and from the first scene you are immediately drawn into the plot. I was not expecting Mark Rylance to show up and put on the best performance of the movie. His frustration was palpable. 

Some of the decisions to change facts im history however were pretty gross and unforgivable. I recognize sometimes movies should alter facts to tell an entertaining movie, but those changes should be made only if it serves to benefit the movie, which the historical deviations featured in the film didn't always do.

Still, well worth a watch and the film had moments that were some of my favorite in a movie for 2020.

7.5/10

Would have had a 9 if the film was more reflective of history and ended on a less jubilant, more bittersweet and somber note.",jcmq8s
g97wsz0,"Having thought on this a bit, I thought overall it was an excellent film. As I wrote elsewhere in the thread there was obviously a lot of back and forth that could not have made it in due to time. The two issues I had are quite simple:

&#x200B;

Dellinger should **not** have punched anyone. It would be like having a film of version MLK Jr or Gandhi punch someone - it simply was inaccurate and needless.

Secondly, I wish there was more of the defence witnesses shown. Defence witnesses were *incredible*: Alan Ginsburg, Judy Collins, Timothy Leary, Arlo Guthrie, etc. It was the who's who of the liberal left movement on the stand. Hell, Judy Collins *sang* [Where Have All the Flowers Gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxsNKD6el5s) *into the record.*",jcmq8s

gfnef2x,"As much as I really really enjoyed this movie, I can’t help but feel that if I were to read up on the actual historical events that the movie probably dramatized a decent chunk of this. 

I know The Imitation Game isn’t really well-liked on Reddit, but I felt the same way about this as I did with that; super entertaining but it felt as though so much of it was historically inaccurate.

EDIT: to elaborate more, I know that Sorkin took liberties with The Social Network and Steve Jobs and that movies don’t NEED to be historically accurate but it’s just that it felt like the edges were sanded off and that the finished product felt a bit sanitized.",jcmq8s
gh6k928,"I don’t get the problem with the movie being a bit inaccurate or dramatized because with 6 months being chunked into a film, it is bound to happen. I don’t rate the movie on accuracy but as a film. That said, this isn’t a perfect film however it is stylized in a way that accentuates Sorkin’s dialogue. And I think that is a great aspect of the film considering it does revolve arguments, wording, and wit. Pretty good film overall, and the problem I see people have with it are the inaccuracies and the ending. Subjective as everything is but nothing is ever accurate to a T and being any more accurate wouldn’t translate too well on film.",jcmq8s
g9j0a1y,"I don't see enough people talking about the score! The two primary sequences of police brutality (Jerry and Rennie on the Hill and Tom's Tape) are both underscored with some absolutely electrifying pieces of music. 


Pemberton has made some very diverse scores over the years, but the way the score begins in universe with the drums from the protest, only to have them continue and build when the scene ends in stellar. You can literally hear the moment that the protest has gotten away from our main characters' control as the score becomes too fast for the chanting, too chaotic and frenetic in the moments before 'Take the hill!'.


Truly an outstanding couple of songs there.

g9c8y1n,"I’m conflicted about this movie.

On the one hand, I really dislike how Sorkin portrays leftist politics. The tension between pragmatism and idealism is a gross oversimplification of the arguments on the left. When Abbie says that we have a revolution “every four years” I think I visibly winced. That felt, to me, at least, like Sorkin making leftists out to be liberals. The fact that many of these people were socialists seems to be unspoken on purpose, but at least the Black Panthers are depicted somewhat fairly. I think Sorkin’s liberal centrism shines through here even more than it does in The West Wing, where he’s replaced the actual closing statement with a feel-good ending. The ending was not feel-good in real life, and I think putting a liberal “good guys always win by taking the moral high ground” spin on what is really a tough leftist struggle, a disservice is done to all people involved. Same with having Dellinger, a radical pacifist, punch the cops in the courtroom.

On the other hand, hoooooly shit is this some good-ass Sorkin. I’m a fanboy and idgaf. Superb writing, direction, performances. Spectacular movie.

In short, I’m a radical leftist who gives Sorkin a pass because holy fucking shit is he good lmao",jcmq8s

g98n04w,"The script kind of felt all over the place at times, but overall was a pretty good film depicting how the government acted against protestors. Funny coincidence that it came out this year. I figured the scene where Bobby Seale is bound in court was dramatized for effect, but sounds like the reality was even worse than what Sorkin put in the film. So after reading the real history of the case, I think Sorkin did a very good job of showing how nuts this trial was while making sure it, for the most part, did not seem as literally unbelievable as the reality was.

Edit: It sounds like he didn't do as great a job with the characters themselves, which seems kind of strange. I feel like if he needed more drama there was more than enough real-life shit to draw on. But ah well. Abdul-Mateen deserves a ton of praise for his acting in this film and I'm glad to see him getting a lot of substantial roles lately.",jcmq8s

g99e0ym,"This movie was fine. I enjoy Sorkin as a writer just like most everyone, but this didn’t really have the sharp precision like Social Network or Steve Jobs. He’s good at emotional swells but he leaned on that a little too much for me and it made for some sentimental moments that I didn’t really connect with. I’ve seen this and Molly’s game and I have to say I’m not really a fan of his touch as a director. I’m not a filmmaker so I won’t pretend to know specifics but there’s something about his music choice and the way he shoots things that seems kind of bland. Die hard Sorkin heads will worship this movie and rightfully so, but I think a different directors approach would’ve taken a story like this to the heights it could reach.",jcmq8s
g9d1z9i,"The film was entertaining.

HOWEVER the film pretty inaccurate. Idk much about the actual trial to be honest but I do know a lot about the Black Panthers and Fred Hampton's murder does not match the time line at all. Sorkin just threw that in there. Also Bobby Seale was bound and gagged for THREE DAYS straight not 10 minutes like the film made it seem.

The ""cop murder"" the movie mentions Seale was arrested for was actually a Black Panther member/suspected FBI informant.

I also think they tried too hard to make the prosecution look sympathetic to the 7. 

It was a good film though.",jcmq8s
g92m45u,"Maybe I've been a little more starved for good new movies than normal, but I fucking adored this movie. Those who don't like Sorkin, this will likely not convert you to his writing, but his directing is a step up from his first effort, and the editing alongside the other tech elements are especially sharp and easily watchable.

The main draw here is the acting and the dialogue (who doesn't love to watch witty people argue, honestly?). While a lot of people have shouted the praises of the cast, Mark Rylance was the standout for me, just being so damn watchable and easy to root for. He stands a good chance at an Oscar nod. However, he'll be duking it out with Yahya Abdul Mateen who embodies everything frustrating about this trial and how it treated Bobby Seale in so many damn good ways, and Sacha Baron Cohen who starts out a bit one note, but really makes Abbie Hoffman truly interesting, deep, and compelling. While he probably won't get awards love, Frank Langella is also so fucking good at portraying how incompetent and scary Judge Hoffman was.

I'd also like to give a shoutout to the rest of the cast who probs won't get nominations; not a single one is giving a bad performance. Michael Keaton is stealing the show in two very noteworthy scenes. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is showing up to remind us how much we've missed him recently and brings a little bit more to what could be a one-note character. JOHN FUCKING CAROLL LYNCH, the Zodiac Killer himself, is there being amazing and I really wanted to say his name, alongside Jeremy Strong who had me laughing way too damn much. Finally, I've had issues with him previously, and was originally worried about him in the first third, but Eddie Redmayne playing someone so different from his usual wheelhouse was a sight to see, especially his performance in the last third.

Watch this movie, and if you're voting a certain way coming up, really look for the similarities. While some of this movie was made with those modern similarities in mind, the events of this summer could not have been predicted to be so close to what unfolds in parts of this movie. Watch it, and really think about who you're voting for.",jcmq8s

Sorkin's really refining his craft, especially as a director. He's always been a good writer but from a directing standpoint this is a huge step up from Molly's Game.",jcmq8s
g9p9opv,Keaton scene was my favorite. Dick on table fuck you pay me style,jcmq8s
g9qkvny,"This is pretty conclusive evidence that Sorkin shouldn't be directing. The difference between David Fincher or Danny Boyle is stark. It was really clear that he could have used an expert hand, especially to help him resolve some of the more glaring problems (fade to black during the Hoffman testimony, abrupt and corny ending). Honestly I think he benefits from having to share decision-making power.

Overall this was pretty good, and a great performance from SBC. I don't mind editorial choices made to tell a good story (like Steve Jobs) but a lot of the choices made here force Sorkin's own weak politics into the story where they don't belong. 

It was heartbreaking the way Rubin was portrayed as a burnout and the Panthers were represented as libs (though Abdul-Mateen was great) who thought the idea of Seale saying ""fry the pigs"" was out of line. Also the fictional well-meaning undercover FBI agent who was only trying to help the protests continue peacefully, or how Richard Schultz was *reluctantly* going along with the prosecution but was secretly a ""good guy.""

Abbie Hoffman was portrayed mostly pretty well, but it was pretty frustrating to hear him on the stand say that he thought the US had great institutions and the only problem is the wrong people in charge. Like he was an anarcho-communist, he didn't just want a more polite democrat president he really wanted to change the country fundamentally. But since that perspective isn't something Sorkin's brain can really handle because he has bad politics Hoffman has to be made into a dissenting liberal. 

All these changes reinforce Sorkin's politics, which are basically that the status quo is fine, the FBI is good actually, there may be some bad eggs in the justice system from time too time but thank God that Our Great American Institutions will correct their errors, the Vietnam war was a crime *because of the draft* not because it killed millions in South East Asia.

Through these choices the actual voices of the defendants are ironed over, flattened into mild critique. That's a bummer, you know?

Edit: [Chapo released a podcast today with the guys from The West Wing Thing]( https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackWolfFeed/comments/jgoy0i/465_sorkinverse_rise_of_the_7_feat_dave_anthony/) on the film that expresses a similar opinion to mine, but with a much more detailed understanding of the individuals and historical events.

g9ahngh,"Very topical and very effective. I found myself truly emotionally invested despite recognizing some clichés and some heavyhanded moments. For instance, at the end when >!Eddie Redmayne started reading the list of dead Vietnam soldiers, and the music swelled, and the whole courtroom stood up and clapped!< I was rolling my eyes but also simultaneously had tears welling up in that very same pair of eyes. I will say, however, those moments were very few and far between and I did genuinely like this movie a lot. I love it when comedic actors go dramatic, so Sacha Baron Cohen was a standout for me, but I feel like Frank Langella is going really unappreciated as the Judge. He did a fantastic job of being such a believable, unlikable, unqualified asshole. He really disappeared into the part, he's a great actor. 

Another - not so much a critique, I guess more of a comment - I had was it wasn't as ""zing-y"" as Sorkin's previous scripts. For me, that was a bit of a letdown because I love zing-y Sorkin (Steve Jobs is a personal favorite). But I also know a lot of people criticize him for that same zing-y-ness, so this could be seen as a positive for this film.

I also found the argument between Hayden and Abbie Hoffman to be a pretty powerful illustration of the differences within the progressive movement that still exist today. I think my biggest criticism would be that ended on a note that was a smidge too feel-good in my opinion, even by Sorkin standards-- but I think it was at least a nice antidote to how goddamn infuriating I found the judge to be.

Great acting all around, the dialogue is exactly what you expect- quippy, funny, not at all how real humans talk but its entertaining as shit.

g94ha4j,"*The Trial of the Chicago 7* manages to overcome the tv-movie hokiness most biopics-of-the-now fall into (a ""biopic-of-the-now"" is a movie about a historical event that's really about today's politics). I was worried in the first several minutes because of Sorkin's soundtrack choice, which is less fitting in a film about police brutality, the criminal justice system, and free speech than it is in *Hairspray*, but Sorkin, as he usually does when he's on his A-game, is charming enough to overcome that, using quick edits to emphasize just how cut-together these disparate organizers are.

Kyle Smith panned this movie by writing Sorkin's highest aim is to ""write quips."" I disagree with him, and it's largely because of the movie's final image. People here are pointing out the trial never ended with Hayden reading a list of the fallen, that it would have been more powerful for Sorkin to use Kunstler's closing statements. I disagree. Martin Luther King, Jr. was never as disagreeable with LBJ as *Selma* depicted him to be, yet that movie is praised by almost everyone on this subreddit, even for all its tv-movie hokiness (the action in Bloody Sunday sequence is horrifying, but it's undermined by the after-school special narration from the *Times* reporter covering the events).

I will gladly accept Sorkin's artistic license so long as he can compose a final image that is like a Trumbull painting in scope and meaning. It is perhaps his most realized statement of what America can be—even when it fails—than his entire run on *The West Wing.* If a picture's worth a thousand words, how many words am I saying this last image has? The black and white men and women standing as Hayden reads the names of the fallen, as Judge Hoffman bangs his gavel for order with as much fury as he can, is an America that takes a stand for justice when its institutions fail them while respecting and upholding its ideals all the same. A beautiful and stirring statement for a vivid and by turns horrifying movie.",jcmq8s

g94z5ii,"I really enjoyed this, its pretty easily my favorite movie of the year to this point. I'm a big Sorkin fan, and this cast is stacked with actors I like, so it was always a good bet that I would like this one, and I think its a step up from Molly's Game (which I also really liked). For the record, I was pretty unaware of this story (I'm American, but our schools do a pretty bad job of teaching recent American History) and didn't really know anything going in.

What I liked: I can't talk about a Sorkin movie without mentioning his writing. I especially loved the opening scene as it cut between the different groups. The performances are pretty much great across the board, with only one that I didn't like. Frank Langella would be my MVP, he was so hate-able and from what I understand the character was actually turned down. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Mark Rylance were also standouts. In particular I've never really seen SBC in a serious role, and now I really wish we'd gotten his Freddy Mercury movie. I really liked the way the movie was structured, with the flashbacks and real footage integrated into the movie.

What I didn't like: I didn't much buy Jeremy Strong's performance. I don't know much about Jerry Rubin, so maybe that's just how he actually comes across, but in this film it felt more like an actor in a costume than a real person. I wish a few of the actors had gotten more to do, especially John Carroll Lynch and JGL. And while I admit it got me pretty emotional at the time, I think the ending being a work of fiction takes something away from its power.

I think it would've made a great series at Netflix. I wanted to see more of them.

One thing I didn't understand, why Sorkin made the prosecutor so sympathetic to the audience?",jcmq8s
g95igv6,"Sorkin continues his style and presents to us a wonderful movie. The direction and camera movement reminded me of David Fincher's style. I believe that Aaron Sorkin has picked up a few tricks from David Fincher, and I am looking forward to what he does next. The movie just like The Social Network is wonderfully woven across different time frames to present a coherent understanding of the events.  

Fun Fact: Steven Spielberg asked Aaron Sorkin to write a movie about the Chicago 7 many many years ago, but he never got around to it. It was during these times, with Trump and all, that he felt that this movie was needed. 

Overall this is a 10/10 for me. I think Sorkin hit a home run. The music score, direction, acting of the movie is on point.",jcmq8s

Jesus at the pronoun bit. Loved that. Also loved Hayden's speech. I imagine its seen as a bit sappy and Sorkin to the max and I know aspects of the story have been exaggerated(but also not exaggerated enough  too) but I did like it and the ending.
Daniel Pemberton's score was superb too

g96vq6c,"Maybe because I’ve known about this case fully for so long in my life but the way Sorkin tried to “Social Network” this story was just...I’ll say it...lazy. He tried to Sorkin-y this as much as possible and imo it just didn’t work. Look, I understand every biographical film does need a little bit of fluff for the drama but 80% of the film is fabricated behind typical bullshit Hollywood film exaggerations. The script is all over the place going back and fourth between the trial and flashbacks of the riots attempting to evoke emotion of a lot of stuff that was either muddled or didn’t even happen at all. I honestly think it would have been just fine doing a realistic linear storyline going from the riots to the trial and it would have tugged on the heartstring even more. For instance, BOBBY SEALE WAS TIED UP AND GAGGED FOR SEVERAL DAYS, NOT 5 MINUTES.

As much problems I have with the screenplay and style of the film, the bright spot was this amazing ensemble cast. Not one weak link at all. Even Jeremy Strong playing as a stoner yippie was hilariously great. Redmayne and Sacha was stellar but the anchor was Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Bobby Seale. He was spectacular and stole every scene (I may be bias because he is becoming one of my favorite up and coming actors). Great performances all around though.

With all that being said, I don’t “hate” it. This film had a lot of potential and maybe if Sorkin didn’t direct this one or had someone co-write with him, it could have been amazing for me. I guess I kinda see this as “this is what happens when you let Aaron Sorkin have too much control for a movie.”",jcmq8s
g95irp9,"I came into this a HUGE fan of Molly's Game and not knowing much else of Sorkin's work besides The Social Network. I had many minor gripes with the film, but ultimately walked away enjoying it.

Gripes:  
\- Not familiar enough with these events and found the opening 15m or so just a little bit too fast-paced and difficult to grasp  
\- The ending... ugh. A bit too much cheese for me.  
\- Weird fade-out transition between end of Sacha Baron Cohen's scene to the final scene, it felt cut short to me.  
\- A lot of commenters are praising the lack of ""Sorkin-isms"", but honestly I would have liked some more. I came into this expecting tons of punchy dialogue and one-liners dammit!

But despite all those gripes, I do agree with the general consent that it was a deeply engaging and surprisingly relevant movie overall, though if I'm being honest I was expecting a little more. 7/10",jcmq8s

JGL was underused. As was Keaton.

Pacing was a touch off. I dunno a solid 3/10. Anyone else feel this way?",jcmq8s
g93i87k,"Pretty solid courtroom drama. I didn't think Sorkin's political sensibilities really work well here (since it's a movie focused on a group of leftists and this movie's own centrist politics conflicts with that) and he makes quite a bit of changes from real life to fit his ideologies but I stopped noticing that much because the way the story is presented works so well. Sorkin's fast-paced dialogue is perfect for a courtrooom drama and gives it this sense of urgency that had me entertained the whole way through. Also helps that every single actor gave extremely compelling performances (my favourite was Mark Rylance). The editing was much more inspired than I expected at points too.
 

There's some really weird bits of narration, like Sacha Baron Cohen's character doing exposition dumps in his stand-up show in the middle of a different scene with no context, and it's incredibly bland to look at (surprised that there was a time that this wasn't a Netflix film because it looks exactly like a Netflix film). Really wish Spielberg still directed this.",jcmq8s
g9kcky0,"Agreed. In addition to all the things you pointed out, his dialog is theater-ish, with characters doing too much explaining to the audience in melodramatic fashion, rather than realistic dialog that you might believe. The actors do the best they can with it, though. I can't watch much of Sorkin for this reason. For good dialog and characters in a film like this, I go to Oliver Stone. Now he has his own agenda and pushes facts around to suit his beliefs, too, but I give him a pass because his direction, writing, characters and dialog are much more convincing, and Vince Gilligan's writing and dialog is always convincing and is never expository like Sorkin's.",jcmq8s

“Ya that was shitty what happened but everything turned out alright.”

Textbook example of what to avoid with these historical dramas. Thinking of how Just Mercy ends by showing us that the dude is *still* saving people from the cruelty of the death penalty. Or Blackkklansman using footage from Charlotte to not let you think the KKK is a relic of the past. 

Sorkin spends like 90% of the movie showing how an American courtroom, somewhere that is supposed to be the pinnacle of balanced justice, is just the opposite. And then doesn’t follow through with it. I still liked it, but was bummed they wasted all that great momentum on such a sanctimonious ending.",jcmq8s

They both also made me want to call my dad, a civil rights attorney, and tell him that I see his life in a new light and understand more fully now why he chose the career path that he did.  He took an entire class on 1968 in college (in the mid-70s) and I always thought the idea of taking such a niche class on something so recent that you were alive for was kind of ridiculous, but thinking about it now I'm like, how could you *not* spend an entire semester on just 1968?",jcmq8s
g930mzq,I think of everyone in the cast (they all killed it) they should give a best supporting actor nomination to Mark Rylance.

g92zomx,"I was really looking forward to this film but it fell pretty flat for me. It seemed like the film wanted to convey the appearance of a hard-hitting, biting piece while actually being very whitewashed and sanitized. It just felt artificially optimistic in order to be a ""feel-good movie"".

I also was not a fan of the very specific agenda that the film was pushing, given today's political context. Redmayne's character is the well-dressed, professional, eloquent, ""reasonable"", and ""pragmatic"" one while Sacha Baron Cohen's character is a hippie who is high all the time and does stand-up. In the end, it's Redmayne's character's approach that wins out. This is very clearly a comment on liberal politics today, and the differing opinions about how best to bring about change therein. Don't even get me started on Jeremy Strong's character. I thought the coda was also super egregious. Ah yes, the serious moderate liberal becomes a politician and gets reelected six times, while the juvenile, idealistic progressives write a book called ""Steal This Book"" and then kill themselves, or get run over by a car while jaywalking. Also, look, the prosecutor is sympathetic and is having misgivings. There's good people on both sides!

I'm not sure how much of it was needed to tell a more cohesive story or Sorkin just being Sorkin.

The only names I could ever remember from the Chicago 7 were Hoffman and Rubin. Mostly due to me reading Steal This Book nearly 20 years ago. Also, if you want more Abbie Hoffman check out Steal This Movie. It stars Vincent D'Onofrio as Hoffman and he's pretty good in it. I  can't quite recall its accuracy though since its also been nearly 20 years since I've seen it. I do remember really liking it as a teen though.

g9nkcxa,"I thought there were great performances from Jeremy Strong and Mark Rylance. The others were good too although I thought Dellinger was interesting and could have been explored more.  
  
As for the writing and direction, typical Sorkin. All the people who have to look good come out looking good. The shot at the end where they show the female police officer who honey trapped Jerry Rubin smiling as Tom Hayden reads out the names of the fallen soldiers was just unnecessary. It really irritated me that he felt that the film couldn't end with the beautiful blonde lady being anything less than a sympathetic character. She walked them into an ambush and later avoided answering questions honestly (by the film's own account). But she smiled at the end. What a swell gal!  
  
And can someone tell me whether the ""our"" blood thing has any truth to it? Because if Sorkin made that up, it is the most bullshit 60 secs of writing I have ever witnessed. What even was that?! Just a bullshit twist that suddenly makes this flawed character the most virtuous hero ever and we should be ashamed we thought even for a second that he was anything less. He saw his friend's skull cracked open. It's not outside the realm of possibility that he wanted some cops to get hurt. It was an outburst against a brutal act by the police. Leave it at that. Don't get why it has to be justified. This seems to be a habit for Sorkin. He likes putting the protagonists on the back foot and then suddenly flip it around.

Those who knock down their score a bit for the “too positive” ending scene ... 

I was completely fine with the ending; I loved it cheesy music and all!!! It was cathartic and we deserve it after the year we’ve had in the US. 

It felt like a trial for 2020 protestors, mirrors of the past of the cops beating hippies in the park, the teargas, same tools to beat us down to stay in line today  .... We have Breonna Taylor, a moment that mirrored the past with the Fred Hampton execution by law enforcement and death announcement in the movie... and the end mirrored the senseless deaths of today, it felt like someone reading the names of Covid deaths in front of the crooked Judge ... the judge being forced to listen to every name ... it felt like that judge is our Trump. 

Loved it.  I Cried.

g94pd5z,"Aaron Fuckin' Sorkin.

I think this guy oscillates between someone who, when in the right hands, writes the most thrilling scenes a screenwriter could write, and then at other times, someone who is so desperate to make his point, he bursts through the fourth wall to make it seem instead of watching The Newsroom, you're watching an Aaron Sorkin Ted talk.

I was sure this would be the latter, with no Reiner, Miller or Fincher, and Sorkin left to his own devices, i was sure we were going to get something that felt like it was Sorkin bashing me over the head with his own philosophies, whilst building strawmen who form the opposing view, strawmen that stumble over any sentence or argument.

But, actually, i think this was great. 

I actually thought Sorkin left the audience, mostly the left, with a really interesting argument about whether they should be Hayden's or Hoffman's when it comes to 'revolution' - and unlike Sorkin sometimes had the tendency to do, he didn't bash you over the head with a long-winded all-walking, all-talking monlogue that was clearly his view, he left it open-ended. 

It was VERY hollywood, it had HUGE dad film energy, but lots of great films fit these criteria. Sure, it chose to accentuate or make light of moments that i'm sure were much more harrowing, or multi-faceted for the real characters, Hoffman and Rubin specifcially, and i would have like to have seen Bobby Seale's arc have a slightly more fleshed out ending. But, it was thrilling, and it was gripping, and i could already wheel it back and start it again.

Rylance, Abdul-Mateen & Redmayne were fantastic. Cohen grew into the role as the film went on, but ultimately, it did become apparent that he was unfortunately a novice surrounded by world-class actors.",jcmq8s

&#x200B;

1) The movie has the characters talking a lot about how trial is getting in the way of the point of their protests, and debating whether to use the trial itself as a platform to amplify their message. This felt like a meta observation of the movie itself. The movie was fine, but it felt to me like the courtroom setting and the way the story was told really put the message of the film on the back burner. I left the film thinking “I guess I know what Sorkin was trying to convey here, but that’s just because I know the subject matter, not because the movie hammered it home very well.”

&#x200B;

2) The whole Michael Keaton scene drove me a little crazy. Of course he should not have been allowed to testify! His testimony wasn’t relevant or meaningful! It’s not evidence or news that different people in the government might have different opinions as to whether or not to bring an indictment - you don’t go around calling in to testify everyone to worked in the government to ask them if they agree with the idea of bringing charges. The fact that the new AG has a different view than the former AG is simply not relevant evidence of anything. And for the movie to play it up like the defense was being railroaded really got my goat, to be honest.",jcmq8s

>**MR. SCHULTZ:** Did you see where he went?  
**THE WITNESS:** He left with the head of the group that were carrying the flags.  
**MR. DELLINGER:** Oh, bullshit. That is an absolute lie.  
**THE COURT:** Did you get that, Miss Reporter?  
**MR. DELLINGER:** Let's argue about what you stand for and what I stand for, but let's not make up things like that.  
**THE COURT:** All of those remarks were made in the presence of the Court and jury by Mr. Dellinger.  
**MR. KUNSTLER:** Sometimes the human spirit can stand so much, and I think Mr. Dellinger reached the end of his.  
**THE COURT:** I have never heard in more than a half a century of the bar a man using profanity in this court or in a courtroom.  
**MR. HOFFMAN:** I've never been in an obscene Court, either.  
**THE COURT:** I never have as a spectator or as a judge. I never did.  
**MR. KUNSTLER:** You never sat here as a defendant and heard liars on the stand, your Honor.  
**MR. SCHULTZ:** Now, your Honor, I move that that statement--how dare Mr Kunstler--  
**MR. KUNSTLER:** I say it openly and fully, your Honor.  
**MR. SCHULTZ:** Your Honor, we had to sit with our lips tight, listening to those defendants, to those two defendants, Mr. Hayden and Mr. Hoffman, perjure themselves. I mean Davis and Hoffman.  
**MR. KUNSTLER:** A little Freudian slip, your Honor.  
**MR. SCHULTZ:** Your Honor, I have no further direct examination.  
**MR. DELLINGER:** You're a snake. We have to try to put you in jail for ten years for telling lies about us, Dick Schultz.  
**MARSHAL JONESON:** Be quiet, Mr. Dellinger.  
**MR. DELLINGER:** When it's all over, the judge will go to Florida, but if he has his way, we'll go to jail. That is what we're fighting for, not just for us, but for all the rest of the people in the country who are being oppressed.  
**VOICES:** Right on.  
**THE COURT:** Take that man into custody, Mr. Marshal. Take that man into custody.  
**VOICES:** Right on, right on.  
**MR. SCHULTZ:** Into custody?  
**THE COURT:** Into custody.

\[after the jury was discharged\]

>**THE COURT:** I have some observations to make here, gentlemen.Time and again, as the record reveals, the defendant Dave Dellinger has disrupted sessions of this court with the use of vile and insulting language. Today again he used vile and obscene language which, of course, is revealed by the record.I propose to try to end the use of such language if possible, and such conduct, by terminating the bail of this defendant.I do not, if I can help it, intend to permit such tactics to make a mockery out of this trial.I hereby, Mr. Clerk, terminate the bail of the defendant David Dellinger and remand him to the custody of the United States Marshal for the Northern District of Illinois for the remainder of this trial.

*(There is disorder in the courtroom.)*

>**MR. KUNSTLER:** You brought this on, your Honor. This is your fault. This is what happened in Chicago. You exerted the power, and I would like to argue the point.  
**THE COURT:** You won't argue the point.  
**MR. KUNSTLER:** I will argue, your Honor, that your Honor's action is completely and utterly vindictive, that there is no authority that says because a defendant blurts out a word in court--  
**THE COURT:** This isn't the first word, and I won't argue this.  
**MR. DAVIS:** This court is bullshit.  
**THE COURT:** There he is saying the same words again.  
**MR. DAVIS:** No, I say it.  
**MR. KUNSTLER:** That was not even David Dellinger who made the last remark.  
**MR. SCHULTZ:** It was Davis, the defendant Davis who just uttered the last--  
**MR. RUBIN:** Everything in this court is bullshit.  
**MR. DAVIS:** I associate myself with Dave Dellinger completely, 100 percent. This is the most obscene court I have ever seen.  
**MR. RUBIN:** You are going to separate us. Take us, too.Take us all. Show us what a big man you are. Take us all.  
**MR. DAVIS:** Mr. Rubin's wife they are now taking--  
**MR. RUBIN:** Keep your hands off her. You see them taking away my wife?  
**MR. DAVIS:** Why don't you gag the press, too, and the attorneys, gag them?

 I thought Jerry Rubin, Dellinger, and Hayden were fictionalized the most to their detriment. There were also significant others of the defendants that did a lot of the groundwork for them. Jerry wasn’t this lonely guy vulnerable to the feminine wiles of an FBI agent. That was fiction.

g9go47f,"I disagree entirely. You didn't get the film. Your finger is completely off the pulse of Americans and how things are being perceived and how things need to change in order bring about actual action and change. 

Aaron Sorkin is a widely respected political filmmaker whose voice is respected on political matters by numerous generations, especially the 40+ who grew up with the west wing. This exact demographic are the ones who are scared of today's protesters as right wing propaganda, conservatives, and traditionalists have successfully controlled the narrative involving police reform, combatting racism against blacks, and efforts to encourage police to respect the constitutional rights of Americans. These collective efforts are being demonized as being anything from ranging from being a communist plot to destroy the country, the lawless rioters, and looters. This is undeniably a gross misframing or disframing of the overwhelmingly peaceful protests that are occurring. 

This film was meant to tell the story of the Chicago 7 but also draw obvious parallels between the types of protesters that exist in today's world in order to shift public opinion on the BLM movement. All the efforts being fought for are being fought by ALL types of people, the black revolutionaries, the yuppies, the academics, the straight edge, the pacificists, etc. They are all fighting for the same cause though despite being radically different people with varying types of social acceptability to the conservative establishment or status quo class. 

This highly palatable and moving film humanizes the protesters in today's world and emphasizes the importance of voting. The release of this film is no mistake, two weeks before the election. This film is meant to get people out to vote in favor of these sorts, fighting for these causes. You can't have some hard r hated film where the racial realities of the time are being depicted in some visceral and vulgar way because that will harm the intention of the film. Your problem is that you wanted the intention to be something else than what it was and your intention is far less impactful than Aaron Sorkins' in regards to real world change such as increasing empathy for today's protesters and to get people out to vote. 


FYI, this wasn't some project handed down to him, this is something he wrote, directed, and produced, this was a passion project of his about a subject matter he hasn't really examined in past films. If someone like Spike Lee or Oliver Stone would have done this it would have been written off by the audience who needed to hear it and I don't think either of those two could have made this. The film wasn't about the Vietnam war and protesting it, the film was about protesters and how they are treated by the police, conservatives, and ""the establishment"". 

It is an ode to today's protesters and those who are afraid to speak out against the system. The audience is supposed to be Eddie Redmayne's character who doesn't respect the cultural shifts required to enact the change he wants, he is afraid to disrespect a corrupt and broken system that is deemed as the norm. The same can be said for all the proper educated people who are afraid to say ""radical"" things that are outside the status quo but share the same goals as those such as blm or antifa but disagree on methods. Most of the film going audience is indeed Eddie Redmayne's character they don't want racism against blacks, they don't want police beating the shit out of Americans, they want both stop or be reduced as much as possible. Many of them are probably sheltered as well and unaware that police are starting many of the ""riots"" or unrest we are seeing in the streets. 

 A valid criticism of a film can't ever be ""I wanted it to be about something else"", ""I wanted the intentions of the filmmaker to be something else"", etc. That is absurd. The filmmaker made the exact film he wanted to and it worked phenomenally. This film was meant to shift public opinion on today's protesters and to get people to vote against Trump and Republicans, it did a great job.",jcmq8s

Seale had an attorney but that man was in the hospital. Seale rejected Kunstler's offer thereafter because ***Seale was representing himself*** during the trial.

g95l74s,"I thought the film's centrist politics ultimately clashed with its portrayal of leftists. Its essentially an outsider looking in, a ""white moderate's"" take on protesting and activism. 

Ultimately, like most centrists, he's afraid of portraying radical politics at all, or failing that, in a good light. So of course he tones down the politics of many of the characters. Of course he portrays people to the left of him as ""not as sensible or agreeable"" because that is his ideology speaking - not any kind of objective fact. Of course he will make a milquetoast message of unity. Even portraying one side as ""pragmatic"" is an ideological statement, and assume they share the same goals when anyone with an understanding of history or politics can correctly identify the left and center as bitter political enemies. This kind of faulty political foundation is what the entire film stands on. 

And the movie suffered for it. I would have liked to actually see Hoffman's hostility to the court rather than the milquetoast we got. Sorkin's centrism ultimately whitewashes and sanitizes the whole affair. His insistence on ""showing good people on both sides"" with the prosecutor also muddles the message. Then you got Sorkin again touting the superiority of the serious, moderate liberal . . . in the context of 2020 when decades of serious, moderate liberal approach nothing has really changed. Plus the ending, by god the ending. Threw away the entire message of the movie to invent a feelgood scene where the good guys win and happily ever after.",jcmq8s

gf2uxu1,"""Is this a good movie or not"" -- to answer that question, I say that's entirely up to you! If you loved it, then you love it, I don't see anything wrong with that. That's the beauty of all art, we all take different things away from it.

I did think this movie was ""good,"" but I wouldn't go as far as to say it's ""great."" For context, the writer/director of this film Aaron Sorkin is known for his rapid-fire dialogue & wit. You know that conversations that he writes can't happen in real-life, it almost feels like music the way everything is paced. 

So to me, in The Social Network (not sure if you've seen that), that worked out perfectly because I think David Fincher found a way to make Sorkin's ""music"" really pop off the screen. But in The Trial of the Chicago 7 (I just watched this for the first time last night) it just felt a little too ""clean"" and vanilla, and I felt that there weren't too many creative risks to make the movie feel all the more profound. The beats happened exactly when they were supposed to -- I didn't feel the intensity that I thought I would have given the intense subject matter. 

But the actors' performances I thought were pretty great (special shoutouts to Sacha Baron Cohen & Yahya Abdul-Mateen). 

All in all, I did like this movie, but wouldn't be running to the hills saying it's one of the best movies of 2020. Though the timeliness & relevance of this movie works in its favor -- it packs a bit more of a punch now than if it were released 10 years ago.",jcmq8s

Having the protesters try to take the hill, instead of them already being on the hill and getting beat by the cops, muddies the water on whether or not they started the riots. Of course the movie itself has a part where they literally say the cops started it, so I hope that's what most people take away from it.

g9gqqx9,">  I think putting a liberal “good guys always win by taking the moral high ground” spin

You didn't get the film and your understanding of American politics is wrong. There is this imaginary split between ""leftists"", ""liberals"", and ""progressives""  produced by far left wing narrative driven information sources that have no journalistic integrity(young tturks, jacobin, intercept, etc) when we are all on the same side with the same goals on cultural issues(race, race equality, feminism, lgbt rights, religious acceptance). That is what the film was about, that there are all these disparate views among the left all with varying approaches to accomplishing the same goals and varying relationships to the government. The historic aspects of it were all done on purpose to serve this message. 

Heydan's character in the film was meant to represent probably what you perceive to be a ""liberal"" or a person who cares about winning elections to actually enact policy, those who are straight edge and not willing to get arrested or do ""improper"" things for the cause. This whole film was directed to what you call ""liberals"" I think, or people who proudly call themselves Democrats who are older who may view the protests as involving ""looters"", ""rioters"", ""criminals"", as opposed to people fighting against an oppressive system for a good cause. The radical revisionism was meant to help today's protesters and today's struggles and this is easily Sorkin's most radical work. His intentions are to make the American public today more understanding of the protesters today because he is our side. The solidarity experienced by those in the film despite their radically different backgrounds and relationships to government is what is needed today among the left in order to enact change. That was Sorkin's message. It was not supposed to be accurate at all, the Vietnam war opposition was just a vehicle to communicate the themes and message of the film. 

There is a reason it was as ahistoric as it was. This was sorkin's way of humanizing blm and antifa among left wing people who may view them as scary and not be understanding and to get people out to vote. I think this is the most timely and important films Sorkin has produced. We are all on the same side with roughly the same goals. The film was pushing those ""straight edge"" left wing people to be about it, which I think many of people who identify as ""radical leftists"" erroundeously think we are not just because we are concerned about winning elections in order bring about actual change.",jcmq8s
gbfaqab,"Abbie wanted to focus more on changing culture through his monologues and mass gatherings in order to end the war, and facilitate a cultural shift in the country.

Tom Hayden recognized that even if you change the culture itself, you still need the legislative power to make real systemic change.  That's why he says he isn't looking to end the war.  He's certainly passionate about trying to end the conflict, but it's just one objective of a grand plan to work from w/i the framework of the system to make positive changes.  Ending the war itself doesn't change Nixon being in power, or his subordinates carrying out his will.

But then several minutes of real time go by where other machinations of the trial (many of them absurd) are going on, the idea simply slipped out of his mind, his rising was nothing more than muscle memory. Hoffman and Rubin were the ones of the 7 whose full intention was to play up every possible circus aspect of the trial, so of course the plan never left their minds for a second once originated. Hayden was the one more than any of them that was trying to also ""properly"" engage with the trial as a key defendant, it's the most understandable thing in the world he could've momentarily just spaced about it and stood out of habit.

Nor did Seale tell the judge to go fuck himself, but he did call him a racist, fascist pig. And yes, Seale repeatedly interrupted to demand that he be represented, and say that his constitutional rights were being ignored, but the judge continued to insist that Seale had representation.

>Seale himself described in detail in an interview with Democracy Now just how much of an ordeal it was. He described his head being wrapped so only his eyes and nose were visible while his legs were tied with bandages. On the final day he was gagged, he said he began losing blood pressure and circulation to his arms and was carried out of the courtroom by the guards.

The Social Network erases Mark Zuckerberg's real life wife (who worked for early Facebook) and makes the original rating site more sexist than it was (it actually rated both genders, but the movie makes it seem like it just rated women).  The movie is trying to comment on sexism.... by making real people more sexist than they were, which is an odd choice.

In the Chicago 7, Daphne is fictional (all the undercover officers were men) and I seriously doubt that flag girl thing happened.  The flag girl scene feels very crafted for our time and of course, exists to show us how woke a male character is (rather than empowering flag girl herself).

g945nz5,"I think you might be oversimplifying a bit, but I’m not disagreeing with your overall point. The crux of the ending is Tom Hayden realizing that this is a political trial and choosing to not try and save himself and make them look clean and presentable, but to stir up the crowd with Vietnam-name reading and accept their personal sentences, since he realized that Abbie was right when he pointed out Hayden’s arrogance at believing only they can change the system and they need to moderate themselves until that happens. 

I honestly saw it more as Tom Hayden being an entry point for establishment-types to see the benefit of activism and bold public actions. Abbie Hoffman was a bit more of a sage-type who is painted as right for abandoning those legalese arguments about their defense (“our blood”, “the riots were a voter registration drive”) and instead leaning into the political shitshow side of things. I’m making this movie sound more leftist than I think it was I think, but I don’t think it’s quite as centrist as you’re painting it.",jcmq8s

I think the reason so many people don't like that ending is that not much has changed since then. I think the ending works well in a vacuum (it's a pretty well executed feel good ending imo), but like with something like Green Book, it has this ""the good guys won, bad guys lost"" tone that we know isn't true. Yeah, the judge lost his reputation and the Chicago 7 got retried and got out of prison earlier, but none of the systematic problems have been solved. The larger bad guys behind the scenes didn't really lose here.

I think they should've replaced it with Kunstler's real speech (which was posted in another reply in this thread) which would've still retained some of the optimism of the ending we got but also given us something to think about.

g96hciq,"I think part of the reason the good guys had a messy and unclear message is that they weren't all part of a unified organization with a singular method, although their ultimate goal of ending the war was the same.

It is very clear the message the movie is trying to convey is that political opposition can easily become criminalized when you have an inherently corrupt and flawed system.  There were plenty of actors on the side of the government that could have and should have done something differently, from the Department of Justice to the Judiciary.  And yet, despite obvious wrongdoings, malfeasance, lies, and corruption they didn't just let it happen, but actively participated in it.",jcmq8s
g96kk99,">but then the good guys have a messy and unclear message,

I agree with you and it's because (imo) Sorkin's politics differs too much from the revolutionaries that were put on trial. The scenes where Abbie Hoffman spoke to the prosecutor outside the museum where he said ""you're a good guy you're just doing your job"" and the scene where he was testifying and said ""we have great systems just bad people in them"" don't mesh with the person's actual politics, but they're Sorkin putting them into the movie. 

He tries to do this dance where his politics are as radical as the people he is trying to potray and it just muddies the waters.",jcmq8s
g968z8n,"You might have missed a couple things that probably would have cleared everything up for you. The message of the movie is: the US justice system is so flawed that protesting a government that sends young people off to die in a war is considered criminal, even though it is within our rights. We’re supposed to identify with the victims of a corrupt system who only wanted to express their ideas peacefully but were attacked, charged, denied representation, and made to look like violent criminals to the public. The good-guys’ message was anti-war and anti-death. The anti-war stuff did take a backseat as the film shifted focus from their activism to their trial. They were not convicted; the ruling was overturned. Hope that wasn’t too long! :D",jcmq8s

On Oct. 15, 1969, the defendants did attempt to observe the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam by reading the names of some of the war dead from both sides, but it seems to have been David Dellinger actually reading the names. (Abbie Hoffman got into a tug of war with a marshal trying to confiscate the North Vietnamese flag he’d brought.) Hayden gave two allocution statements during the trial—one for the initial charges and one for the contempt charges Hoffman brought—and used both to give speeches, but didn’t speak about the war dead.
In real life, Rennie did not keep a notebook in which he recorded the names of all the Americans killed in the Vietnam War since he was arrested; that was invented to set up Tom Hayden’s big scene.

Sorkin had the opportunity to show that it doesn't matter if you are a ""clean cut"" family-man who swears off any form of violence - you will be viewed in the same company of what they consider radical troublemakers. 

But instead Sorkin has Dellinger abandon a cornerstone of his moral identity and adds a scene of his son looking on teary-eyed in disapproval.

g92lvdf,"There's a paper on the subject from 1980, if you have time for a longread. [Part one](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2230.1980.tb01585.x) and [Part two](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2230.1980.tb01594.x). It's British but discusses U.S. cases and court proceedings around the world. Here's a TL;DR from my readthrough.

* There have been a few high-profile cases where the defendant was exceptionally disruptive. Bobby Seale's was one, Charles Manson's trial was another.
* In theory the defendant can be removed and the trial can proceed without them if they won't stop being disruptive, but this basically never happens.
* One time when this did happen was a 19th century court case where a defendant (who appears to have been mentally ill) was so disruptive that he was taken away and brought back to the court room in irons, similar to Bobby Seale. But he kept yelling and stamping his feet so in the end they excluded him from the rest of the trial.
* The paper suggests that if a defendant is removed from a trial they could be allowed to take part in the trial remotely (being apprised of what's being said and allowed to communicate with their lawyer). The paper weighs the pros and cons of a video/sound relay (basically taking part in the trial over Zoom).
* Another possibility weighed in the paper is that as long as the defendant's lawyer is still present in the court room, they can be considered to be fairly represented even if they're not there themselves. Obviously this doesn't apply in Bobby Seale's case since the whole point was that he wasn't being allowed legal representation.
* Since most disruptions are done for show (especially in political trials), one potentially effective option would be to clear the court room instead of removing the defendant. Once the defendant no longer has an audience to perform to, they may settle down. However, trying to hold a ""secret trial"" would come with its own set of ethical problems.

The short answer is that in theory the court is within its rights to restrain the defendant or to remove them from the court room entirely, and the second option is the one that's most commonly taken. But this is a very uncommon situation anyway. In most cases the defendant's lawyer will be the first person telling them to sit down and shut up, and defendants are generally looking to avoid contempt of court charges.",jcmq8s

This directly led to the cops taking off their badges and beating Eddie and co. through the restaurant window.

You know who the people who watched The West Wing are supporting in this election and likely every election over the last twenty years? The Democrat or other left leaning candidate. Just because someone is older than 40 doesn't mean they're a conservative. Go to any protest happening in your city. You'll see a shit load of grey hairs there. This idea that old people are the problem and young people are the solution needs to die. I don't want to blow your mind but there are loads and loads of shitty young people too.

Hoffman and the 7 were revolutionary counter-culture icons that used the trial to push how fucked the system was and how the Vietnam War had corrupted the nation. I didn’t WANT this to be something else. The story IS something else entirely. 

Sorkin could have framed it all in a way that honored the actual history AND worked to show the system is corrupt and that the protestors and progressives were on their side. But instead he CHOSE to present an alternate series of events that undermines what this movement actually was.

g92hq0m,"I think this is the sort of true story that is very well suited to Sorkin's style, because it's one where the ""good guys"" win in the end by maintaining the moral high ground, and the ""bad guys"" end up losing because the wider audience of the world sees their bad behavior for what it is. That's a very reductive summary but it's basically what happened with the Trial of the Chicago 7 - the convictions all got overturned because the judge was so demonstrably biased.

Even though it's based on a true story, it's got that Sorkin fantasy/wish fulfilment/escapist flavor to it. And honestly I'm fine with a slice of that kind of escapism in a world where people keep doing terrible stuff in plain view and getting away with it.",jcmq8s

The characters were certainly more glossy and Hollywood than their real-life counterparts. Ideologically speaking too, as you say.

Personally, I felt that being less dogmatic in its representation of The Chicago Eight and espousing any one voice as 'the correct one' helped convey the message of the film. Maybe the choice to try and make Shultz sympathetic in the end did a feel a little forced and schlocky, but would that many people have really sat out on the honouring of dead teenage soldiers? (In a courtroom? Quite possibly.) That said, I didn't find Hoffman to be 'less agreeable' than Hayden, nor any of the main eight any more-or-less sensible than the rest. Perhaps others would feel more passionately opposed to one over the other, though I fear those viewers may have their own biases and missed the point somewhat, in a similar vein to someone who watches and roots for the prosecutors.

Of course, that's all relative to what you think the film's ultimate message is. I can't say I share your sentiment on the left and centre being 'bitter enemies', but I suppose our understanding of that point hinges on our own selective definitions of each term.  
For example, I'm no great fan of neoliberalism or communism. I say I'm a centrist in so much as I'm very wary about factional politics and radicals, which is not to say I always disagree with them. I also said it at the end as a funny little joke.",jcmq8s
gnhik6u,">	Of course he portrays people to the left of him as ""not as sensible or agreeable"" because that is his ideology speaking - not any kind of objective fact. 

This wasn’t really my takeaway at all. He gives Hoffman the last word in the argument between him and Hayden, and I felt like he was allowing Hoffman a slight victory by revealing him as more serious and strategic than he initially lets on.",jcmq8s
ggw04k1,"I think there is something to be said about how both Hoffman and Hayden received the same sentence. So it doesn't matter if you are an idealist like Hoffman or a pragmatist like Hayden, if you're a left wing, you'll always be the enemy of the right wing. I even thought the movie, and by extension Sorkin, was trying to communicate with the fictional ending that since both liberal pragmatists and liberal disrupters constantly face opposition and persecution by the right, you might as well be a disrupter, as seen by the pragmatist Hayden finally becoming the disrupter.",jcmq8s

Just occurred at an earlier time. It was cut off by the judge, as is totally believable. By many accounts, the judge was worse than what the film showed. Also, the prosecutor was not known to be sympathetic to the defendants. Bobby Seale, the chairman of the black panthers, was in reality bound and gagged in a US district court room for THREE DAYS before his mistrial. Abbie Hoffman was a huge antagonist and even more so than the film showed. In many ways, the movie dulled down how truly dramatic this case was. In others, it was dramatized.

No mention of the devastation to the Vietnamese people, you know, a big reason why people were anti-war?

To be honest, if you look into the ""true story"" very much a lot of this movie is pretty bullshit. I thought it was decent, but it's one of those rare and sad cases where the real story is actually much crazier than what's in the movie. So many of the antics of the seven were ignored. 

I think a major issue that the movie doesn't really address is that most of them immediately knew that with such a biased judge they would be convicted no matter what they did. Abbie at least absolutely understood this. So their main goal most of the trial was just to show how ridiculous the trial was, they didn't really care about the result because they mostly saw that as a foregone conclusion. While this was kind of covered in the movie, most of their antics weren't really.

He actually spends most of the time attempting to give constructive advice to the defendant while advising him of his rights and the pertinent rules of the proceedings.

1 - The way Sorkin develops Hayden as a sympathetic liberal, pushing against the Rubin/Hoffman's attention-seeking behaviour, embodying a ""respectable"" liberal conscience vs. the outlandish radicals. It's true that Hayden was a bit more moderate or calculated than the Yippies but it wasn't like it was in the film. Sorkin uses that relationship so he can given speeches about the necessity of pragmatic electoralism and having a good public image. This obviously is intended to be commentary on contemporary progressive politics too. Also, Hayden wasn't the one who read out the names of the dead, that was Dellinger (who is not treated fairly in this film), and he didn't just read out the names of the US dead, he read out the names of Vietnamese dead too. That is another thing -- like a lot of American movies about the war, including anti-war ones, the Vietnamese victims are not given appropriate attention.

2 - The depiction of the lead prosecutor as a man doing his job against his will and struggling with the inner turmoil. This dynamic seems to be manufactured out of whole cloth so Sorkin can suggest that there are good people on the inside who are just doing their jobs. In reality, Schultz was the government's pitbull and he had no qualms about this. You can read [this recent interview with him](https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/prosecutor-recalls-chaotic-scene-at-1969-chicago-7-trial/2354703/) where he states this plainly:

>  Schultz firmly rejects the notion that the defendants in the case were wrongly accused, or the folk heroes that some have painted them as in ensuing years.

> ""They were violent, they were revolutionaries, and they wanted to destroy our federal government.""

But they were. These weren’t liberals who decided to protest the war, these were committed anti capitalists who had worked together to help people survive in a capitalist world and get by. They were radicals. They were the antithesis of Sorkin. And they weren’t just protesting the war: they were in Chicago to protest the DNC nominating a pro war candidate and their support for the war. 

Different viewpoints being healthy is one thing, but a writer fictionalising a real event by changing the politics to suit his outlook is awful. 

Aaron Sorkin is best when he can write his politics, which are the liberal ideas of civil, intellectual democracy and debate. This is why everyone in his works talk like they do: he doesn’t write arguments, he writes debates. And he does it brilliantly. But applying ideals of civil debate to people who were brutalised by police and spent their trial mocking the justice system and manipulating the media brilliantly to cancel out the sham they were being made to carry out is pathetic. Imagine writing a Joe Biden film where he’s portrayed as a radical running to tear down the system. It’s laughable.",jcmq8s

The way the movie and ending was written though I *completely* got the parallels and dread of how much is the same today in the US, so like I said it worked for me and I loved it.

g94dl42,I think there should have been a scene in between Hoffman on the stand and Hayden reading the names.

g96bfdl,"I can understand the music comment.  During the reading of the names I just remember the music being a bit too loud, but recall it feeling “triumphant” to match everyone standing up in respect, and getting at least a small one over on that asshole judge for a moment. 

I don’t remember the music past that.  The notes at the end were pretty sad, and the facts setting in that not much has changed int he last 50 years left me feeling a general sadness.  I liked the name thing though. 

I will check what that upbeat song you are talking about. I remember someone else saying the credit song was a “banger” so maybe that is the one and I would agree peppy wouldn’t be the right type of song!  I know it would have been on the nose, but I would have chosen a song from that time period and even one of the ones about the Chicago 7 (like the song Chicago by Graham Nash... tells the story but has some hope in the chorus too).  

I just looked up the credit song and it is by Celeste who wrote all the soundtrack music and the main song “Hear My Voice” has been submitted for the Oscar of best original song.  It has a retro vibe to it but it’s modern too.  I will have to take a listen in the context of the end when I watch the movie again and see what I think. Thanks for sharing your opinion!",jcmq8s

g9t4ebu,">The message of the movie is: the US justice system is so flawed that protesting a government that sends young people off to die in a war is considered criminal, even though it is within our rights.

That's not the message of the movie at all lol, the message of the movie, like all of Sorkin's political output, is that 'the system' works and is good but can be bent (temporarily) towards evil by bad people. Hoffman, IRL a radical who wanted an actual revolution, outright says so in the movie.

I agree that we're supposed to identify with the defendants, but Sorkin can't help but turn these characters into empty shells so he can stuff them full of his own, incredibly weak centrist Democratic ideology. The whole point of the Hoffman's antics was to show what a joke and farce the trial had been from the beginning, but all Sorkin can think about is making this an argument against those nasty loud progressives/leftists ruining elections for reasonable pragmatists like himself (in the form of Hayden).

Like, he even turns a complete right-wing shithead like Schultz into a sympathetic character just so he can show that it's not the justice *system* that's the problem. He intentionally moves the death of Fred Hampton's assassination around by several months so that he can portray Bobby Seale's outbursts and anger as being motivated by grief and not his radical criticism *of the system itself*. The height of Sorkin's political imagination is voting ('overthrowing the government' lmao) every four years. Altho Hoffman should have really said every two years, can't forget about the midterms as a good Democrat!

It's an entertaining movie with some fine performances, but you gotta switch off your brain if you don't want to get mad at it because Aaron Sorkin has very limited imagination and can't help insert himself into his work in the most grating, ham-fisted way.",jcmq8s

I say give me that end moment to cry and to focus on what the film was about for those men in that time.  Of course it’s more complicated than just opposing the Vietnam war, as the movie showed, but for me it worked.

Hoffman could have explained that Hayden subsequently told him this (which is allowable hearsay as Hayden and Hoffman are co-conspirators in the alleged crime).

They didn’t know and Sorkin didn’t know what the last six months would be like. But also, they DID know, and it’s the brilliance of the script by Sorkin.  it’s reality NOW and the rest of us just got a front row seat to the reality this movie portrays.

gbmad4s,"This might make you (slightly) happy then. First, society is changed, and the majority would now agree with the defendants.

Secondly, a majority of professionals hated the man and even the state mostly benched him in the end. From Wiki:

*In 1974, author Joseph Goulden wrote a book called The Benchwarmers, which was an exposé of the powerful and often private world of federal judges. Goulden conducted an in-depth investigation of Judge Hoffman and pointed out that he had an abrasive reputation among Chicago lawyers even before his most famous case. Goulden mentioned a survey that had been done among Chicago attorneys who had recently appeared before the judge and 78% had an unfavorable opinion of him. They responded overwhelmingly negatively to the questions, ""Does he display an impartial attitude?"" and ""Is he courteous to both the prosecution and defense?""*

*In 1982, the Executive Committee of the United States District Court ordered that Hoffman not be assigned any new cases because of his age and complaints that he was acting erratically and abusively from the bench. However, he continued to preside over his ongoing cases until his death from natural causes the next year, a week before his 88th birthday*

Further:

""*The Seventh Circuit reversed all of the convictions in 1972, ruling that the judge’s “deprecatory and often antagonistic attitude toward the defense is evident in the record from the very beginning. It appears in remarks and actions both in the presence and absence of the jury.”""*

And us being who we are... What memory of this man will be imprinted in our collective knowledge, if any? The movie version, it's the movie version. He was a power hungry, ridculously biased shit-heel on the wrong side of history, and if remembered at all, he will be remembered as such.

g9h89tq,">  I thought the popularity and ubiquity of Bernie Sanders would have put this debate to rest.

I am not going to share my facebook of course but one thing I said when I went to the Sanders rally in my city was, ""this rally has changed my life, brought me to tears, but there are too many young people, young people don't vote Sanders is going to lose"". I voted for Hillary against Sanders and supported Warren over Sanders. There were very very very small amount of people of white hair at my rally and I know for a fact that was the same all over the country. 

> I'm sorry but your age is showing. I'm really getting fed up with this blanket ageist bias.

I don't even know what this means but I am in my mid 30s. I oppose ageism incredibly. Simple fact is young people don't vote so Sorkin appealing to the demographic that votes to communicate a message that they need to hear in order to respect today's protesters is not very ageist I think. 

> . You know who the people who watched The West Wing are supporting in this election and likely every election over the last twenty years? The Democrat or other left leaning candidate.

Of course, I was raised off west wing... the fact of the matter is that demographic can be easily scared into not respecting the blm movement and its goals or the cultural goals of antifa even though they share them. Right wing media has successfully painted blm as rioters, looters, and criminals even the opposite is true. 

> The problem is old ideas not old people. And old ideas can be held by a person of any age. Just as young ideas can be held by a person of any age.

I agree but old people are more likely to hold old ideas and young people are more likely to hold young ideas, even though as you said ideas can be held by anyone. We are products of our environment of our times. There is a narrative and theory out there that once the baby boomers die their ideas will die with them and a progressive revolution will occur, I see the right wing youth now and I see that is a fool hardy theory, that proves your main idea absolutely correct. Old ideas can undeniably be held by the youth but I think they are in their death throws, that is why right wing extremism is on the rise and these groups like proud boys, patriot prayer, etc are emerging as socially accepted forces by conservatives. 

Aaron Sorkin has been one of the most influential left wing minds I think in modern history for his sheer impact on indoctrinating people to hold classy, sensible, left wing values. That is why I found this film personally very refreshing as it is obvious attempt, and what it actually is, to humanize and non demonize people who he thinks the children of his ideas may be hesitant to accept as one of their own since they are generally older. I consider myself generally older and th. Our reddit profiles are generally of the same age, I think you mistook my rational analysis of the positive impact this film will have on the voting demographic with ageism. I think this is Sorkin's most important work easily because after this election it will have tremendous consequences even though when I am sure as a kid I had no clue how bills were made and the power structures that existed that restrained what they did or did not do.

Ageism is an issue. I look young so I do take ageism as an incredibly serious bias.",jcmq8s

You being a communist I would expect more in regards to praxis, it isn't about an accurate understanding of history. There are documentaries for that and we already have countless anti vietnam movies showing the struggle such as Born on the Fourth of July. You are saying you want to compromise praxis, real world change just so that you can have a more accurate portrayal of events...

It was ahistoric to show how everyone had to compromise their core identities in order to achieve the greater good that they all believed in. That his why hoffman spoke about voting be a form of revolution, heydan spoke disrespected the system and started advocating for blood on the streets, delinger breaking his anti peace, the nerdy kid with the glasses assaulting a cop, and I am sure there were other examples of that from the other main characters. We can't be dogmatic about methods within reason in order to achieve our shared goals. I think that is what you are not doing now, you have have this slavish respect for truth even though it harms today's ""counter-culture"" and the tangible differences it is trying to make today. 

I would bet money all of those part of that trial would approve of the intentions and effects of this film and wouldn't mind their likenesses/names being used for it. Also people are going to look into who these people were afterwards, the ones who really care to be informed and were moved, the mass man would have probably just turned off this film it were too factually accurate and those on the right who need to see this film would have just wrote it off as some leftist circlejerk. Again, the only thing that matters, and the themes are what change behavior, the themes are what make people go down the rabbit hole, the themes are what cause people vote for change, the themes are what are going to break people out of their comfort zones and start paying attention to the arguments being presented by blm and antifa as opposed to the common narratives in media. You are truly belittling this film in an insanely counter productive way simply because it wasn't the film you wanted it to be. This is Aaron Sorkin making revolutionary cinema that will bring about real change. I don't think you understand the value of film in producing behavior and defining ones outlook, I have studied some critical theory so that is a tad off that you would also not value the transformative nature of film and only see it as a vehicle in which information/facts are passed on. 

Stanley Kubrick said something akin to if you want to change behavior and make an impact you don't directly tell the audience what to think but you do it through making them feel the themes you wish to pass on and make it ambiguous enough to where the audience makes it their own. 

I did send you a private message and would be willing to have a more fluid back and forth conversation about how to bring about progressive or leftist change. I did take a couple classes on Marxism at a good university with a leading marxist so I am not ignorant of the arguments for or against. My deal is about bringing about real change that improves the quality of life of people without causing unnecessary suffering and death. I identify with Heydon in the film, but probably not so much in real life.

I agree with your post, but I do so relcutantly. I can forgive most changes for movie/ drama sake. The cheesy ending is fine to me. It's all mostly fine, the message remains mostly the same. Creative liberty and all that.

But the one thing I HATED, truly, truly hated was the scene in which Dellinger hit a Bailiff. The man never did that. He was as much a steadfast pacifist as he claimed to be. Why was this complete fabrication necessary? For additional drama? Wasn't there enough drama? Did we really need a regretful shot of his son for this movie to work? It lessens the memory of a man that was just what he said a was, and that happens to be something we should all aspire to be.

When a student, he *did* hit a man. Which *led* to him becoming a pacifist. This is what he said at a later time about that event: 

*''I shall never forget the horror I felt the instant my fist struck solid flesh. When my victim fell, I dropped to my knees, lifted his head and I cradled him until he came to. I walked him home. I never saw my enemy again.''*

That man lived his live as a pacifist from then on. He never broke. FFS he stayed active his entire life. He joined protests at the *very next* Chicago Democratic Convention in 1996 and was promptly arrested *again* for taking part in a sit-in. That man is a legend and an inspiration!

Read up on the guy, he has his flaws but he lived an *exceptional* life!!! And for that reason that single scene just pisses me off to no end. It stains that mans memory all while being wholly unnecessary.

I am ""pro war""/""interventionalism"" somewhat but that is only after I studied international relations and understood the nature of how civilizations and countries interact with one another. If you don't prepare for war you will subjugated and told what to do by other countries, that is just an inconvenient fact of life. 

So whatever economic system you produce it must be able to sustainably and continually finance a war machine powerful enough to not be told what to do by other countries. That is just a reality. That has never changed throughout human history. I protested the Iraq war in college, shortly after I changed my views on the subject. I feel as if you all are clinging onto a time long past that has no relation today's world in regards to war. Everything else I agree with with exception of revolution and violent means to enact law.

It's primarily been liberals, because they either provided cover for the right-wing or actively participated in it while trying to co-opt leftist movements.

When Black Lives Matter actually started protesting around Ferguson, it was liberals throwing the movement under the bus with conservatives when riots broke out. They were defending the police and leaning on the same respectability politics they claim to hate now. And I can guarantee you that if Hillary was in office, these same liberals would be doing exactly the same thing. It would have never occurred to Spielberg to reach out to Sorkin to write this thing; Sorkin had no fucking clue about the Chicago 7 until earlier this year, and it shows.

The same kind of bullshit center-left crap that Sorkin wrote into The West Wing, The Newsroom, etc., would put him on the side of Daley were he old enough then to be participating in the convention. Tom Hayden would have hated Sorkin and all the shit liberals now thinking that this trial would have meant anything to them if they couldn't shoehorn it into the Trump era. It's the same liberals who appear to give a shit about immigrants nowadays, but couldn't give less of a shit when Hillary had refugees deported back to Honduras. I didn't see these Sorkin-liberals at any of the protests years ago when we were opposing ICE raids in the early 2000s, when they were detaining immigrants without trial and doing smash-and-grab jobs on the regular.

You should read some of the court transcripts. The real trial was just as wild as it is in the movie. Arguably more so. From when Ginsberg was on the stand:

> THE COURT: You will have to cease that disrespectful tone.

> MR. KUNSTLER: That is not disrespect, that is an angry tone, your Honor.

> THE COURT: Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  I will grant the motion of the Government.

> MR. KUNSTLER: You refused us five minutes the other day.

> THE COURT: You are shouting at the Court.

> MR. KUNSTLER: Oh, your Honor---

> THE COURT: I never shouted at you during this trial.

> MR. KUNSTLER: Your Honor, your voice has been raised.

> THE COURT: You have been disrespectful.

> MR. KUNSTLER: It is not disrespectful, your Honor.

> THE COURT: And sometimes worse than that.

> THE WITNESS: O-o-m-m-m-m-m-m-m.

> THE COURT: Will you step off the witness stand?

> MR. KUNSTLER: He was trying to calm us both down, your Honor.

> THE COURT: Oh, no. I needed no calming down. That will be all.

From when Abbie Hoffman was on the stand:

> MR. WEINGLASS: Taking you back to the spring of 1960, approximately May 1, 1960, will you tell the Court and jury where you were?

> MR. SCHULTZ: 1960?

> THE WITNESS: That's right.

> MR. SCHULTZ: Objection.

> THE COURT: I sustain the objection.

> MR. WEINGLASS: Your Honor, that date has great relevance to the trial.  May 1, 1960, was this witness' first public demonstration.  I am going to bring him down through Chicago.

> THE COURT: Not in my presence, you are not going to bring him down.  I sustain the objection to the question.

> THE WITNESS: My background has nothing to do with my state of mind?

> THE COURT: Will you remain quiet while I am making a ruling?  I know you have no respect for me.

> MR. KUNSTLER: Your Honor, that is totally unwarranted.  I think your remarks call for a motion for a mistrial.

> THE COURT: And your motion calls for a denial of the motion.  Mr. Weinglass, continue with your examination.

> MR. KUNSTLER: You denied my motion?  I hadn't even started to argue it.

> THE COURT: I don't need any argument on that one.  The witness turned his back on me while he was on the witness stand.

> THE WITNESS: I was just looking at the pictures of the long hairs up on the wall . . . . 

The judge's conduct during the trial was one of the reasons why the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the convictions:

> ""Most significant, however, were remarks in the presence of the jury, deprecatory of defense counsel and their case. These comments were often touched with sarcasm, implying rather than saying outright that defense counsel was inept, bumptious, or untrustworthy, or that his case lacked merit. Sometimes the comment was not associated with any ruling in ordinary course; sometimes gratuitously added to an otherwise proper ruling; nearly always unnecessary.""",jcmq8s

I'm going to respectfully disagree. There is a whole swath of middle-America out there right now who would fail to see the parallels between that moment and ours.

An example of a completely opposite approach would be the ending of *BlacKkKlansman,* in which I think Spike Lee understood that moderate Americans' blindness to their own role in history could only be met with an incredibly abrasive illustration to the contrary.

It is revealed Redmayne misspoke due to grammar vagueness (Cohen literally gives a little monologue about it), and didn’t mean for his line at the protest to come out the way it did. The misspoken line directs the protestors to march on, where they meet the cops, which leads them to find the unblocked bridge, which then leads them to getting beat up at the restaurant.

If Joe biden is supposed to represent the people of the democratic party (Wich he doesn't, I still remain convinced that the democratic party committed election fraud to circumvent bernie) then the party is rotten throughout with right wing ideology.

I mean this mostly in an economic sense, I don't think Joe biden is a bad, evil hearted person. He just happened to come of age and grow up in a world consumed with neo-liberalism. The ideology was so popular that it even caught on among left leaning people in the wake of the red scare and its very understandable. It's based on a lot of cool and pretty mathematics that would convince most people, even people today who've seen what the chicago school of economics has unleashed upon the world.

They're responsible for terrible atrocities in most of the world and it's just today we're finally seeing the world come around and realize what's been going on.

Radicals, short for radical leftists, range anywhere from full on communists and anarchists all the way to market socialists (who believe in a market based economy with worker owned corporations) while liberals are ""leftists"" who still buy into neo liberal economic theory.

Radicals and liberals might agree on a social justice policy, ie. Gay marriage, abortion rights and basic human decency though, so not all hope is lost.

To have the main characters overcome that by winning the crowd does a disservice to the reality that there are systems of power that are unfair against minorities and fringe groups.

Personally I'd also implement judicial terms. I'd rather they be kept open to periodic re-appointment, but you can even go so far as to implement formal term limits if you want. Terms don't necessarily have to be short either. I'm actually a dual citizen and in my other country on our equivalent of the Supreme Court, justices serve a nine-year term of office. (They also have a limit of a single term, which I'm not a fan of) You could take it just a hair further and implement a ten-year term. It doesn't completely divorce the appointment from politics, but a decade is a long time. It would give them more freedom than a shorter term and on the political front, if they come up to re-appointment, in ten years political winds could just have easily have shifted back in their favor as against. For instance, a Republican judge appointed by Bush in 2003 would've been eligible to be replaced by Obama in 2013, but one appointed in 2007 would've come back up under Trump. 

Having the term expire and come up for reappointment would also be a relatively simple way to remove problematic judges. Realistically this probably isn't how it would've played out, but just looking at the dates: Hoffman was appointed in 53. With a ten-year term he would've come up in 63 and then again in 73.
