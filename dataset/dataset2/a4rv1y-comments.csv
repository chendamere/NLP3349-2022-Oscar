ebsd026,"One scene that really sticks with me is when [Cleo went to find Fermin at the karate training ground, and the odd martial arts teacher did the pose that he said only the strongest people could do... but Cleo did it with ease.] (#spoiler)   I took this as a sign that she had the internal strength to deal with everything she was going to experience throughout the rest of the film.

Anyways, completely immersive movie. So beautifully shot. My favorite of the year.",a4rv1y
ebui19d,"I really enjoyed it. I read somewhere that this film was the director/creator’s “love letter to the women in his life.”

I am a woman, and a mother, so certain things I was able to understand and feel deeply.

I was raised by a maid in Venezuela, so I really connected with Cleo and how much she loved the kids, who in turn also loved her very much. Those women work very hard, for little pay, from sun up til sun down. Not a glamorous job, but a very important one.

Several things I noticed....the whole concept of women being all alone...it was the women who ran the family. The husband just showed up when he felt like it. The fact that everyone babied the youngest child made me think of how women might have a bit of a hand in raising these “spoiled” men.

I was struck by the fact that even though the family claimed to love Cleo, they don’t treat her equally. In the scene where they are sitting in the bench eating ice cream, Cleo is standing while everyone is sitting. A sign of how her struggle and pain is unacknowledged. She is there to work.

The dogs throughout the film made me think of the loyalty of women, especially the maids. They put up with a lot of shit from their husbands/employers.

The ocean scene showed me that Cleo loved those kids enough to risk her own life for them. As I watched them bobbing up and down it made me think that the family (Cleo included) could weather any storm, as long as they were together.

I thought it was funny that the husband took the bookcases. What’s a bookcase without books? Nothing. Just empty space. The heart of the bookcase are the books.  The heart of the home is the family. The husband left and took only the empty shell, leaving behind the one thing that gave his life any value—his family.",a4rv1y
ebs4uwy,I saw this in theaters almost two weeks ago and I firmly believe that the *spoiler* the riot scene is one of the best shots of recent history. The way the riot breaks out through the window and then transitions into the inside of the mattress store all in one shot is masterful.,a4rv1y
ebssizx,"I have never sobbed because of a movie before but Cleo's delivery scene reduced me to shambles. It wasn't just the fact that her baby girl was born dead, but the casual, almost anesthetized manner in which the doctors and nurses talked to her. I completely lost it when they asked Cleo if she would like to meet her daughter and then that it was time to say goodbye almost immediately after.   


On a lighter note, one of my favorite shots was the single take, 360 degree pan of Cleo turning off all the lights in the house before going to bed. It was a beautiful, nuanced scene, showing all of the little things that servants do to keep a household running. We often forget how much work it takes to maintain a home, from doing the dishes to cleaning up after children and pets. ",a4rv1y
ebsld6r,"I watched this movie with my mother in theaters, and it was one of best bonding moments we had recently. She was raised near Colonia Roma, where this movie takes place. She cried three times in this movie. According to her, how this movie sets the 1970s setting was beautiful. She told me that watching this film was like watching a memory of hers play on the screen. ",a4rv1y
ebtli1b,For the first half you’re like ok this is going to be a really well-shot art film slash character study then Cuarón is like bitch you thought,a4rv1y
ebt9yzo,"I loved Cleo’s dynamic with little Pepe. He was such a sweetie. Also really liked how the mother had these outbursts and flaws but ultimately was such a kind, compassionate, and strong figure. ",a4rv1y
ebscbn2,"There's so many shots in this film that make you think ""How the hell did they pull this off?"" Not just the big, showy long takes, like the fire or the massacre. But the little things, too, like the reflection of an airplane framed perfectly in a puddle of water during the opening credits, or a little horned frog skittering along the ground in close-up.

This movie is filled with little touches like that, that make it feel real in every way. The way Cleo makes coffee, the way the movie theater is recreated, the way one character says to another that the Cowboys won the Super Bowl because the Baltimore Colts got cocky, then sticks to that statement even when reminded that Baltimore still won. Even the sound mix feels incredibly immersive. If you can't see this in a theater or even on a TV, make sure to watch it with headphones. This is clearly a passion project for Cuarón, and it shows.

Yes, I know I haven't talked about the story yet. It's a slowly-paced slice-of-life movie, with no big showy scenes until the last half-hour. And if you're not into that, you probably won't like it as much. But while it has nowhere near the tension of Cuarón's last two films (and really, which films do?), it's still a great screenplay about domestic life, women's struggles, class issues, political turmoil, childhood, and the movies, and that's just off the top of my head. 

If the ending didn't land for you, for me it can be summed up by the inscription that appears at the end of the credits. ""Shantih Shantih Shantih"" (please tell me if I get the following explanation horribly wrong). It's a Sanskrit mantra that also appears at the end of T.S. Eliot's ""The Waste Land"", and is a prayer used to signify the end of an Upanishad. It represents peace, rest, calmness, tranquility, or bliss. There's some big changes going on, in Cléo's life, in the family, and in the world, but everything's gonna be all right. She's at peace with everything that's happened to her over the course of the year. Shantih Shantih Shantih.",a4rv1y

ebtu9it,"It's very hard as a Mexican to describe Roma. It's a love letter to Mexico, encapsulated in Mexico City. It's a letter to the country we are, from the tenderss of our abuelitas to the oppressive regime we had for 70 years and now threatens to return. The upper classes shooting guns in the woods and the lower classes living in the slums of Neza. Going for a baby crib and being a witness of incredible repression from the government.

What we are. For better or worse

But most of all, Roma is the most loving letter to women and the loneliness that can result from feeling abandoned, like Sofia said ""at the end, us women are alone"" this doesn't mean that as a gender they have gained tremendous ground but at the end of it, a lot of our moms can mirror themselves in Sofia and Cleo.  Whle Sofia was a mess her husband was bumping shoulders with his lover, while Cleo made a long trip to see Fermin, he was literally kung fu fighting.

And at the end, Cleo had the love of her kids (because they were as much as Sofias) to power through, and Cuaron ends it with ""Para Libo"" which was his Cleo.

I didn't see a better film this year. It deserves every bit of praise and I don't see how Cuaron can lose best director.",a4rv1y
ebshy5r,"The first shot of this movie is what film is all about. Cuaron managed to make a maid cleaning dog shit be the most beautiful intro to a film I've seen in a long time.

ebsnpxc,"The symbolism in this film was incredible. As a son coming from a split family, the shot of the Cleo and the family sitting silently eating ice cream after announcing what their father did, with a wedding in the backdrop, had me in tears.

ed9opc8,I wish I could have found out what this movie was about before watching it with my 4 month pregnant wife.,a4rv1y
ebrqsjr,"I think it's absolutely amazing how much this movie sounds like the real Mexico City. You can put your head out of a window at anytime during the day and you'll most certainly hear a guys selling honey, the loud-as-fuck cart selling sweet potatoes, the garbage truck with the guy who walks by with the bell, all of them were, and still are, part of this city. A day Downtown actually sounds like in the movie with all the street vendors yelling trying to get peoples attention. It really sounds like the actual Mexico City, it's amazing.


Everyone's talking about Cleo, but the scene that really got me was the scene with Sofia and the kids at the restaurant near the end.

The day my father left, my mom took me to a restaurant and, just like in the movie, she told me, with a smile on her face and a look that was a mix of fear and bravery, that from now on it would only be the two of us and that things would be better. And they were. Just because of her. I love my mom",a4rv1y

ebrdiem,"I found Roma absolutely incredible. The best filmgoing experience I’ve had this year, maybe one of the best ever. It’s so hard for me to describe what made this special to me, but I think it comes down to just how alive it was. It was a little slice of a normal, happy and sad life of Cleo, and the people around her.

There’s so much to unpack in this, but what really stood out was the acting, direction, sound design and especially cinematography. Roma represents Cuarón at his best and most confident as a storyteller, and the intimacy of Roma is almost too hard to bear.

I do want to touch on the hospital scene, though. It’s the tensest I’ve been in the cinema in a long time, and it was all done in masterfully choreographed single-angle takes that ended up lasting well beyond several minutes. When I saw the liveless little baby body, I broke down, harder than I think I’ve ever done at a film. The brutality of seeing the doctors cover the child in the background while Cleo was still in her birthgiving position was too much to handle.

When she finally makes peace with herself at the beach, saying that she didn’t really want the child, and the family all hug her, it almost hit me even more than the hospital. The fact that she realised that she has more love from the family than she could ever need, and that she loves them just as much was the perfect wrap-up of such a beautiful character arc.

Roma is a masterpiece. I can’t wait to see it again. I had to call both my parents after seeing it. It reminds you (much like Children of Men) of what a precious gift life is, and that each one matters as much as the next one. ",a4rv1y
ebt0oba,I guess its good that I saw on netflix and not in theaters cause I hate crying in public and walking around after crying.,a4rv1y
ebsqqez,"I don't know if anyone else had this experience, but it took a good 30-45 minutes for me to fall into rhythm with Roma. Saw it in theaters and by an hour in I was 100% with Cuarón. Definitely going to see it again, so I can let the movie and the longer scenes fully wash over me.

Also, as many have said, the sound design was exquisite. I thought people behind me were whispering. I turned around ready to shush them. It turned out to be the children in the movie whispering off-screen. ",a4rv1y
ebsfwsp,"What an incredible work of art. For something relatively small-scale, it feels so *big.* Focusing on this little microcosm of characters living their lives against change and heartache gives it this gravitas that I can't quite pin down. Cuaron's direction is sublime, and the actors are so good it doesn't feel like they're acting.

That beach scene near the end. So powerful and cathartic. 

**Watch this movie with people you love.** ",a4rv1y
ebrej7w,"Honestly, that birth/dead birth scene is one of the biggest gut punches I have ever seen. Shot brilliantly in this one take and with so much emotion coming out of Yalitza Aparicio.

A neorealistic masterpiece",a4rv1y
ebszww9,"This film was so immersive for being a largely plotless film. It's absolutely beautiful in the way it portrays its characters and the way the world is presented. The movie is such a complex and detailed look at the lives of domestic workers. It shows them as strong and loving individuals (which is why I think Cleo could do the one leg stand thing with her eyes closed). I didn't really cry but I shed a few scenes in the beach scene and the delivery scene. The last few scenes are so full of love and just thinking about them gets me somewhat emotional. Probably my favourite film from the past 2 years after Paddington 2. Maybe not as emotionally invested as I was with Children of Men but this is surely Cuaron's most well-made film yet.


I think Netflix did an amazing job with the film also. From advertising it as soon as you log in to the amazing subtitles (with the brackets and everything) to actually letting you watch the end credits, it's clear that they see this as something monumental and gave it respect.

Also, Fermin is a massive piece of shit.",a4rv1y
ebwdwx7,"Protest. Hospital. Beach. 3 scenes that absolutely make this movie worth the slow burn.

I think I want to focus on the character of the mother, Sofia. At first, I think the first notable scene was her telling the daughter not to eat too much. It sets the perception that we might have preconceived about a wealthy, upper-middle class woman. But then as the movie slowly unravels, you start to see her for all of her faults and her strengths. The juxtaposition of her compassion versus her failures highlights the human element and great directing. For example, as discovers her son spying on her, within 2 seconds, she immediate slaps him, and then realizes what she has done (especially in the previous scene where he witnessed his father and the mistress). It shows that not everyone's perfect. Even at the end, we learn that she's willing to take a job and sacrifices to improve her children lives. 

This movie, man. It packs so much emotions and nuances that it's worth multiple viewings to fully comprehend. I saw it with some friends on their television but I really want to see it again on the big screen.",a4rv1y

Anyway, this movie was beautiful, intimate and heartbreaking. I loved the lack of score, it really made me appreciate the sound design within the film. This may be my favourite Cuarón film to date, but that may change after I finally watch Y Tu Mamá También. ",a4rv1y
ebrzuwc,"I have never sobbed harder watching a film. It hit too close to home for me. My mom was/is essentially Cleo. Cleo’s story mirrored a lot of what I know of what my mom went through back in her home country, but the difference is, I was born.

ebyz0sp,"I'm still thinking about it. The full frontal male nude scene, absolutely no female nudity in the film....it seemed to me Cuaron did this on purpose. This, after all, is a film that is a tribute to the strength of women. Let women watch an exposed man, just like Cleo is watching him, covered, from the bed. I want to study this film. And i think this film will be studied for generations to come. Each scene, each movement of the camera, is a study in filmmaking. Why did Cuaron choose to do it this way? I am not at all a student of the craft of film making, but this movie has made me want to study the craft. Brilliant. ",a4rv1y
ebsn7pd,"Oh my, that birth scene.. ",a4rv1y
ec0zz48,"One thing I thought was fascinating was that the camera was almost totally locked down. Nearly every shot was either static or a simple pan or tilt. There was some dolly shots that were great very fluid and not distracting. For a director known for amazing camera moves, it's fascinating how Cuaron brought life through framing and blocking rather than crazy camera moves.

It reminded me a lot of one of my favorites of all time Andrei Rublev, which often has these insane scenes of violence or insanity with very little camera movement. I definitely think it was a purposeful rule for Cuaron (who was his own DP, that show off) and it creates this excellent ghostly, observational feeling to the whole thing. Just so well done.

Also how did he make a dolly shot that went OVER the ocean?! It's crazy enough to build a dolly on sand but holy shit.

**Edit:** The Hollywood Reporter just did a piece on how [the beach sequence was done.](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/how-romas-visual-effects-team-created-intense-ocean-sequence-1169264)",a4rv1y

ebuhy6b,"I saw this in Dolby Atmos and it was probably the most immersive film going experience I’ve ever had (more than 3D, HFR or VR)

What struck me was how quietly affecting this film was. I was deeply moved, but couldn’t figure out why... or at least couldn’t articulate why. 

The best way i can summarize is, this movie is a love letter to the woman who raised Cuaron. It’s sincere, respectful and honest about her life and the occasional indifference people have to her. The technical craftsmanship is staggering, but what remains prevalent is how lovingly he paints her portrait. 

I also love this quote from Nick Pinkerton of Sight and Sound:

“Roma is the sort of movie that successful pop filmmakers say they’d like to use their clout to make but almost never do.”

ebz797t,"I wonder if it's all about separation. The unity, peace and balance of the womb, when we were grand, which we lose at birth, and then struggle all our lives with the separation. Why was only Cleo, with child, able to do the yoga pose?

So many issues of separation and distance in the movie. The distant airplane. The car squeezing into the courtyard, between the trucks, fermin ritualistically forcing distance with his dance of threat. Separating books from bookcases. Class.  Brothers. 

Denying the separation is like trying to squeeze between the two trucks. Doesn't work. Better to acknowledge,  accept, deal. Love, even with the difference, the distance. That's the path to peace.",a4rv1y
ecz1hud,"Honestly, there's a lot here that would turn folks off quick; It's black and white, subtitled, long runtime, and we're not given much backstory or exposition to understand the characters. It's a slow burn, and some people might just be too bored to feel like it pays off.

With that said, I think this film is masterful in it's subtlety. The tension evoked in the Labor and Beach scenes is absolutely palpable. The subject matter really hit home for me in many ways - and my eyes watered during the more dramatic moments, which doesn't happen for me often in film. 

Unfortunately, I think a lot of people are going to find this film pretentious - but it really moved me and is definitely among my favorite films of the year. ",a4rv1y

I am really bummed there was nobody close playing this movie but thankfully I have a pretty big tv with healthy sound so I got a similar experience. we are so far into award season and well aware of the core players but Yalitza Aparicio should seriously be considered for her work here, just because she is a non professional shouldn't mean she's should be nullified. if Barkhad Abdi does for Captian Phillips then it is a crime not to recognize Yalitza's work here

As a little girl my mother would tell me stories of my grandmother in Mexico City, D.F. who worked as a maid for a wealthy doctor.. Roma to me depicts the reality of women and the social unrest that was  prevalent and continues to this day in Mexico. This story could have been my grandmother's, or even mine. The fact that there was no score allowed me to feel each scene organically without being lead to feel a certain way. The dog shit to me symbolizes the daily shit we all have to deal with. No matter  how many times you clean it up the world and life will continue to shit on you. Cleo for much of the movie maneuvers around it and cleans it up but she can't seem to keep up. Much like her station in life, she just maneuvers around her circumstances.   There's so many beautiful scenes but the beach ties everything together for me. The movie opens to the scene of water and the suds which foreshadow the ocean. As she wades in to save the children, the sea cleanses her. When she emerges clean from all the shit she just she experienced. She is finally able to verbalize that she did not want the baby to be born. She is finally able to allow herself to feel human.

ebu0kob,"If you can, absolutely watch this at the cinema. The sound design is all encompassing. At times its insanely busy and layered and dense but you can still pick out every single sound you see on screen. Then at other times, sometimes just a cut after a busy scene, it's so singular and safe and peaceful.

At the same time its visually unbelievable. Every inch of the frame is filled with things to look at. The camera is unwavering and slow and so your left to wonder through the frame. Often background interest will become the foreground interest over the course of a long shot. It always comes together in such a seamless organic way. It really feels like a peek into this fully realised world as the pan shots show us so much. 
The lighting and colouring are beautiful, it has a real texture to it. You don't quite notice how angelic the film's been untill a brief section of the film where the beauty fades in place of a much more depressing look, it gets contrasty and the blacks creep in. There's a hard cut (used throughout and really effectively) that returns us to its original look and it's such a relief.

Cleo’s daughter dying leaves her in a state of shock, but when she has to rescue her boss’s kid’s, she realizes what she has in front of her. A family that loves her. Similar to how the mom ended up kicking out her husband and selling the car, she decided to stop crying about the past and simply cut it off because her kids are what’s more important. 







They may not be Cleo’s kids but they might as well be. When she has to rescue them, she realizes that her baby should be left in the past and not shut down because she already has 4 that absolutely need her. That’s the sad but beautiful sacrifice that these workers (Cleo) go through. It might seem like she’s saying goodbye to her life goals and ambitions but she’s not. The family she works for IS her life and seeing them happy is truly what she wants because, at this point, she IS family.

ec0w08c,Maybe very obvious but I think Cuaron did an incredible job showing class separation in this movie. The scene to me that showed this most was the family around the TV watching the comedy sketch show and Cleo is the only one on the floor.  Also the scene with the taxidermy dog heads in the room during the New Years celebration. I found this so macabre and interesting and the way Cleo looks at them at the end of the scene. I'm still mulling scenes over in my head with this movie. The long tracking shots were really well done. ,a4rv1y
ec6k26j,"Truly a delightful movie. Watching this on my OLED with surround sound was outstanding. I don't think I've ever seen a movie where the sound and long, sweeping cuts immersed you to the extent where you almost forget where you are as you are watching it. Cuaran takes you on a voyage through a small slice of 1970's Mexico and fully immerses you. In some ways this reminds me a lot of Do the Right Thing by Spike Lee, in that you never see Manhattan in that movie as you are thrown in to a single neighborhood in Brooklyn. Same thing with Roma. 

I found the narrative around Cleo to be incredible. What struck me the most is that Cleo was probably the wisest person in the film, as she was forced to observe life as a silent spectator, taking in the family drama, chaos and her own personal journey with the utmost of calmness and elegance. Imagine being a spectator to the extremes of human behavior and a traumatic family dynamic without having an emotional stake in what you are seeing on a daily basis? It made her wise and loving beyond what the family could give. She was also more of a father to those kids than their actual father.

He would have been a teenager around the time this movie takes place and It was a love letter to a time and place. There is a cultural dynamic at play in the film that happens all the time in Mexico you actually do have these servant families that serve the affluent families for generations. I recognized the household dynamic from the start. It was like a time machine for my father he would point out places and streets as the film was playing. I loved it. It is a typical story scene from a different point of view but it rang true to me all the way though. The cinematography was Incredible every frame was a master piece the beautiful long takes really put you into that world and that time.  ,a4rv1y

The only thing I didn't like was the constant use of the panning shots. The times it was used to show the entire scene, like the New Year's Party, was perfect. But so much of the film was shot with the camera constantly moving. I was always being distracted by it.",a4rv1y
ebsmitp,"I can see much of my own childhood in Roma, even though the lands and cultures are literally thousands of miles apart. Sometimes it does indeed feel like Cuaron is taking you through their family photo album, and it is not always so exciting or gratifying, but almost every image tells a story and those small moments lead into an emotional payoff that is very intimate and still very much a “small” moment. I don’t think it is the masterpiece that everyone is hailing it as, but it is definitely one of the better films of this year.",a4rv1y
ebtve64,"So I just finished watching this with my dad and... this movie just tore my heart in a million pieces and sowed it back together. I'm of Mexican-descent and seeing this with my dad, who was born there in the 70's, was such a transcendant experience for both of us. I imagined him in the fields and cities just like Cleo, working hard like her, and enjoying a childhood surrounded by poverty that didn't mean you'd end up getting hurt, and yes, being in that marching band, haha. Man, the balls on Cuarón to make this love letter to Mexico is beyond my understanding. You see the perserverance of a country that is harshly misjudged in Cleo, with her selfless heart, a drive to keep everything together, and move forward to create a life she knows is best despite of her social status.  I'm looking forward to see this again. It's definetely my favorite movie of the year.",a4rv1y
ebtwchu,"If you can afford it get a sound system or at least a soundbar before watching it.

Similar to First Man for me. Didn't feel (almost) anything until the final set piece then I felt everything. The sound of the waves crashing and Cleo breaking down over the guilt of not wanting her baby who died while in labour, what an emotional rollercoaster.",a4rv1y
eby57yc,"Holy shit, that was a brutal movie. A must watch for Mexicans, though that doesn’t mean it can’t be universally enjoyed. The cinematography was top notch and the director’s ability to keep you engaged was displayed throughout the entirety of this film.  Strong contender for best movie.",a4rv1y
ec695vc,"I have to say, this film was at first equally beautiful and frustrating.

The technical production from the sound design to the cinematography all clearly stands out as some of the best in years. Really is an incredible experience from scene to scene.

Like many others, I found the plot and pacing difficult, in large part I think due to the trailer I watched on Netflix. The trailer teases a movie bubbling over in tension, leaving me anticipating a great climax. This is not a movie written around a climax. In fact, it's rather anti-climactic, which when done intentionally can still have profound emotional impact.

I also think that being a non-spanish speaking, un-educated in Mexican history and culture, I also missed out on a lot of subtleties of the movie that may have enhanced the movie tension-wise or thematically.

So I spent a large portion of the movie both in awe, but also perplexed about what exactly this movie was about. Surely it was about a Nanny in a class-conscious Mexican city during a period of social strife, but what was the message. And it didn't really become clear to me until Sofia, the mother, stumbles home drunk and tells Cleo ""No matter what they tell you, as women, we are always alone.""

And then the storytelling choices began to make sense to me. 

Spoilers ahead:

>!Initial elements that I initially found frustrating within the movie was that there were several scenes of pretty hefty emotional significance, immediately followed by life in the movie seeming to carry on as usual.!<

>!The most notable examples being Fermin's abandonment of Cleo (only briefly discussed until she decides to seek him later in the movie), and then obviously the still birth in the midst of the riots. Life just carries on for Cleo and the family seemingly without much emotional recourse.!<

>!But ironically, I think that's what makes this movie ring so true and ultimately what makes it so beautiful and poignant. The central message being that Cleo, Alfonso's nanny, is shouldered alone with the emotional responsibility and consequences of caring for a child, one who ultimately dies, and inevitably must carry on with her life anyways. Meanwhile, her baby's father carries on his ambitions without consequence, to the point of cruelty. This of course also mirrored by Sofia's husband.!<

Perhaps a greater social commentary on the unintended or unseen consequences of our cultural expectations of men and women, one you may or may not agree with, but one that is a reality for many women nonetheless.",a4rv1y
edc2xcs,"I've been thinking a lot about Roma since I've seen it, and here are some thoughts:

* The cinematography is some stellar work. Who knew that simple household chores (the opening minutes) would have my interest for so long? The camera followed Cleo with almost robotic smoothness as she picked up clothes in her masters' rooms, which made her work look more frantic than it seemed. It reminded me so much of that Super Mario Bros. level where if the edge of the screen reached Mario, it would push him off, so he had to move fast. 

*  Does the garage symbolize struggle? The Doctor maneuvered his car with careful precision while his wife, after wrecking the car in her drunken rage, bought a narrower car instead. The man brute-forced his way out of trouble, while the woman did what should have been done from the very beginning: the ingenious way of just adapting to the environment and buying a car that fits. I may be reading too much into this, but it's hilarious to me for some reason. 

* The car also symbolizes separation. The Galaxy wasn't the wife's to begin with, so selling it and buying a new car meant goodbye to that asshole of a husband. There's a bait in the scene where Mrs. Sofi was driving Cleo to the hospital. The scene begins with a close-up of the wife's hands on the steering wheel, similar to the Doctor's introduction. For a moment I though he was back, but no. The Wife's driving the Galaxy! And she lacks that spatial awareness to understand that the car won't fit between the trucks! Anyone who can drive surely cringed ( I did), because we all had those close calls in our earlier days of driving.

* **Focus**. Fermin, you lying son of a bitch. Fermin, with his nuts flying around while doing some martial arts, told Cleo that she gives him focus. When the ""Zen Master"" was teaching the martial artists in the field about focus, only Cleo did the difficult move. Numerous times in the film, a plane can be seen flying on the background. In the intro, a plane glides by as seen on the water's reflection of the sky. A plan flies behind the ""Zen Master"" as well. Then there's another plane in the ending. Cleo is as calm and steady as those planes. Although...

* ...truth be told, Cleo and Adela could have done a better job cleaning all the dog shit. Speaking of the dog, did anyone else panic when it almost escaped? That boi needs someone to walk it. ",a4rv1y
edm8bav,"Honestly, the most emotion I had with the film is the loss of the baby - I don't think the medical staff did enough -- that was really bothersome. Second, the dog shit bothered me. Talk about ""you had one job"". Fermin is a POS, the nudity was unnecessary but I guess they wanted to show what an arrogant prick he was. Cloe's backstory would be helpful. Where did she come from? How did she become a servant? She also is very timid. Overall this film didn't do anything for me. Not understanding the big hoopla. I guess I'm just not connecting. ",a4rv1y
efdhvbt,"This is filmmaking and storytelling at its best. It's an authentic, deep, striking, reflective exposition of actual life. It was filmed without the actors having a script ahead of time, so they didn't know what was coming, and in chronological order in accordance with the story which is just unheard of in the film industry. The set of the home was an actual recreation of the director's childhood home. It's beautiful act of trying to come to terms with our memories. The last movie that was similar in style and context to this was Richard Linklater's ""Boyhood"" which was also praised by a mass of people and completely lost on another mass of people who just did not get it. ",a4rv1y
efwxa4f,This movie guilted me into immediately coming home from the movie and taking my dogs out for a run.,a4rv1y
efjpu19,"So, I am a basic American who doesn't know much about other cultures, and is also a slow reader. I thought this movie was good, but I feel kind of like an idiot for not understanding a few things that are probably pretty simple. So, as I admit that I'm an idiot, any non-condescending help in understanding would be great. 

1) Why was there a tiny marching band walking down the street as the dad left? No one really reacted to it, so I wondered if this was even something really happening, or just kind of a surreal element.

2) What was with all of the airplanes?

3) Why did the mom drive the car between those two trucks at the red light? I get that she didn't care as much for the car as the dad did, but that seemed plain stupid to me. 

4) Why did Cleos friend/roommate call her a different name (I think it started with an ""M"")?

5) Whats the significance of Cleo being able to stand on one foot while no one else can at the dojo?

6) Lastly, there is a scene where the family is eating ice cream outside just after the mom tells the kids that their dad is leaving them. It's a sad things for the kids to hear, but in the background there is a super happy wedding happening while the family sits there eating ice cream all sad like. Was there an element of comedy there, or am I an asshole?",a4rv1y
ech8jhi,"A numbingly tragic and equally numb realism simmers through this film. A story so subtle it may take you to watch it twice before deciding how to feel about it. Its raw and harrowing as many here have stated but its the kind tragedy that all too many of us face or know others to face within our own lives. At no point does Roma feel forced for the drama of cinema.

The film takes the tragedies we experience, those that shudder through our lives, though the monotony of our day-to-day dictate we bear and deal with internally. A subtle type of tragedy, that as social creatures we’re almost shamed by if we dwell on for too long. The type I’ve rarely seen commentaries on in cinema. It's beautifully done.",a4rv1y

ed2vqwl,"From the [Observation Blogger](https://observationblogger.com/)

I watched Roma two days ago and I felt that as an 'arthouse' feature it was a masterpiece. I think unless you have lived in Latin America for an extended period it may be harder to become emotionally attached to the movie like some have commented. So if you aren't familiar with the social class structure and indigenous culture and their integration / segregation in Latin America, the movie may not feel so engaging as otherwise.

There was so little plot, just like in life, which may be another turn-off for the regular cinema-goer. But when things do go awry just like in life, they kind of creep up on you and then Bang! I felt very present in this movie. It can feel surreal in the moment of crises and watching the three major crises points in the movie I felt uncomfortably immersed. The cinematography, sound and the performances were impeccable. To include children as much they did in this movie and for it to feel utterly convincing is a wondrous achievement in itself.

I live in Colombia and I felt some of the themes and the general feel of the movie a bit close to home. For instance, the sounds and the images of the women doing the washing on the terraces is remarkably similar to what one might experience in much of Bogota today! Also *Roma* exuded this melancholic state which is so pervasive in Latin cinema when dealing with historical events and themes of social classes and race. Moreover, it encapsulated the cultural and interpersonal passion and vibe which is so inherent in Latin America. It got to that almost inexplicable core of what it feels like to live in a Latino family and its broader society.

*Roma* is just so unashamedly raw and in some sense too realistic for me. But I was in awe of the quality of this movie. Roma is unequivocally the best movie I saw in 2018.",a4rv1y

I remember visiting Colonia Roma during my childhood. Having a sirvienta, just like Cleo, that would love my brother and I and take care of us. She was family. The man selling camotes. The stray dogs everywhere. Brings me back. I am touched. We still have that house, my mom rents it out.",a4rv1y
ebttz6c,"The sound design was so good, it made me realize my speakers were backwards. I’ve had them hooked up to my TV like that for several years and just never noticed, but the expert placing of every noise in the movie brought it to my attention. It probably won’t get an Oscar nom for it, since that usually goes to the bigger movies, but it deserves one. Now I really regret not experiencing it in a theatre with higher quality sound. I imagine it’s an extremely immersive experience. ",a4rv1y
eby6ja5,"This is such an impressive achievement in directing that I sometimes had trouble connecting to the story - I was in awe of Cuarón’s mastery, therefore I was constantly reminded I was watching a film (a phenomenally shot film, to be clear) and wondering how did he pull this off. Roma is a spectacle but has a very subtle protagonist, who can’t verbalize or articulate her feelings - which is a different approach from the usual intimate character studies.

One of the great feats of Cuarón’s work was the direction of the cast - specially Aparicio, who has such a humanity and sincerity we can’t help but to feel for Cleo every step of the way. And his grand epic scale reminds us this is not only Cleo’s story but the portrayal of an entire country, culture and time. So even though I wasn’t always absorbed by the story, I do think is a terrific and personal film, and another masterpiece to his resumé.",a4rv1y

ecgl8ku,"I literally upgraded my Netflix subscription to watch this movie in 4K with HDR. Watching this moving on my OLED was absolute bliss.

I watched this film with my parents and what's interesting about this film is that you could theoretically show this film as a silent film and it would still work. Being the spectator to these people's lives and the trials and hardships that they are having to endure during that period of time was really interesting to view as a whole. Children of Men kind of had a similar style in that the background almost had more going on than what we were supposed to be focusing on which is I think where much of the inspiration comes from for this film. It's almost like he took the idea and concepts of filming Children of Men and applied that to a full length movie. It still centers on very specific characters but there isn't really a ""story"" per say. It's a slice of life type of experience that I haven't really seen from anything before. 

Sometimes you can get wrapped up in the dynamics of what makes a film work that an experiment like this can feel somewhat disjointed or cut off from the norms of film. We are used to seeing a story laid out, a point laid bare for us to understand and a point that we are ultimately supposed to get to, but in this there's none of that. We are watching life happening in front of us and we are experiencing it at the same time with these characters. They are us and we are them. We don't hold special sway in our world like they do in theirs. They do their thing and ultimately come together as a family just like we all do, and I think that's the point. I don't know......it was just a really graceful film that didn't hold back on showing you the raw nature of life, love, death, and family. It was indifferent in how one would feel, and for a film to do that without any reservations or without any reasoning to shy away from it compliments Cuaron as a director who is in complete control of his environment.

What tugs is what my parents kept saying during the movie as things would come up or happen that just reminded them of the neighborhood they used to live a long time ago. So many little details sprinkled across the film that made it feel so authentic to them and to myself that i couldn't help but applaud that kind of craftsmanship in telling that story.

Granted, this movie is a more personal tale, but its moral applications are more profound than anything I’ve seen in some time.

Yes, it has extraordinary cinematography and some of the shots are awe-inspiring! I do sympathize with those who may have felt the film was meandering and could not find a way to connect. I found myself saying the same thing about “moonlight” two years ago due in large part to the disjointed “Three-Act” structure the film employed.

“Roma” however struck me with a power reserved for one of the metaphorical waves depicted toward the end! Heartbreaking and nostalgic at times, Cuarón invites us not to see these characters as helpless. Rather, these characters are strong people, who have had tragic circumstances befall them. 

As with today’s issues around us, he doesn’t want you, the viewer, to keep yourself removed from their personal problems. Rather, he is opening the proverbial doors into their lives so that you can open yours, too!

“Roma” wants us to welcome each other into our hearts, if not our homes. By picking each other up when we’re down, instead of casting them away, our society can be elevated beyond the perceived limitations around us.",a4rv1y
ee0wrd6,"Watched it in 70mm at the Music Box in Chicago. I’m glad I went, not just for the visuals but moreso the sound. It took me half the film to realize there was no score. The sound was gorgeous and my shitty TV would never do it justice. That birth scene, so stressful. Cuaron is not allowed to do another birth scene after this and Children of Men. ",a4rv1y
ecy41pk,"Sorry if someone has already noted this...I did not read to the bottom of the comments. To me the theme of this movie was the strength of women, running the ""real world"" against the arrogance and evil of strong men playing in power and politics. The strong sympathetic characters were essentially all female. The main male characters were ""bad"" including the doctor-father, the boyfriend, and the family friend who hit on the mother during the party scenes (witnessed by Cleo). The men were deserters. The women stayed and prevailed. Cleo's ability to strike that pose with her eyes closed when all the males around her were failing seemed pretty intentional and symbolic. The mother's strength when revealing the truth of the father's situation to the children (she discussed it so optimistically and with a smile)...The wife's statement about women all being alone in the beginning was a foreshadowing of this theme. 

&#x200B;

Sadly, despite Cleo saving the children and seemingly being reassured of the family's love and devotion, at the end still slaves up the very long stairs with a large sack of laundry to continue her labor for them. The plane flies over as it did again and again during her earlier cleaning of the patio. Like a clock, the planes measure out the passing of time and (to me at least) seem to emphasize the lack of change...and that despite everything that happened, the class structure was immutable.

ebtw8xq,"At the end of Y Tu Mama Tambien, Luisa dives past the waves in the ocean and comes up floating in the deeper water. 

She says “la vida es como la espuma, por eso hay que darse como el mar.”   Life is like the surf/sea foam, so give yourself away like the sea. 

Basically, life is like the waves rolling in and out; experiences fizzing into and out of reality like the foam.  So, knowing that, the best thing you can do is open yourself up to all of it, to love it, to be as wide as the sea itself with your spirit.

The ocean scene in this movie seems to me to be saying just about the exact same thing.  She moves through the breaking waves and finds something deeper on the other side, love and compassion (even risking her life for the kids) and because of that, an ability to release a burden that has been eating at her during the whole movie. 

I feel like Cuarón always comes to this revelation - that the trivialities in life are unimportant and there’s something much more meaningful and spiritual going on that you need to open yourself to.  I’d even say that was the big thing in Gravity too. ",a4rv1y

I wasn’t sure what was to be of this film within the first half hour or so. One thing was certain, however, this film would give meaning to the notion of “motion picture”. Every frame was first an image, still and artful. It was as if I was looking at a series of old photographs and that memories I never had were urging them to move. Cleo seemed like an afterthought to the adults, not unnoticed, but unrecognized. She made the wheels of the family turn though the children certainly did notice. Naively, I expected more between herself and Fermin. But then maybe so did she and we therefore had something in common. Her love was quick and possibly forgettable if not for the responsibility she was left behind with. Fermin has other priorities and immediately Cleo is thrown back into isolation as marketeers parade the steps around her outside the cinema. It is all white noise. Chaos surrounds Cleo and yet she ultimately seems unfazed. Her focus appears to be elsewhere. Throughout the film, she managed to stand out amongst her colorless surroundings. Interesting, as she had to do little speaking or emoting to make this possible. Perhaps it is the viewer’s own empathy that speaks for her, directing concentration. When she goes to confront Fermin, she witnesses the training he has spoken about previously. A man guides them through an exercise to demonstrate or develop power and balance. All around Cleo, people struggle with this exercise, and yet, in a silent and nearly effortless manner she demonstrates her power. Miscarriage, riots, family separation were looming in her future. Changes were due, but she would persevere. Life goes on.",a4rv1y

ehrnirm,"Ok, I kept hearing everyone gushing about this film and decided to finally watch it. 

It was ok.  I'd say 6.5/10.

I am Mexican-American and speak fluent Spanish, so I didnt need the subtitles.   But one thing that irrationally irked the shit out of me was near the end when he asks if they have any gansitos, and the translation was ""do we have any twinkies?"" Now, twinkies are good and all, but gansitos are on a whole other level!  I felt it did not do justice to them by calling them twinkies. 

The delivery scene was tough and heartbreaking, especially since I have a one year old who spent the first month and a half of his life in the NICU.  And to see all her emotions come out on the beach scene to wrap that all up was also very touching. It was painful because she's saving the kids' lives, and confesses that she didn't really want her own kid to be born. It's such a tough situation for her to go through because of that POS boyfriend she had. 

And on the subject of the bf, the very first scenes we see him in, I didnt like his character.  The way they seem to be rushed out of their lunch because the guys say they already ate. And that last little part where he goes back to finish her coke seems like a foreshadowing of how he was willing to take everything he could from her. He didnt even take her on a proper date and opted to just have sex with her. Dude was a scumbag.

But, overall, the movie felt very slow paced, and a little overhyped. I'm glad ""Greenbook"" won, even though people seemed to be mad about it.  I went I to both films knowing nothing about either, a d ""greenbook"" was just so much more entertaining. ",a4rv1y

IF THIS FILM DOESN'T WIN ANY AWARDS FOR SOUND DESIGN/EDITING I'M GONNA BE SO PEEVED.

this film (with heaphones especially) was like ASMR to my ears. almost 8d. the beginning sequence with the water was so great.

the fading of sound in an out during tracking shots, the muffled voices/sounds when characters would walk behind objects/walls for a brief moment, the difference in echos depending on which room the setting was in, the loudness of music & street scenes to make it realistic, hearing background characters talking over main characters but not being distracting, etc.

loved cleo's story. really enjoyed sofia's as well. i didn't think i would like this movie much, but i'd almost give this a 10/10 -- heck, i might.",a4rv1y
ec5akbk,"Beautiful film. My thoughts are loose and disconnected, but here goes: 

Cleo survived attacks by most of the Earth's elements: Earth with the earthquake (in the hospital), Fire (the forest fire at the new year), and Water (saving the kids from the ocean). Was there an Air that I missed? 

I like that it gave the film an almost Biblical feel, how this one person's life is a story of survival against so many forces outside their control, but they can continue through it in quiet dignity. 

The scene in the bedroom cracked me up a little but it's interesting to see the perception shift in Cleo throughout the film. First Fermin is this unique and beautiful being - surprising both Cleo and the audience. Then he's just one of many men being trained to fight, who Cleo is superior to anyways (as seen by the tree pose scene). Then he's just a chump, the kind if sicko who would threaten to brutalize the woman he impregnated... then just a disposable cog in the government's machine.

I loved the scene where Cleo quietly masters the tree pose with no one noticing and how that parallels her strength and balance as she walked into the ocean. I kept thinking, ""oh God, she's going to be swept under"", but as she stood erect and kept moving forward, it called that scene to mind. 

I liked the detail that Fermin's shirt had ""Amor"" with a kissy couple on it when he was searching for the protestor. Why was he brandishing a gun instead of doing the martial arts moves? 

I knew the stillbirth was coming (given the foreshadowing of the baby in the incubation box with building crumbled on top of it, and the broken cup in the new year's toast)  I wasn't really expecting how painful it would be to watch. Everything else had been so underplayed up to the point of the shootout that I didn't expect that chaos or the intensity of the hospital room. The shot where you see the baby being wrapped up in the background was hard to watch. ",a4rv1y
ec8kjah,"So did Cuaron just establish himself as the superior of the three Mexican directors ? Iñarritu has never been my cup of tea, so overwrought and in your face.

It's not a bad movie by any means. Technically speaking, the cinematography and sound were great, amazing even. It was quite immersive. However, there is no story or plot here. Not much happens in this film, particularly in the first hour. All that really happens is she gets pregnant, water breaks when violence erupts during protests, she loses the baby, and she saves the kids at the beach. That is all that happens in this movie. There isn't anything that really connect these events narratively either. The film has no structure.

I also found it hard to connect with anyone, which made even the scenes where something actually happens didn't have any impact on me. Cleo was the only character who seemed to have any real development, but even her character was lacking, as nothing impacted me in this film.

Yeah, it's true that you can take almost any frame of the film and it looks like an amazing photograph. It's also true that the sound immerses you in the film. But it seems in every other area the film is lacking. I give it 6/10.",a4rv1y

Yes dramatic things happened, but there was no drive, nothing was learned, or accomplished. Im not even sure what the plot of this movie was. Things just happened. I constantly thought to myself while watching this movie ""What am I supposed to be looking forward to happen?"". There is no direction of story.

ebreqlu,"I sat in the theatre for something like 10 minutes after the credits rolled. I was a wreck. I've never cried so much at a film. It was moving, but not overly sentimental. Emotional, but not cheap. It felt impossibly human in a way that only Cuaron has mastered, from Y Tu Mama Tambien to the beautiful ending of Children of Men to now what's undoubtedly his masterpiece, Roma. I can't get the tension and catharsis of the beach scene out of my head. 

There's so much to speak about that I don't think I can even begin to touch. I want to note how incredible the long shots were in that they never called attention to themselves in the way that Birdman or, honestly, Children of Men did. In retrospect, Roma's cinematography was extremely impressive, but while watching the film I was never thinking about how technically impressive it was. It was an emotional, impressionistic experience rather than a cerebral, appreciative one, and that's what made it truly special.

ebwgoj9,"Roma reminds me of why I love film. It captures all the mundanity of life and affirms the human experience. We see how ordinary relationships of boss-employee, mother-child are portrayed with harsh, ordinary realities, yet have utterly extraordinary, even infinite, implications. There's a sense of eternal return and routine that exists throughout the movie (I love the portrayal of turning off the lights, bedtime), but the injection of love, family, and resilience brings light to everything.

It reminds me of the Raymond Carver quote:

And did you get what

you wanted from this life, even so?

I did.

And what did you want?

To call myself beloved, to feel myself

beloved on the earth.

Recently, I've caught myself feeling bored whenever I watch ""slow"" movies like Roma. This typically happens when I'm watching movies with friends, who end up on their phones. I feel dejected that I do not have excitement or entertainment from movies. But I've came to understand that movies shouldn't always have action and flashy plotlines. Movies do not have to be an escape from reality, but an affirmation and celebration of reality, even with its tragedies and injustices.",a4rv1y
ehote45,"So, most people are watching on Netflix, but how many are watching with a good surround system? The mix on this was amazing, visually it was stunning and the story was great. I pity anyone watching on a laptop. I still have only a plasma TV, no 4k or UHD yet, but those deep blacks and the overall grading just popped, even on an older TV, albeit great for its time.

My only reason for giving it 9/10 is the scene where Fermin is one of the gunmen in the shop, not too long after she had her seemingly final moment with him. Too convenient. We already knew he was an ass. I'm assuming she went into shock when she witnessed the killing and saw Fermin which caused the still birth? She still had a reason to go into shock with out him there, there's a lot going on around her that is telling her that bringing a life into this world is not a great idea. Her employer is suddenly a single mom of 4 getting stiffed on support payments. There seems to be a revolution brewing.

I had to question if an object, animal, fire, ocean wave, or jet plane was computer generated. I'm sure a lot of it was. Cuarón himself sort of admitted that some of his long shots are not pure single shots. It only bothered me when I thought about it. The emotional impact of the movie was genuine and more than made-up for the distractions and wow factor of the effects. Just one more observation: Cuaron sometimes turns his movies into ""rides."" Gravity was one long thrill ride. Iñárritu then made The Revenant to prove that he too could do incredible composite shots. So Cuarón comes back with his most personal film, that includes a ""ride"" of sorts on the day of the June 1971 massacre. We go from a long shot of chaos in the furniture store, to long shots of chaos in the hospital, to that amazing shot of the stillborn being worked on, declared dead, and wrapped up in cotton - all with Cleo, in agony, in the foreground. That was the part of Roma that felt like Gravity for me. One cannot deny the technical superiority of Mexico's three big auteurs right now (Iñárritu, Cuarón, Del Toro). Their competition and friendship has brought highbrow use of digital effects and compositing to insane new levels.",a4rv1y
ebskk76,"I've already seen this movie three times, two on cinema and just finished the third one. My first viewing was on the Cineteca Nacional in Mexico City, when Cleo was last seen going to the rooftops, everyone on the room was just speechless. 

Roma is Mexico, or at least ""a Mexico"". If this movie doesn't win all the awards it could possibly get, I'm going to be pissed. 
From the moment the opening credits scene appeared, you knew you were about to see something truly special. The moment the plane passes by to put us on context of the city was just mind blowing. From that moment alone you just say ""wow""

I believe all the movie is based on contrasts. Contrasts on the shots, the shadows, the situations, the life of all the characters. Cuarón is able to make a social critic without being pretentious. 

Seeing the Echeverría's PRI publicity, Banca Serfín, Choco Krispis, Gansitos. It's a very urban depiction, but a completely real one. That's the true value of the movie. It's incredibly well produced. The sound design is just out of this world, and I hope you all have the opportunity of seeing this movie on the big screen.

I LOVE black and white film when it’s on purpose. It was perfect for the tone of this story. Whenever I think of Mexico, I think of a cacophony of music and bright color, so the muted look and feel of the movie made me focus on the story arc and individual faces. Holy shit is Cleo gorgeous. 

This movie is a hard sell as far as recommending it to others, but I’m sure it’ll be used as a point of study as far as theme, tone, general storytelling, and visual style for years to come. The running theme of women having to fend for themselves or lean on each other is really interesting, even though it’s been explored in media countless times. I had just been broken up with via a 39-second phone call the night before, and my face was still puffy from digesting that, so I couldn’t help but think “men are trash” throughout the runtime. I ended up crying quite a bit during a certain scene, and I left the theater exhausted. My sister felt the same exhaustion, but we realized it was also from just watching Cleo go through her daily routine and constantly having to move forward. Beyond the tragedy that’s happening to her and around her, it’s draining just to witness her day-to-day life. 

I’ve been thinking about the significance of the scene where [she’s able to balance on one foot with her hands raised while everybody around her is fumbling and unable to stay upright. That whole sequence where she visits Fermin and watches the huge mass of men running through their exercises was incredible (and heartbreaking) on the big screen.] (#spoiler) 

There were a few parts that had a Napoleon Dynamite feel to it, did anybody else feel that way? I can’t really explain it. They both have a simple observational/voyeuristic style, and I just kept feeling like I was watching a really polished and serious version of Napoleon Dynamite.  

This isn’t my favorite film of the year, and it’s not my favorite Cuaron film, but it’s stunningly beautiful, brave in its patience, and is so completely immersive.  It’s really cool that it’s going to be available on Netflix for anybody and everybody to view, and I’m excited for more high caliber content, though this raises the bar SUPER high.

ebw7aqu,"I can understand why some people do not like the first half. Though I do believe that it was necessary for building up these characters and setting up what kind of environment this film is trying to portray. People of different classes, people working just like Cleo. The power dynamics between employer and maid. Where these individuals come from. The culture. It really gave much life to the film. It really did make a significant impact on the second half of the film in my opinion, especially AFTER the water scene. 

It’s the scene when they’re on the ride home and no ones saying a thing. Cleo is caressing one of the children, looking out the window and another one of the children lean on her shoulder saying, ‘I love you cleo.’ She then looks outside of the window in the moment just gazing at the landscape outside of the vehicle. It’s really beautiful and shows the kind of strength and resilience Cleo has despite her working conditions, despite what happened to her child, despite the environment she’s in with all of the political violence.

The story is about a year in the life of one soft-spoken indigenous young woman, Cleo, who is a very hard working maid to a wealthy white family of seven, and one dog, in Mexico. She is part of the family and they love her but she is also treated as an employee. The best things about the movie (and believe me there are many) is the rich art direction and scene settings. For example, in one block-long shot the family is all walking to the cinema, and the camera follows Cleo who is walking quickly ahead after one of the boys, and behind her we see inside each storefront and cafe and restaurant, with all of the detail and people and clothing of the period.

Long shots, gorgeous cinematography, great sound design (I almost thought the couple next to me were talking at points only to find that it was just the surround sound), the pure craftsmanship behind it was mind blowing.

That being said, outside of two or three moments (hospital scene, riots, and maybe the beach), I felt pretty detached from the characters or what was going on.

I know it was based on Cuaron's own nanny/hired help but Cleo was such a passive character for the entire film, that it was hard to feel any empathy for her. It just would have been nice to know something personal about her, anything really, but she just spent half the film with this blank expression.

edopbso,"So I wasn't crazy about the movie. Admittedly I'm not very into deliberately paced movies like these, but Cleo herself felt like a very passive, personality-less character who's only trait is bad shit happens to her and she perseveres through it. It doesn't bother me that the movie lacks plot but it does lack connective tissue. Like the family Cleo cares for feels absent throughout the middle of the movie and when the riots happen there's no real buildup to it. The only really message I got from this movie is that you watch a person of lesser servant sacrifice so much just so that this wealthy, high status family can have a better life. 

Everything on a technical scale from the direction to the cinematography to the memorable pan shots are great. The movie just left me feeling really cold and bored to tears. It's mostly for people who are Oscar completitionists or super fans of Cauron's work. From what Central Americans have told me however, is that it is super accurate in it's depiction of the time period.",a4rv1y

ebupk9h,"A very well made film, probably one of the best in terms of the pure film making aspects. The camera was always in the perfect position to make the most out of every scene and the sound design made the film truly immersive.

Some of the scenes come out of nowhere and are surprisingly impactful, the delivery scene especially was gripping, and the beach scene felt like a really nice natural end for what Cleo and the family had been going through.

The acting is fantastic, it really seemed like these weren't just actors pretending to be these characters but that I was watching a documentary about a real person that had been filmed.

However once the film was over I couldn't help but feel nothing, I have no desire to watch it again, I found it overly simple at times which can work but for this it just felt a bit lifeless at certain points. I thought the use of black and white worked but at no point did I think that it heightened the experience at all. A movie that comes to mind when thinking about how best to describe how I feel about this movie is The Revenant, I say this because for me both movies were incredibly well made and at no point did I dislike them but after watching them I felt like I had done absolutely nothing for 2-3 hours and I could have spent my time doing something that actually made me feel something.

I adored the cinematography, how a lot of the scenes were a single shot and didn't feel out of place at all is mighty impressive. In fact, for me, a lot of these wide angle shots and a fairly subdued protagonist adds to the feeling that this is not just the story of one but the story of many.

The two scenes at the end really grab you and don't let go.

It all feels so genuine and authentic and that it was all filmed with one vision from the beginning is so evident. I'll be really surprised if this doesn't pick up a few big awards next year. Bravo Alfonso Cuaron.",a4rv1y

Started off slow, but whatever, I’ve seen some Cohen bros films start slower but they ended up okay.

At this point I’m wondering if I put on the wrong movie. I double check and yup, this is Roma alright. An hour goes by — still nothings happened. I’m basically watching a black and white webcam following another boring persons life and I’m wondering when the fuck some witty dialogue or death on screen will happen that’ll make things interesting. Look, I get it. Slice of life film or whatever. Realism. Cool. But I go to the movies to watch some crazy shit that I otherwise wouldn’t see in my own.

I’m always interested in the music in Mexican films and one scene that stood out to me was the scene where Cléo is doing chores and listening to the radio. No Tengo Dinero by Juan Gabriel is playing. This isn’t out of the ordinary because it’s probably his most popular song and was huge around this time. However, I think it was intentionally selected because of the themes dealing with classism and love the movie explores.

ecceu81,"This is the fourth Cuaron movie I've seen after Harry Potter 3, Children of Men and Gravity. Children of Men remains my favorite because it was packed with artistic value (as is Roma) but also has a very interesting story and worldbuilding. Roma is a fantastic movie from a technical perspective, all those long takes, the beach scene with the sun in the center of the sky, the scene where Cleo simply turns off the lights in the house, the birth scene, and more looked fantastic. I've seen the movie at home on a 4k screen, so while it looked great I shouldn't comment on the sound mixing and what not. I was pleased to see some homages to previous Cuaron movies such as La Pieta, or the riot/Cleo breaking water scene similar to Children of Men, and I though it was such a nice little shot to include Marooned, which was obviously a call back to Gravity. I liked the several times the characters go to the movies, it reminded me of Cinema Paradiso, which is absolutely a movie that should be seen by those who like Roma.

Overall, I liked Children of Men better, possibly Harry Potter 3 but that does not really count in the same category as the rest of the movies I mentioned and I am slightly biased to that franchise. Between Gravity and Roma, I think it is a tie. While thematically space interests me more than 1970s Mexico I thought Cuaron created a living, breathing world.

edcr72p,"Ok, before I say anything... I *get it*, I relate deeply and understand the tone of the movie. I'm Dominican, and I watched it with my family, we all connected with the characters and felt the culture. In that regard, the film was very well made, I truly saw a telenovela girl in Cleo and the story they told.

But.... It's *boring*. It just isn't fun to watch at all, maybe cause I relate so much to the story or I've seen the archetype repeated so many times, but this was just a chore to watch.

It feels like *major* Oscar bait. Everything from the cinematography, to the trying-to-be-sad plot, screams ""Look at this artsy, indie film that's such a slice-of-life story!"".

It doesn't feel like Cuarón wanted to show Latino culture, it felt like he wanted to show *Americans* what Latino culture feels like.

",a4rv1y
ebs3cq4,"I have so many feelings about this movie. Seeing the first half hour, I was sitting in the cinema thinking ""Well, it looks like a long-ago memory was crystalized and then recreated to the point, and the cinematography is amazing, but I don't see what the hype was all about"", but then the puzzle pieces come together and create this one of a kind story, one where a story so small and intimate is told in such an epic way.

I mean, the way that Cuaron juxtaposes Cleo's life to the beating heart of Mexico during a turbulent year is just masterful, giving time to both yet respecting the scale of one another, even when they cross paths. That Corpus Christi massacre scene from the perspective of the mattress store left me with my jaw on the ground, and then the heartbreak of the hospital scene was demolishing, and when I thought I could breathe, the scene with Cleo fighting against the waves to save the child had me holding back tears.

That's because, even if Alfonso's ambitions are huge, he never forgets about Cleo. And I'm sorry to compare performances, but hey: I love Lady Gaga in A Star is Born, but she is nothing compared to Yalitza Aparicio in this. The fact that she was a teacher and this is her first acting role is unbelievable, because she just nails her character's status as someone who is emotionally a part of the family she works for, but at the same time is an employee first to the same people, for whom her full life is almost a stranger's life.

And one thing not all the reviews are not mentioning that is also worth praising is the amazing arc of Sofia, who has such a complex relationship with Cleo as her marriage is falling apart. From the desperate gestures (the scene where she pressures her kids to write emotional letters to the absent father for him to feel sorry and come back, the release of deliberately fucking with his car), to the unspoken tension with the woman who actually takes care of her children and reminds her of the expectations of her that feel like a cause of the divorce, it's just masterful, and kudos to Marina de Tavira for capturing the character. Also, that vacation dinner scene where she announces to the children that their dad is moving out and they might get a divorce is so goddamn devastating and tragicomic, down to the children crying while the waitress is trying to take advantage of the situation to shill some ice cream sales.

I only really put it together after the last scene. Cleo wanted to tell her friend everything that happened and her friend was the first and only one to basically say I can’t wait to hear it. It’s not that everyone is ignorant and selfish. That’s taken off the table because the main mother has her own problems to deal with. It’s just that everyone is going through shit and we often don’t stop to ask others what they’re dealing with. Is that pretentious? Is that far fetched? I truly don’t see it as this symbolic, complex film. I think the plane is literally a reminder of a way to leave this life behind; there are flights leaving at every shitty moment—dog shit, speaking to Fermin.

You get attached to the main characters circumstance so quickly and feel the same tenuous but loving connection to the family that she feels. I love the one POV shot where she is watching Fernin do martial arts. Things become dire for the family and Cleo and it feels relateable and organic but it does not even compare to the onslaught of stress and brutal imagery that awaits you in the final act.

Alfonso Cuarón does have some beautiful cinematography and nice long rotating shots done masterfully, and there's nothing wrong with the performances, but I just found myself unengaged for most of it. Sometimes the subtitles were difficult to read with the black and white colours blending together, but this has always been a problem for me with foreign movies having to focus on both the picture and the subtitles. Not going to dock the movie for it, just being honest.

The pacing of the movie went by pretty quickly and there's a small handful of scenes that did hit me emotionally. Like I said, I don't feel bashing it is fair and I think it boils down to just not being my type of movie rather than being weak. Truthfully, I'm not a Cinephile, mostly a ""Normie"" film person who likes watching a lot of mainstream/blockbuster movies, but I do like to give films like this a chance and time of day rather than completely ignoring they exist at all.

On the one hand, yes, cinematography was fantastic. But at the end of the day, it’s still a movie and still needs to tell a story, and I felt like Cuaron’s method of showing extended snippets of realism didn’t give me much more than a surface-level connection with the characters and what they were going through. There were big themes to be addressed like the arrogance of the patriarchy and struggles between classes, but Cleo was loved for exactly who she was which was just a servant, and she honestly deserved a better life than that. These themes basically just showed up but didn’t go beyond saying “hey this is a thing”. No real resonance there IMO.

Some things that stood out: 1) When Cleo told her boo that she was preggars and he went to go pee and get ice cream, the screen started to show a plane crashing.  I knew then that she was going to go through hell. 2) When Cleo hopped on a bus and went looking for boo, there were caskets being sold on the side of the road, including small ones for kids and even an infant. Brilliant bit of foreshadowing. Guess the ceiling falling on the incubator was, too, but that was less subtle. 3) When they were eating ice cream after the dinner where the kids found out dad was not coming back, there was a happy couple getting married in the background. On the left of the screen, you had the end of one marriage unfolding while on the right you had the beginning of a new one. Nicely done. I also like how Cleo didn't immediately eat her ice cream. I wonder if she was thinking of the night she was left alone at the theater? 4) That dog really did shit a lot. It was unbelievable. 5) I love the disdain that woman had for the Galaxy car.

What is he trying to say with this? Is it just an inside joke? Or is he saying he has no influences any more or has moved beyond all other influences? This has been said of Kubrick - after a certain point, he was totally on his own, unique path.

Like you could go up to any background character in that world, and the stories they'd tell you would be as mesmerizing as the one on screen.

In the very beginning, when they were all watching a movie together and the youngest son affectionately put his arm around Cleo, Sofia told her to ""get the doctor some milk."" It was a clear disruption of her son and servant's tender moment. After all of the trauma they experienced, the only things that changed were:

* The doctor/father left with his bookshelves
* The mother changed careers
* The servant's boyfriend left her
* They have a new family car
* They are closer together

The first and third tie in with Sofia's statement that ""we women are all alone."" Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't they all watching a movie together at the very end? As far as I'm concerned, *Roma* has quite the happy ending (once audiences accept the trauma).

egppu4l,"I had to find a place to vent this:

&#x200B;

We just watched the film tonight and it made me nauseous.

&#x200B;

I know this director is well known for his long takes but why is every single shot just a rotating camera?? It literally made me nauseous the entire film.  Every time the camera started to spin around, which was every 2 minutes, I started to get nauseous and had to look away or close my eyes.  Why was this director such a one trick pony that they couldn't do anything but spin a camera around for every goddamn shot in the 8 hour film!!!  It was just way too much of the same filming style every... single... camera spinning scene.  Ugh I'm getting sick thinking about it again.

Watching this movie looked like it was a cookie cutter ""art film""

it was black and white... check

it had unnecessary nudity... check

it had subtitles... check

it had no plot but a random series of events... check

over the top obvious symbolism (car)  ... check

common relatable tragedy done in a generic manner and very expected... check

it had random weird moments (man in costume singing at camera during a fire) ... check

it went waaaay overkill on the sound design where you heard every wave, clink, and clank at the highest mixable level usually hurting ears to oh surprise! it was trying to make you feel uncomfortable and uneasy or would just abruptly cut scene from super loud to quiet... check.

&#x200B;

I mean every aspect of this movie was just checking boxes on what an art film is supposed to look like and it was horribly shot, nauseating, and unnecessarily loud while trying to throw the fact that it was an art film in your face!

&#x200B;

Now with that being said I think the idea was well formed.  I do think the performances were beautifully depicted.  I think the window into the life of this family was well done.  I just wish the sound design was toned down significantly or maybe used in a more creative manner than just kicking the volume up to 11.  I also deeply wish this guy knew how to shoot a camera in more than ONE STYLE.  That one style literally made me feel sick and I had to keep my eyes closed for a majority of the movie so I would not vomit on my wife next to me.

&#x200B;

Holy hell though the cinematography, the sound design, and its cookie cutter art film form left me disgusted and with a deep hatred for such a cheaply made ""art film"".  I do not understand how people are calling this generic college film project a masterpiece even a little.",a4rv1y
ec372ab,"I didn’t know what I was getting myself into when the movie started, or even half way through, but by the end I knew I watched something special. 

A few scenes that stuck with me were all the parking scenes in their drive way, especially the first time the husband pulled into the driveway. There was just something so menacing about that car, it was so evil and it was so great.

The second was the earthquake and the shot of the baby with the rubble on its incubator (I think that’s what it is). It hit me so hard to see that and ultimately was foreshadowing the end. Cleo was such a beautiful character and it was a really beautiful story and movie. ",a4rv1y

More of a retelling of events, rather than a narrative movie. The pacing was slow but it worked to absorb us even if there was no major plot driving it.  Nothings spectacular stands out visually, maybe the dad scene. But I expected a little more than the slow panning from Cuaron.

The story was beautiful and worked as a memoir rather than a film, although there were no stakes and we weren’t sure of Cleo’s desires at times. In Indonesia, my Chinese-Indo relatives have a similar situation with the disconnect between them and their Native-Indo servants. 

The acting really surprised me, the actress who played Cleo has this long gaze that almost portrays longing, sadness, and wonder.

I feel like it would not work if it were a lesser established director. This is Alfonso’s love letter to his nanny; if it were a lesser known director and most people wouldn’t care.

Edited: The narrative movie part",a4rv1y
ebwn297,"Ugh, I hate to admit this, but I'm a bit underwhelmed. If considering strictly its technical merits and Cuaron's craft as a director, it's an easy 10 out of 10. It's undeniably an astounding experience when it comes to visuals and sound design. The performances are tender and organic, and Aparicio is a true natural. She's heartbreaking.

But I found myself curiously detached from the experience story and character wise. While there are many standout sequences (the fire, the earthquake, the political war in the streets, the beach sequence, even the opening credits with the plane reflected in the water. All outstanding) I just simply wasn't all too engaged in it very deeply.

I'm hoping it's because I just wasn't in the proper mood to watch it (slightly hungover, a bit distracted, and restless) because I love slow-burns. I do plan on giving a rewatch this weekend that will hopefully win me over. It's by no means a bad film, and I'd recommend it.

For real look at the nomination and you’ll see that half of the list is simply pushed for minority reasons.

ebtfzad,"I really wanted to like it. I mean, Alfonso Cuarón is a fellow Mexican. The recreation of the 70's is beautiful. The shots incredible. But there is no story, no juice, no excitement, but above all, there is no dialogue. I find that unforgivable. And, in some way, I get it, these aren't actors. If you speak Spanish, you can tell there is stiffness in the scarce dialogue, obvious one. I belive that is how he could get away with it. The performances are terrible when you pay attention to the pace of the dialogue. It is really forced, like a telenovela. He was really careful to show his mastery with the camera, to try and fool you on how poorly acted this is. I think it is a sick joke on the Academy and on all no-Spanish speakers. I feel like he tried to fool me, that every single person who said this was awesome, is a aestheticist more than a wholesome critic.

Either way, the good far outweighed any qualms I might have had with the story telling. I'd say as a protagonist, Cleo is incredible. So stoic around her employers but bursting with empathy all the same. I know I could speak to death about how well choreographed this film is in terms of extras, the confident direction and the SOUND. But I have to give props to Yalitza Aparicio for carrying this film and making me wish I could spend more time with Cleo when it ended. 

I will also say I was pleased that they allowed her that honest confession - that she didn't want that child. I can't imagine how conflicted she felt after it was a still born. 

In any case, while I enjoyed Cleo and her obvious joy in her employers children, I did feel conflicted at the possible implication that Cleo's life is basically complete because of the love of the family she serves. I'm not sure I'd read read the film that way as some others might but that may be due to my conflicting feelings on it.

I started crying and I didn't realize why - that's how well the characters were established. in this film They were relatable, real. I felt *for* them and *with* them without any effort.

&#x200B;

About the title, the first thing that came to my mind was ROMA = AMOR, backwards.

&#x200B;

Backwards love. I got this feeling in the film. Not only it was a portrait of social and power dynamics, but, throughout the film, many characters experienced this ""backwards love"" - not ""hate"", necessarily. It was lack of love. Lack of connection. Lack of perception of the people around them.

&#x200B;

The doctor and Fermín being selfish and turning their backs to the women/families their actions impacted. The bizarre absence of self-awareness of the rich people towards their employees (that fire in the woods scene... the workers were getting desperate, while the ""Richards"" were just having fun, not caring and even singing). Even Cleo saying that she didn't want her baby - showing the guilt that she felt for not wanting a child that was a product of this ""backwards love"".

&#x200B;

In the end, the cure to this ""roma"" was ""amor"". It was love that united the characters, that gave strength to Sofia and peace and acceptance to Cleo.

ebuqmc1,"I loved it on first watch (last night in theaters) but the politics of the movie has me feeling conflicted.

At the end of the day, Cleo is an employee. She is there to make sure the house is clean and the kids are taken care of. They say they love her, and I'm sure the kids do love Cleo. I'm sure Cuaron still loves the housekeeper Cleo was based on. But the movie does a good job at ignoring a lot of the class issues. The family was well-off and white, while the servants were indigenous and poor. With Fermin and the CIA-trained mercenaries, I understand the commentary about how the poor were used to murder for the interest of the rich, but that same commentary felt missing from Cleo's storyline. 

I don't believe that the mother loved Cleo, even though she said she did. She is her employer, not her friend. I understand why Cleo didn't want her child, but I don't think a servant would be satisfied working for her family. That's not a family. That's a job.

A wealthy family has their father walk out on them. Unless I missed something, those were the 2 main storylines... and meh.

To top off overdone storylines, none of the characters are developed in any way that let me care about them. We are given little to no context for anything that happens in the movie (which isn't much). Therefore, we have no idea why the characters are making the decisions that they are making.

I really wanted to like it and say it belongs in my top 10 as Gravity & Children of Men both made my list.

So many beautiful shots that would make good photographs.

As for the script, I feel Cuaron sort of rushed it or didn’t think too much about it, I was expecting a movie about a maid’s life growing with a family, seeing the children grow old, family issues, and mexico changing. Instead we get a boring protagonist with generic plot beats.  I have family who live similar lives to the family here and the maids have such fascinating, crazy eventful lives tHat I was disappointed here.

You can tell that this is a story that is very personal for Cuarón and you can see the confidence in his direction telling a story that barely even has a plot, and I feel like the symbolism of the planes represents Cuarón knows that he is portraying overall such a small story compared to what you'd expect from watching a movie.

Ws thinking about that too. I live in South America and the maid situation here is basically the same. I had many maids like Cleo growing up and most of my friends and family members had too. I loved some of my maids a lot but there was always that sense of not being the same as them ,totally reinforced by my family who would be apalled if they tried to take part of celebrations or  conversations.

My grandma had a couple of maids on her later years which became her friends and actually attended her funeral. It was kind of funny, there were mostly white , rich looking people showing very little facial  expresion,s and then there were her maids, in  indigenous attire, crying their eyes out loud, in true distress. They are just two very different worlds.

I thought parts of the movie could have been more subtle, but perhaps it was Cuaron's intention to really drive some of the themes home.

I understood pretty much most of the symbolism in the movie, but could anyone care to explain/clarify the following?:

\-The cup crashing to the floor: was that perhaps foreshadowing of the still birth to come? Was there any importance to the contents?

\-Is there any more to the tree pose that was demonstrated in front of all of the martial artists that what i think -- femininity having balance/strength in both mental and physical to withstand uncertainty(blindfold?). Dude's outfit + yoga was probably symbolic of a woman, and all the dudes were kind of snickering. i feel like there's something else i'm missing here

\-waves at the end obviously being controled by the moon (symbolic of women & cycles) -- what else did water represent?

ecfjif6,"This post is a week old and I didn't find anyone in this thread expressing how I felt watching this so I'm replying to you because you might help me understand it. 

I watched this movie because I heard Tom Merritt, someone whose opinion I think highly of, on Cordkillers say it was amazing, heavy, and one of his favorite movies of all time. Merritt tried to describe it to his co-host by stating a few facts e.g pregnant nanny, cheated on wife, Mexico city, etc but also said explaining it did t really say anything about what the movie was really about.

The description intrigued me so I decided to watch. I watched for about an hour, taking in the *facts* of the film as described to me while expecting what the movie *was really about* to come after.   In retrospect, the expectations I had going in were very misconstrued.  Until just now when I Googled who cuaron was, I didn't realize I'd ever seen one of his film (I've seen 5 apparently and really enjoyed them all). 

Having no idea of his style going in because I didn't know I knew his work, I got to the half way point expecting some major twist of the odd variety.  The random astronaut costume scenes and space film along with the government prep made me think *maybe* they were going to pull an alien twist or something else Cloverfieldesque. Another hypothesis I had was maybe time travel because the kid kept referencing seeming past lives. I'm *searching* for a big twist based on expectation of there being a thing going on behind whats just happening in the foreground.

There were about 30 minutes left before I understood, this just *is* the movie and the meaning is something I'm supposed to be seeing the whole time. Now I'm just left confused. I'm not going to say it's overrated because I don't think I even know enough of what the movie is about to rate it at all.  I feel like I just watched a game of cricket (no clue how that games played) and am trying to decide which teams doing better.

So could you help me understand what's going on here? Why is this an incredible movie?  On its face, to *me*, I don't see a there there. The cinematography seemed nice (very clear) but the shots felt slow and I found my mind wondering towards the end of some of them. The lives of the people, in retrospect, seemed to bear out basically as I would've expected. The characters where nice and the parts were well played but I didn't feel super attached to Cleo.

Currently I'm chalking it up to high art vs folk art where this is high art and I have only a folk art understanding. Folk art comes to me but high art is something I'd have to go to I.e study and learn to understand.  That leaves room for there to be greatness in the film that I simply don't understand but *would* understand if I worked at it. ",a4rv1y

However I feel like the dog shit camera shot was designed to show the husband's unrest at the home - he pretended he didn't see it when it happened event though he's super anal about his car, but later yelled at his wife about it. He's all about perception with his kids and even Cleo.",a4rv1y

My interpretation of the car had to do with power and freedom.

But also, that moment of pause he takes before exiting the car to his wife and kids, it's like that is his vehicle for freedom. A space for himself.

Camera work is mostly horrible. Just endles slow panning makes me feel it was filmed with a surveilance camera. And I kinda get it but I also don't get it.

B&W is a horrible choice for possibly the most colorful period in history. In sixties and seventies colors exploded, they were everywhere. So let's make the movie B&W, so people know it's art. It's bullshit is what it is.

The staging and set design is great. No complaints there. Sound is what it is. And then there's the acting. Such wooden and flat acting. These characters have no life in them.

I started this movie half a dozen times and haven't made it through it once. I have nothing against slow movies. Lost in translation,  Wes Anderson movies, French new wave, I'll take it all. But this is just a slow meandering mess and the least watchable movie of all the nominees.

But I do get why people think they must like it. Just like why people used to cite Citizen Kane as their favorite movie even as shlock like Casablanca is a better movie in many regards. But it is not Art, and Roma in Art and even if you don't get it you don't criticise art lest you be made to look a fool.

Plus I love Frederick Wiseman documentaries like Central Park, which are like a million hours long and the epitome of naturalism. 

But those movies all had narratives. They told stories. They didn't have an hour of long boring gratuitous shots in which absolutely nothing happened.

ehdl4py,"Yeah, I just finished watching it after the oscar buzz and loved it, for the same reasons that I loved watching GoodFellas, Children of Men, and Moonlight. I can understand why people might not enjoy the experience (and it is an experience), mostly due to the pacing and the focus on ""boring"" subject matter. It's the sort of film that quietly invites you to invest a part of yourself into, and if you do that, then you will get a crescendo of a payback by the time it's over. 

Watching it took me back to a time when I was reading short stories from Checkhov, ending in the middle of conflict yet also concluding things, while people change viscerally, gradually, and organically. I loved the complexity of the characters, especially Cleo (interesting name for a movie called Roma), who is both girlish and matriarchal, servile and saviour, innocent and irreperrably changed. 

And we get to see her in the context of 1970's Mexico City, a society that is both evolving and burning up (while ""Nero"" sings in one scene), celebratory and militaristic, kind and cruel, comical and dangerous, and ultimately in constant flux along with the people who live in it. Again, at face value that might seem boring to some, but  it's the appearance of the ""mundane"" in the midst of continuous (if unseen) danger that gives it such a great dystopian feel. Worldcups and mobs.

And then I think about the cinematography and I just fall over. It is as you said, such a beautiful film.

I think the film was very ""slice-of-life"" and so the plot points feel fairly subtle or almost non-existent, but they're there.  There was the whole storyline of the mother coming to grips with her relationship with her husband, and telling the children, and you also had the fairly significant thread of Cleo and Fermin.  This is among other things.

I've heard similar criticisms levelled against films like There Will Be Blood and The 400 Blows.

Why black and white? I don't see any reason today to still do a black and white movie. It's a stylistic choice that does nothing for me.

I think the cinematography is beautiful, and can appreciate that, but the pacing is super slow, I gave examples of both the beautiful, and the slow pacing in my review with footage from the movie. I felt that the director did these long shots for the sake of doing long shots, not because they were necessary to the story, but because he was indulging himself, and the pacing suffered because of it.

The stillbirth scene is of course emotional because I mean it's a dead baby being born then you find out she didn't even want it and is probably glad she died. Yet she is still depressed. Nothing about this movie kept me wanting to watch. I watched the clock more just begging for this chore to end. I truly do not understand the hype for this movie. Best Picture?

Considering how personal of a film this is for the director, a Mexican background or knowledge and appreciation for the culture can help generate stronger empathy for the characters in the film. 

There were so many scenes with details, phrases, sounds, objects, actions that pulled a memory out of me or reminded me of a story my parents once told me.

I really disagree with the people who try to fault the movie for it not being ""deep"" or authentic enough. When was the last time a subtitled movie had this impact? When was the last time you saw a relatively large movie like this with a language like Mixtec in it? 

What bothers me most about the Richard Brody interview is that he seems to suggest the movie should be more political, but its sheer existence is already very political, probably way too much for most audiences. I feel like the movie could only have worked for Brody if it was literally made by the maid, at which point he beings to lightly advocate for censorship. Further, so many people have had strong emotional responses to the movie, myself included. If the point of a movie isn't to present a world and stir emotions, then I don't know what else it could be. I don't really know how Brody could be satisfied: if Cleo had a bigger voice, it would simply be a different movie, and one which likely would be worse.

The same for the riot; we never see Cleo having any connection to a news source to learn what's going on in the outside world. The only time we see her watching TV or listening to the radio, it's the same entertainment the kids are consuming. Even when she goes to find Fermín training with the paramilitary group, there's no indication that she understands the broader context of the group's purpose.

It was a very stressful and heightened moment that can force all types of emotions to come out of people, particularly for Cleo. She was obviously dealing with a lot of sadness and survivor's guilt from her baby's stillborn death, which she'd bottled up since such personal and tragic issues aren't something you can easily share with others -- especially with people who are essentially your employers. 

After risking her own life to save the kids, she can't contain those pent-up emotions anymore and they spill out of her. The scene can be interpreted in a lot of ways -- I saw the water providing Cleo and the family a type of cathartic baptism to cleanse themselves and start anew after a lot of turbulence in their lives.

The long takes really allow us to drink up all the details of the wonderful set designs and get a good slice-of-life in Mexico city during the 70s.

ebuf3b8,"I think the planes both foreshadow and remember the characters (and the audience) of the father's abandonment, but also it points to the existence of other worlds out there, not only full of people that have the resources to travel by plane but also that live in other countries with different cultures.",a4rv1y

ebuuzzk,">The family was well-off and white, while the servants were indigenous and poor. With Fermin and the CIA-trained mercenaries, I understand the commentary about how the poor were used to murder for the interest of the rich, but that same commentary felt missing from Cleo's storyline.

I think it's kind of implicit, and there's no real takeaway because the reality of that dynamic is that there really is no meaningful takeaway in real life. Race isn't really part of the story, but it's always acknowledged implicitly (one of the kids asks Cleo to stop talking in her indigenous language). Moreover, it makes sure you know that there are a million Cleos in Mexico City doing the same thing that Cuaron's family did. 

As for actual social class, and the employer-employee dynamic, I think the movie actually did a really good job of trying to display the dynamic between Cleo and Sofia. I think there's clear evidence of a rivalry dynamic between the two of them, and the film never seeks to cover up either Sofia's kindness to Cleo or Sofia's fierce selfishness and cruelty. There's a really interesting element of solidarity between the two of them, as they've both been left behind by men who promised to take care of them.

As for if you think Sofia loved Cleo, I'm not sure. I think that a more tone-deaf or pleasure-seeking movie would've made Cleo stop working, but it's very clear that Cleo is still and will always be an employee of the family. It's not seeking to undermine or subvert the nature of the houskeeper, it's displaying it for what it is. 

It's politics would be kinda mediocre if it were a more overtly political film, but it's more about the characters and their relationship to those larger movements than the actual movements themselves. ",a4rv1y
ebuvc6i,"I get that, but the film isn't just about class, it's also about gender, and I think that's where Cleo's ""absorption"" into the family starts to feel more beautiful and less icky.

Same here!

I cried when Cleo was going into the water to save the children from drowning, even though I also felt a sense of empowerment because of how brave and selfless she is throughout the film but more so in that scene. Things got more intense for me when she confessed that she didn't want her baby to live, it was the first time she was able to open up about her feelings to another person, like she couldn't hold it in anymore. She was always so alone and just a background fixture around the family, even if the kids genuinely loved her, but her personal feelings were rarely truly addressed so she had to internalize all of her sadness.


Then at the end something about her walking up those stairs and suddenly the words ""Para Libo"" and then the title of the film appearing just left me in such a melancholy state, that's when the tears were freely rolling out. I just wanted to run up those stairs and hug her for a very long time.

This movie heavily drawn from Cuaron's memory. The Cuaron stand-in younger child mentions wanting to be a pilot, and that part is autobiographical. Young Alfonso initially wanted to be an astronaut/pilot. So in the same way the choice of movie (""Marooned"") wasn't a coincidence (Cuaron's early trips to the movie theater were enormously influential for him eventually becoming a director), I don't think the planes are just regular ambience. Cuaron is drawing from his memory, and as a child he dreamed of being a pilot, so those planes flying overhead were a staple of that memory (in a way that I would usually just tune out the ambient noise of a plane overhead).",a4rv1y

The water is present in almost every scene of the film, I think is because a reminiscense of Cuaron's own childhood in La Roma, at Mexico City rains a lot (daily, specially on afternoons), when is not raining people cleans houses and streets with buckets of water, families always go to the beach for holidays (the city is empty at those times), I think is a symbol and at the same time those are the memories of a childhood filled with water.",a4rv1y

It’s there where she has to go into the water and I guess is “cleansed?” By the waves? Once she comes back from the trip, she’s a completely different person when compared to before the trip.

The almost fly-on-the-wall way that Cuaron shoots most of the movie necessitates that slow pace. Since you aren't getting neat and tidy scenes with closeups and pointed dialogue that feed you the character development the way that most movies do, you just have to kind of marinate in that world for a while to get a sense of everything. For what it's worth, I didn't find it boring mostly because there's always so much going on in the frame (and even outside the frame with the incredible sound design) and it was enjoyable for me to just keep track of who everyone was and observe the details of their daily life.

The only place I could see it dropping points are in storyline, because technically it was superb.
I too believed that about an hour into it I was struggling to see the substance, but then we were hit with the riot scene, hospital scene and the beach scene. You say ""it's just the story of a woman going through tragedies"", but that can make for an incredible film. Overall it wasn't completely gripping, but can you not see the beauty in the film? All of the elements coming together?

You've also got to take in too account the intended audience. It was given a limited release because its not exactly a blockbuster film, its an art house film that is extremely personal.

&#x200B;

This story follows the life of someone we don't usually see on screen: a simple maid who is not in any way extraordinary. She doesn't go on to become Mexico's richest businesswoman, she doesn't discover she has superpowers or gets involved with the cartel and lives an adventurous life running away from the police . She is a maid and will probably die a maid. She goes through some shit and that's it. And this simplicity, to me, is a breath of fresh air amidst so many superhero movies. I'm happy to see such a simplicity depicted in such a beautiful way.

&#x200B;

Just to give you another outlook, here are some art forms about everyday, ordinary lives that are amazing.

&#x200B;

[Georges Seurat - A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte](https://www.listchallenges.com/f/lists/965402be-65dc-44df-8464-77614116fe96.jpg)

[Renoir - Luncheon of the Boating Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luncheon_of_the_Boating_Party#/media/File:Pierre-Auguste_Renoir_-_Luncheon_of_the_Boating_Party_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)

[Leo Tolstoy - The Death of Ivan Lynch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Ivan_Ilyich)

&#x200B;

None of these works above depict some out of the ordinary event. Leo Tolstoy's book is all about a man in his deathbed. These painting depict some very ordinary scenes in the authors' time. The thing about them is that they are so beautifully done that they put you in another perspective for a few moments. You see life through the eyes of a dying man or, in Roma's case, of a Mexican maid. That, to me, is art in its essence.

ec0xqvi,"Well I've not seen either of those films you mentioned. But as far as what you are saying about slice of life thing, I understand that's what they are going for but I wouldn't call those things you mention storylines. The wife may come to grips with with what happens to her marriage but it doesn't really show how she gets there. Same thing with Cleo and Fermin. It shows various events in their relationship, but it doesn't really develop it much. 

It's like if you were to look at a complicated connect the dots picture. Without the lines it is just a bunch of dots. I don't expect a film to connect all the dots for me, but this film doesn't show all the dots nor does it connect any of them, so to speak. This makes it impossible to give a satisfying picture. You need to connect at least some of the dots if you want to provide any sort of depth. This film tries to achieve depth through the cinematography by itself, but the best films use the plot as well to add depth. In fact I think it's almost impossible to achieve depth without a properly developed narrative. But this is just my opinion of course.",a4rv1y

Sometimes a slow burn can work when things properly get built upon throughout the film to lead to some kind of payoff to make your invested time worth it. But this movie felt like it plopped me right in the middle of someone's lives who I really don't know. The lack of a narrative makes it hard to get to know the characters so it made it hard for me to care. At the end of this film I still don't feel like I know any of the characters. I can maybe say their name and how they connect with Cleo, but beyond that I know nothing about them. Maybe your heritage made it easier for you to connect, but I don't have that, so I just never connected",a4rv1y
ec28mmz,"I saw the systematic oppression, but that is not a story. That is simply  just a concept. Yes the film displayed oppression, but the film didn't really have much to say about it.

All I'm asking for is a story to add some depth to the issue.",a4rv1y
ec67h6w,"A lot of people are wondering what the purpose of all this storytelling was, and are curious about the lack of payoff, and I have to pick up on what you said about ""consequences.""

I think what people are missing out on here is that there ultimately is no consequence for Fermin or for the Father. The theme in this movie, and much of Cuaron's work is that women bare the emotional burden of society by taking a backseat to men's ambition. That's the emotional theme that ties the whole peace together and gives it arc.

I'd say it's subtle, but it's not unsaid. At one point the mother even says ""we (woman) are always alone.""

Now re-examine the plot through that lens, and you have a woman, abandoned by her baby-daddy who goes on to experience a traumatic still-birth without much time for emotional closure, yet still expected to carry on without pause.

And life goes on as usual...

It's simple, it's traumatic, it's beautiful. I agree that it's perhaps not the most satisfying arc in a movie, but that is ultimately what I believe the purpose of this movie was.",a4rv1y

For example, She didn't want the baby for the whole time she carried it and then as her wish fulfilled when her baby born dead she didn't want to give the baby away and she would have wanted the baby. But it was dead as she wished. So she now regrets wishing the baby away and is depressed about hersef and missing baby. The Fermin training was about the Cleo, as after the long practice, she could do the standing balance move when everyone else struggled. The long practice helped to drive the point home. The labor starting from shock when someone just got killed next to her and guy is pointing her head with a gun seems unlikely? Seems very plausible for me... there's so much more but I don't know why am answering as this movie just was not clearly for your taste.

Critics want to make this movie a political statement when it is just about a woman who gets pregnant, gives birth, and goes back to work as if nothing happened. The relationship at the end of the movie between her and the family doesn't even change, not even with her main friend or the children. Nothing really happens. And the ""theme"" about sisterhood everybody keeps pointing out doesn't even develop or drive the movie. Everybody just states ""I'm a woman and we are together"" as if just stating the theme out loud in my face was going to blow me away. The only character that showed some dynamic in helping Cleo move forward with her life was the grandmother and all she did was try to buy a carriage on discount. Such a waste of great potential.

And I'm sorry you missed a lot of it, but she DID want that baby after all.  She could have been scared for it to be born, or didn't want it while she was pregnant - but she felt a motherly connection to her baby once she was stillborn and had regrets, did she cause this?

What I'm trying to get at is that a lot of long takes end up rather showy and become more about impressing the audience than anything.

Just a cool juxtaposition to even imagine how she would see something like that. I liked it, stuff like this gave the film a whimsical feeling that was interesting.

Currently Roma and neighbouring Condesa are known for being the epicenter of hipster subculture in the city, and rivals Polanco as the center of the city's culinary scene. Besides residential buildings, the neighbourhood streets are lined with restaurants, bars, clubs, shops, cultural centers, churches and galleries.

I dislike it because it is forcibly trying to teach me something I already know. Maybe because I am Mexican and all too familiar with the scenes.

BTW, it is not translation. For reference, use ""Y tu mamá también"", ""El laberinto del Fauno"", ""Matando Cabos"", ""La Ley de Herodes"". ""Como agua para chocolate"" is incredible (kind of funny in Spanish because the love interest of the protagonist is an Italian actor that had to be doubled in Spanish, lol). Those were fantastically acted with good dialogue, interesting stories. I bet there are more. When a movie is well acted, you can convey that in whatever language. 

My biggest problem with Roma is the hype. The sentimentalism without actual resolution. Doesn't it bother you she remains a maid and that is all she is ever gonna be? It is a swing at the Mexican middle class and a self-defeating one. In my family, we have had one cleaning lady throughout my life (not a live-in one, that is for the pseudo-rich). She has helped my family in ways I cannot even explain, my family, in turn, helped her build her house, put her kids through school, sent her to take some nursing studies, she is insured and my mom bought a sewing machine for her when she wanted to start sewing as means to earn more money (she goes to our house 4 times a week for 3 hours). We are better because she is there and she is better because we are there. We love her beyond words (when she had it rough my mom and I talked to her for hours on end, day after day, like the friend she is) she returns that love. It has been a healthy employer/employee relationship. This portrayal is patronizing trying to be sold as ""a love letter""... I say to Cuaron: f\*\*\* off, we are not all like you and your family.

edglt96,"> the dark-skinned servants who spoke the ""lower-class"" Mexican dialect


It's not a Mexican dialect.  It's Mixteco language, completely different from the Spanish language that most mexicans have as mother tounge. In fact Mixteco is older than Spanish.",a4rv1y

ed8l202,"Coming from a middle class Chinese family who emigrated to the US to a lower middle class status, this movie speaks nothing to me. I didn't have or know anyone with a servant, pregnancy out of wetlock is very looked down upon in the culture, abandoning family is also very looked down upon in the culture (formal divorces is not the same), never been in a violent student protest before, and my parents actually parented properly and watched me when I was at the beach playing.

I have never seen kite runner, but I love slices of life movies so I might check it out. Lost in Translation is one of my favorite films. I also enjoyed Lady Bird. I couldn't exactly relate to Ladybird either, but at least there is a narrative there that made me care about the characters. After 2 hours I still didn't care about Cleo. She showed almost no emotion, subtle or not, except for the birth and beach scenes but the movie is already over by that time. She was just...kind of there. Just not an interesting character in my perspective.  I cared more about the fact that the dog shits way too much and that no one is picking it up making me think she is a terrible housekeeper.",a4rv1y

Especially Fermin calling Cleo a servant with such disdain, as if it were a slur. It's something I'd love to see touched on more directly in another film by Cuarón. 

It's really distressing to hear that people have made such vulgar comments about Aparicio. I thought she was so striking and it's really unfortunate that others can't see past their narrow views of beauty. I can't wait to see her during the awards circuit. I'm sure this will win many. ",a4rv1y

ebybmeq,"Nail on the head. Political takeaways aren't a priority for the film, yet I don't think it ignores a lot of details its main topics bring up -- I think it's a very observed and nuanced movie that isn't meant for easy didacticism. 

Sofia and Cleo (and the grandma) are definitely meant to mirror and contrast each other in various ways as matriarchs of the family. Sofia may have greater authority than Cleo as her employer, but her privileged socioeconomic status has made her complacent to a fault. Conversely, Cleo is stronger and more resilient because of her poor upbringing.

I don't know enough about '70s Mexican society and politics or the specific protest it portrayed, so can't really speak on those. But I think Fermin was an interesting character who mirrors a lot of people driven to violent political causes -- his ultra-seriousness comes from a life of hardship, and his passion/dedication to training that he claims to have given him guidance in life nevertheless fails to alleviate other faults like his bitterness and cruelty. He's a naive, idealistic warrior seeking war for a messy/contradictory notion of purpose.",a4rv1y

I wouldn’t care at all, but this movie is getting such high praise and I just don’t get it. I understand that the technical aspects of the movie are amazing, and I’m not going to deny any of that. The scenes and settings are wonderfully done. But the story takes such a back seat to the rest of it and I’m wondering if it’s a giant troll job.",a4rv1y

I predict that ten years from now this film will serve as fodder in discussions about the affects of sexism in mid-20th century Mexico. The one thing that was absolutely concrete about this film is the role sexism, subtle or not, played in the life of Cleo.

So many American movies use the dead dog thing as a tear jerker. He didn't and that became a red herring. We were looking but it never came. I think the dog shit also represented how messy life is and can be. You can't fix everything and we're constantly wondering if and when someone is going to step in the shit.

 I like the concept of film as an empathy machine.  The US box offices are telling in this respect. The blockbusters would suggest audiences like seeing someone already like themselves in appearance but in a super-sized way e.g. Tom cruise action is a big hit with white male audiences. It must be *easier* to make a character who is someone who you already feel close to in someway.

An anecdote: a few years ago there was a commotion in my home town via social media because a lady photographed a small blue-eyed blonde girl selling candies in the street and everyone was convinced that she must have been stolen from a ""good family"" because the idea of a poor white is abysmal in our society.

I'm a software engineer making consultancy for US-based startups and I make good money, but I still get sneered out on restaurants, apple stores,  etc. because I'm brown and short and look like most poor people look.

Like I said in another post, there were some really amazing sequences (such as the revolution/labor scene -- *though not the gratuitous, pornographically depicted stillborn baby* \-- as well as the beach scene). And I think that if you condensed the first hour into a few minutes and trimmed the rest, it could have been a classic short film. Maybe 20 minutes of really, really great stuff.

Distant planes, squeezing into a garage or between two trucks, resenting, defying, or accepting these constraints. Separation between worker and boss, between siblings, between spouses. How do you deal with the separation, the distance? What's the resolution? Maybe acceptance. Not fearing what's distant, different, outside of what you know. Love, despite the distance.

As for me, First Reformed, Eighth Grade and You Were Never Really Here should of be in that spot over Roma or even Bohemian Rhapsody or Black Panther for that matter. All three movies I mentioned had better performances and a driving plot that kept me wanting more. Their characters had substance and I felt connections to them. I cared about what happened to them. Roma is a perfect example of the academy jerking off a movie because of the photographic black and white shots and artsy nuance. There was no substance. It was empty.

We know some things that happened to them, but I require a bit more character development to connect with these characters on a level that gets me to care. The film just feels like it's missing a few pieces. The relationship between Cleo and Fermin, I feel, would have been more interesting if they developed the relationship more and perhaps do something more with how Fermin had the gun during the protest scene.

I think you should remember that movie preferences are subjective and that people can like different things.  Your opinion isn't canon into what makes or breaks a good movie.  I believe Roma especially is an interesting film in todays climate because of the past 30 years, movies have gotten much quicker paced, more dramatic, higher production value and scale, and Roma doesn't care about any of that.  Roma slows down and lets the scenes and dialogue breath. It lets you think about how these emotions and feelings parallel your own life, and how you can relate to this character, even though the circumstances, setting, time, aren't even close to similar.

The movie is like hey come watch this intimate story of a servant girl in 1970s Mexico and you sit down to watch it in good faith and in the characters life this is probably the most crucial scene in her life right here. She’s pregnant vulnerable doesn’t know what she’s going to do. She tells this guy he seems to be comforting then suddenly leaves and we experience the tension of is he coming back or not with her. That’s huge in the context of this story that was always going to be a personal movie and never lied to you or pretended to be anything more immediately exciting. I’m not saying you lack empathy but you definitley didn’t watch the movie in good faith if you mischaracterize this scene as nothing happening on screen. 

As for empathizing with people who found it boring I don’t mind that people are used to much more dynamic slick edited movies. I think it’s a cool thing this movie did trying to really put people in the headspace of this woman’s world, seeing stuff from her perspective, some people went for the ride and some people seem to have held back and judged the movie from a “so this is art huh?” Perspective where they didn’t get into it.

ehzfet7,"Oscar check boxes meaning the film consciously inserts anti-patriarchal, and anti-oppressor narratives instead of telling an organic story, so it becomes goal-driven morality message rather than a genuine work of art.  The characters don't take a life of their own, and instead are superficial ideological stand-ins for a moral message.

So if you understand that the movie had the anti-patriarchy goal going in, then >!you know as soon Fermin and Cleo copulate, that she was going to become pregnant, and he was going to bounce.  I called that immediately.  I had no idea the extent to which the movie was going to paint Fermin so villainously.  Not only does he bail on the news of her pregnancy, but when she tracks him down, he threatens to physically harm her and the unborn child.  And if that wasn't enough, he joins the CIA backed paramilitary group that violently attacks the student / pro Che Guevaran demonstration, and holds her at gun-point, which then leads to her to stress out and have a premature birth, resulting in the baby's death.  I knew there was no way that the baby was being born even when the pregnancy was first discussed, because that wouldn't be a symbol of empowerment for Cleo, bringing in an offspring of such a ""monster"" - and just to reinforce that message of empowerment even further, she stated at the end of the film she didn't want the baby anyway, so she performs a sort of subconscious, or conscious mental abortion, which means that instead of being the victim of Fermi, she willingly mentally aborted the child and took back the child.   So just what I've described ticks 4 boxes:  You have sympathy for the Che Guevaran demonstrators getting attacked , which is an anti-Oppressor narrative, the attackers were CIA backed, so you have another anti-Oppressor narrative, you have a symbol of both the male and American-backed patriarchy in Fermin, you have an indirect but ""willed"" abortion, and that's from Fermin ALONE.  Fermin isn't a complex character - he's just a superficial bad guy stand in for an ideological message.!<

&#x200B;

>!You have the father that I knew was going to end up leaving the family as soon that first scene of him with the family is shown, and he was aloof and distant.  Not only does he leave the family and all of his children for selfish reasons, but he lies to his family, we see him cheating on his wife with a younger woman, we see him being a prick at the hospital when he was caught in a lie about seeing Cleo later, and then to top it off, in the final scene, he removes the bookcases from the house, but leaves the books, alluding to the fact that he's not an intellectual, he's a bit of a con, and that the wife was REAL intellectual in the house the whole time.  Again, he's not a complex character with his version of events - just another superficial bad guy. !<

&#x200B;

>!Other things include the visit to the rich, white Scandinavian home, with all of the mounted game heads, and all of them just inebriated, almost bored, shooting guns with little regard for their safety... one guy hits on the wife, and she of course turns down his advances.  When the fire breaks out in the forest, all of the adult white people just laugh, and just watch the fire with amusement, while the kids and the Mexicans work diligently to put the fire out. !<

I got all of that from one viewing without even necessarily looking for these things - these ideologically inserted threads sewn into the movie were just so blatant it was hard to ignore.

Please understand that I'm not opposed to many of the moral messages in the film (I'm opposed to some), I'm just opposed to didactic, inorganic, propagandistic type narratives.  It's like watching a Capra pro-American film...  there's no story there - it's just preaching.

Also again where are you coming from?

ed8zht5,"I don't agree with that last statement. Neither classes dealt with the same situation. Different struggles, yes, but not similar. I didn't really sense the class separation either. You just see a woman doing her job. Cleo outside of work is just a normal person who goes on bad dates and watches movies. You don't really see how the Mom is outside of home life besides the scene where you comes home drunk. You see one new years scene where the classes have different parties. Neither is portrayed differently as both sides have their own fun and both looks enjoyable. 

I have a feeling it is cultural and I simply cannot relate. Unfortunately if the movie is based so much on reliability to one thing, I don't think it is a good movie. Technically, the movie is perfect. As a story telling medium, it didn't tell me anything about the characters more than what I already knew from the first 3 minutes of the film. 

Comparing this movie to Eighth Grade, which is also a slower moving slice of life film that I also cannot relate to because I am in a different generation. In Eigth Grade you see how Kayla progresses as a person through the movie. In Roma, Cleo, at the end of the day, is still Cleo. Nothing more nothing less. She doesn't grow as a person.

But maybe we're not really in dispute here. You're simply saying that Netflix is not specialized for highbrow content like Filmstruck is.

edtnpil,"All that foreshadowing was suitably obvious for the pregnancy arc, what is arguably the main 'plot' beyond just 'here's a chunk of this person's life, look at all the pretty camerawork and painstakingly recreated bit of culture and history'.

I was a bit disappointed that there were things that felt like foreshadowing that gave minimal payoff. 

Like, the youngest son woulds tell those creepy past-life stories about 'when I was old', there's a slight juxtaposition of the kid telling a 'I was a sailor in a storm and drowned' story as the other siblings are actually in danger of drowning but that's it.

Or the clues that the dad's run out on them, lots of 'ooh, what's he up to' hints, but that just ends with the dad officially moves out, nothing more exciting like he kicks them out of the house in retaliation for the wife selling the Galaxy or anything, just 'oh he left, took his stuff, told the kids, they took it fairly well, we'll carry on without him somehow.'

Or Fermin, lots of 'watch out for this guy' foreshadowing, being all edgy, gets Cleo pregnant, predictably yet surprisingly immediately ditches her when she tells him, hints that he'll be involved in the civil unrest undertones, payoff is: yep, he was, he's like 3 different kinds of asshole. Yay?

Even the dog poop. The big beautiful opening shot of the movie is all about Cleo cleaning up after the dog, and it keeps coming back as the focus of various scenes either visually or in dialogue, but the payoff is: Cleo just sucks at keeping up with cleaning up after the dog. Or hates it. So poop everywhere. No tie-in to later scenes, just a thing that happens.

I think that, in addition to being good technically, the movie does a good job of presenting the environment of 1970s Mexico and making you immersed in the setting. It's not very predictable and does a good job of balancing the mundane things with more important things. Two main characters give good performances and the movie touches on various themes such as class, politics, and growing up, through the characters' experiences. 

I don't think that some of those films you listed meet the definition of a slice of life movie. I don't think that Black Swan and Life of Pi, for example, are slice of life movies.

As for the characters not experience the same things, both women were abandoned by men, both are raising children alone, neither knows where to go or how to cope and isn't satisfied with the life they have. Even though they live together and have similar struggles they don't have the societal ability to interact on an emotional level.

And in Black and White, of course, to give it some of that ""artistic and poetic"" movie touch. The perfect excuse for cinema critics and snobs to ""show off"" their cinema knowledge and put it above any other movie... ""It can't fail"" said Cuarón to Netflix executives. Oh, the arrogance.

Add all those millions invested in lobbying the movie and they were celebrating and being cocky months before the Oscars... ""and the Oscar goes to... NOT ROMA""... WHAM!!! Roma, Cuarón and Netflix get denied. Love it! By the way, the cinematography was in collaboration with Galo Olivares, who didn't even get mentioned by Cuarón (those close to the project say it was practically all Olivares, do a Google search of ""Roma Galo Olivares""). Wouldn't be the first time Cuarón decides to get all the credit for something he barely did/collaborated on... he also took credit for editing Gravity and Roma as well when he didn't even touch the Avid workstation in both cases. The entire backstory to how Roma was custom made to ""win"" Best Picture and the dictatorship of Cuarón to get all the credits is fascinating (there's a reason Cuarón is refered within the movie industry as a wolf in sheep's clothing), and the failure to win BP after so much money and arrogance is very satisfying... much to the chagrin of all those that got fooled by the hype of the movie.",a4rv1y

I didn't understand why she was so accepting of the many indignities of her job, namely the way she was treated by the mother and, to some extent, the children, and why she allowed herself to be embraced by them.

We get a hint of her backstory when the other maid references her mother's farm. I'm not sure if there are other hints.

Again, I absolutely love the idea of this incredibly small story set inside the sweeping vista of Mexico in the early 70s, but I didn't understand what was going on in the streets or what was going on with Cleo. I'm not demanding she have some ""Hollywood"" goal of breaking away from the family and making a life for herself. That's unrealistic for a person like her. 

But she was this quiet person put in a terrible position - pregnant with an unwanted child that would jeopardize her job. Again, though, Cuaron gets rid of half the stakes when the mother says she has no problem with Cleo being pregnant. So now it's just that Cleo will have to take care of a baby on her own. This sucks, but its doable, especially in such a nice house and with wealthy benefactors.

I would have liked to see her fight against Fermin more, fight for what she wanted from him.

One of the most cited scenes from the movie - the ocean sequence at the end - is so strong because we know what Cleo wants (to save the people she loves) and we understand the stakes (death). We're on the edge of our seat. She's completely active, for only maybe the second time in the movie (after her search for Fermin). There's no other point in the movie where the goal and stakes are so clear.

When she goes looking for Fermin, Cuaron again subtly takes the air out of the sequence by focusing on the guy from TV doing his balancing trick. What does this have to do with Cleo's story? Is this detail of the story actually relevant or important? Then, when Cleo confronts Fermin, we're excited. We know what Fermin has done. We know he could hurt her. We know what she wants and needs. And then, in an instant, he dismisses her and walks off. It's like 12-15 minutes of buildup, deflated somewhat by the sequence with the TV guy, and then immediately brushed aside by Fermin's choice. Cleo makes no choice, does nothing.

I wanted to like this movie. It felt like it could be Bresson meets Cuaron. But this is just the most passive character I've ever seen, in a very low stakes story, set in a conflict that's never elaborated upon (except maybe in some TV or radio excerpts?).",a4rv1y

I live in Mexico City and I can say without a shadow of a doubt her being indigenous is a huge part as to why people liked the movie here (or hated it).

However, to me, her race and even her status as indigenous helps her immensely as a rather mediocre actress who is essentially playing herself. I think it's disingenuous to pretend like it's not playing some part.

Also, the setting is presented from the least interesting character. A housemaid with no culture, education or drive to do much more than overlook her duties of cleaning up dog excrement.

( As a person who lived and worked for a year and a half I understand. ) Again, if you take away the visual art style and simple look at the narrative what are you left with? I’ll tell you what... it’s called life. You see what‘s happening here is simple,  “Alfonso Cuarón” is aware of what is the hot topic of our world and wants a piece of that pie and what better way of accomplishing that by making  her a poor, uneducated, indigenous simpleton and saying “Hey world don’t forget about us here too... We too should have Indigenous guilt, ( like the Democratic trying to push white guilt on American ) down with the spanish decent!” In simple terms slaves of spanish culture reaching from Mexico all the way down to Chile. Why do this? Simple, because you are manipulated to feel emotionally attached. They show that women are the victims and men are the monsters while the boy is being pampered throughout the movie. If we keep allowing work like this to be past as acceptable for Oscar nominations then I’m sorry i have no hope for future generation who have to relay on shit covered in a bow. 

So you see I’m not the only one who sees it for what it is, and maybe you @d0ubl should stop saying I’m projecting myself and open your mind to the fact that maybe you’re forced to liking it because you’re emotionally attached and that’s okay. You can love the movie all you want and maybe to you it is a masterpiece but let’s be honest this simple isn’t a inspirational movie that should be selected for reference as a best picture. 

You want a movie that has all same concept... Watch “Green Book” same setting 1970s same issue racial discrimination, only this time its deeper and richer with a white man working as a drive/bodyguard for a black musician. Without ruining the move for you if you haven’t seen it. But that right there alone sets the tone up for an interesting capture and strong message. The movie beautiful capture the time and you see just how much American ( USA ) has grown ( Not perfect but certainly not a whole lot better for all walks of life. ) This move should win the Best picture of not Green Book, the. A Star is Born.

Now for your last comment, not sure how you go off saying Life of Pi isn’t slice of life simple because his day in and out was on a boat but okay sure fine let’s agree to disagree and say it’s a survival movie 🙄. But Black Swan, hmm nope, that is a slice of life movie because it depicts the life of a everyday geisha.

I didn't think too much of the main character's native heritage, and IIRC the movie never has an explicitly racist scene of ""you're native, you're worse than the lighter skinned people"". Also the movie was semi-autobiographical, as Cuaron grew up with a single mother and a maid in Mexico City. He simply wanted to tell his life story like other writer/directors before him. ",a4rv1y

ebrukyc,"Maybe it's going to get more attention, but in that case it'll just mean the movie is more mainstream than we thought it would be.

If you agree that most Netflix users are mostly interested in mainstream movies, then that makes it a mainstream demographic by definition. I'm not sure what there is to argue exactly. Sure there is a small subset of that demographic that has different tastes, but that doesn't change what the average tastes of the whole demographic are.

ec89va6,">I bet poor Libo cried of shame, to see herself portrayed in such a helpless manner, so one-dimensional and hopeless.

You really believe that? When she went head on against crashing waves to rescue the children she loves. When she displayed a great inner strength at the martial arts training that only she and Profesor Zovek possessed while everyone else struggled to find balance. That’s a pretty bold to assume Libo “cried of shame” when Cleo is clearly shown to be a strong-willed person in the face of adversity despite what life throws at her. Why would Cuarón let her be portrayed as “helpless” when the film is honoring Libo and the strong women that helped raise him? That makes no sense.

edn6ol7,"Yeah, Roma was made especially for crowd entertainment, shot completely in black and white in 2018, spoken almost completely in Latin American Spanish and Mixtec, and completely devoid of much action and in your face dialogue, in order to understand every character's development (there is plenty in it) you need to actually read between the lines

Cleo's persistence in her tenderness despite the numerous heartbreaks she suffers along the film make her inspiring, Sofi's decision to carry an entire family of 4 people despite her husband's cynism make her hardworking, Fermín's abandonment of his loved one in order to serve the government in a brutal way makes him not just cruel, but a lonely character as well

I could describe so much more about everyone, yet everything you saw was just naked martial arts, stillborns and dog shit, yet you claim to love all of those directors and call Cuarón a crowpleaser, what a motherfucking dumbass asshole",a4rv1y
ei70ftx,"Reposted my original reply for your convenience.  Please read in its entirety so you can understand.

“Oscar check boxes meaning the film consciously inserts anti-patriarchal, and anti-oppressor narratives instead of telling an organic story, so it becomes goal-driven morality message rather than a genuine work of art.  The characters don't take a life of their own, and instead are superficial ideological stand-ins for a moral message.

So if you understand that the movie had the anti-patriarchy goal going in, then you know as soon Fermin and Cleo copulate, that she was going to become pregnant, and he was going to bounce.  I called that immediately.  I had no idea the extent to which the movie was going to paint Fermin so villainously.  Not only does he bail on the news of her pregnancy, but when she tracks him down, he threatens to physically harm her and the unborn child.  And if that wasn't enough, he joins the CIA backed paramilitary group that violently attacks the student / pro Che Guevaran demonstration, and holds her at gun-point, which then leads to her to stress out and have a premature birth, resulting in the baby's death.  I knew there was no way that the baby was being born even when the pregnancy was first discussed, because that wouldn't be a symbol of empowerment for Cleo, bringing in an offspring of such a ""monster"" - and just to reinforce that message of empowerment even further, she stated at the end of the film she didn't want the baby anyway, so she performs a sort of subconscious, or conscious mental abortion, which means that instead of being the victim of Fermi, she willingly mentally aborted the child and took back the child.   So just what I've described ticks 4 boxes:  You have sympathy for the Che Guevaran demonstrators getting attacked , which is an anti-Oppressor narrative, the attackers were CIA backed, so you have another anti-Oppressor narrative, you have a symbol of both the male and American-backed patriarchy in Fermin, you have an indirect but ""willed"" abortion, and that's from Fermin ALONE.  Fermin isn't a complex character - he's just a superficial bad guy stand in for an ideological message.

You have the father that I knew was going to end up leaving the family as soon that first scene of him with the family is shown, and he was aloof and distant.  Not only does he leave the family and all of his children for selfish reasons, but he lies to his family, we see him cheating on his wife with a younger woman, we see him being a prick at the hospital when he was caught in a lie about seeing Cleo later, and then to top it off, in the final scene, he removes the bookcases from the house, but leaves the books, alluding to the fact that he's not an intellectual, he's a bit of a con, and that the wife was REAL intellectual in the house the whole time.  Again, he's not a complex character with his version of events - just another superficial bad guy.

Other things include the visit to the rich, white Scandinavian home, with all of the mounted game heads, and all of them just inebriated, almost bored, shooting guns with little regard for their safety... one guy hits on the wife, and she of course turns down his advances.  When the fire breaks out in the forest, all of the adult white people just laugh, and just watch the fire with amusement, while the kids and the Mexicans work diligently to put the fire out.

I got all of that from one viewing without even necessarily looking for these things - these ideologically inserted threads sewn into the movie were just so blatant it was hard to ignore.  

Please understand that I'm not opposed to many of the moral messages in the film (I'm opposed to some), I'm just opposed to didactic, inorganic, propagandistic type narratives.  It's like watching a Capra pro-American film...  there's no story there - it's just preaching.”",a4rv1y

You see, don’t you ask yourself these questions? You could of keep everything the same but instead move the focus and perspective to the boys eye or of young mans eyes and I bet you it would of been more interesting. And yes there was I believe two scenes in the movie that showed racism, the one that comes to mind is where they visit the Americans house and the maid of the house they were visiting on New Year’s Eve/day said said something along the lines “what you think of yourself white” something like that.

Most people aren't into movies like Roma, you're absolutely right about that, but Netflix's business model isn't like TV networks in the sense that they're solely interested in appealing to the broadest possible audience. They're trying to provide a service where there's ""something for everyone"", including people who enjoy black-and-white subtitled Mexican films by acclaimed directors. You get more subscribers that way, which gets them more money. They want a diverse catalogue.

I don't like sanctified people. It bugs me because it is not a faithful portrayal on human nature. No one is that selfless and if she is, there is no self care. Survival is hard wired into all of us and she does not seem very committed to it. Doesn't it make you a little uncomfortable in an unhealthy way. It does to me. It makes me wanna cry to see our mixtecos so poorly represented. When I know they are proud, beautiful, industrious, crafty, even a little conniving (I say that without malice). This movie is deceiving in so many ways and it plays to the misplaced empathies of the first world. I am so proud of Mexico for so many things that I don't see here.

Furthermore, technically speaking, beautifully shot with nothing more. The acting is appalling. Hear me out. You can tell in Spanish by the cadence of the dialogue when someone believes what they are saying. None of them do. It makes it so difficult to remain present, it is painful to listen to. Add the never ending spinning camera and the close ups and the nostalgic references and it becomes heavy and uninteresting. Because there are movies that are heavy but keep you hooked.

Because his maid was indigenous, and as he grew up, he probably realized how little he really knew about her. His family always putting her and her own life in the background. They feel love for her, but they also place her beneath them as the help. It’s a complex relationship. 
Cuarón dedicates this movie to his maid. The little boy who loved his maid grew up and realized how he, unknowingly, treated her as less. This movie was his attempt to center her and her story, as amends for what he couldn’t do as a child.",a4rv1y

Soap Operas center almost entirely on romance, they're horrendously predictable and their dialogue is very basic, as their objective itself isn't to portray reality in a relatable way, but to present a fantasy for everyone to live in, perfect romance, perfect husband, perfect life in the end

Roma didn't center itself on romance, sure romance was in there, but not as a focus for the entire way, rather it was a medium to express the hardships that Cleo overcomes in her journey throught life, so was the stillborn, the movie doesn't center as much in Sofìa's romance with Antonio for too long, as its more about Sofía's way of carrying a whole family, Roma's characters arcs are more centered on themselves, not the people they're with
