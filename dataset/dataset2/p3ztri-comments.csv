h8vdspa,That scene between Ruby and Frank in the back of their truck as he 'listens' to her sing - what a brilliantly acted scene.,p3ztri
h8v6to4,"Excellent heartwarming movie, I liked when they flipped the perspective to the deaf members of the family to show their side too.",p3ztri
h8vdaih,"I cried for the last 15 minutes of this movie. It was incredibly predictable and I knew what was coming, yet it still hit me like a truck.",p3ztri
h8vvpz9,Predictability doesn‚Äôt even matter when a film is so well acted and directed. The sentimentality was laid on thick but I didn‚Äôt mind. What a sweet and wholesome movie that will make your heart happy.,p3ztri
h8xxmhj,"As a CODA myself, I really loved the movie. That ensemble cast is hilarious together, and the film overall has some insanely specific details that feel pulled straight from my own life. Plus, to see real Deaf actors play Deaf characters is so damn refreshing.

h99xzsk,"Interview with Emilia Jones ([https://www.glamour.com/story/meet-emilia-jones-coda-star](https://www.glamour.com/story/meet-emilia-jones-coda-star)):

>**What was your favorite scene to film?**  
>  
>I loved the quarry scenes. I had never really jumped off rocks like that before, and I‚Äôm a daredevil, so I loved that. But my favorite scene to film was with Troy on the back of the pickup truck. It was the last scene of the day, and we were trying to figure the best way for Troy to feel my \[singing\] vibrations. We were working it out and Troy broke away, looked at me, and said, ‚ÄúI would give anything to be able to hear you sing right now.‚Äù We were very close because Troy was missing his daughter, and I was missing my dad, so we had this special bond. He folded me into one of his hugs and it really touched me.

Aaaand I'm crying again...",p3ztri
h8xz8c8,"2/10 hallmark channel story, yet somehow 9/10 film. 

I love it when films surprise me like that, it's a movie with heart and purpose and it's enough to make it worth the watch.",p3ztri
h8zrbom,"As a fellow coda, I enjoyed the movie immensely.  My deaf parents as well, even though pops was a bit bothered by the heavy sexual innuendos during the first part of the movie (OG religious type fella lol). 

The scene with the daughter singing to her dad had me bawling like baby. 

I understand the controversy that is rumbling throughout the deaf/coda community of not casting a true coda. However, we should appreciate the art direction of this film.  Very moving! Emilia Jones definitely played the role well, at least in my POV!

ü§ü",p3ztri
h8vmwts,"A very sweet movie. Would never have thought about the challenges facing CODAs, the burden of having your family become so dependent on you and the guilt of wanting to do something for yourself. Hope this film gets more attention. Great film 5/5.",p3ztri
harc7v7,"It kind of bugs me that everyone feels the need to hedge their comments with a ""predictable and formulaic but still great"" line. A movie doesnt have to break new ground to be a great movie or considered special. If you make the greatest apple pie ever nobody is going to say, ""Yeah, it was a great pie but I saw the apples coming from a mile away"".",p3ztri
h8vwpnm,"30 year old man, I was a mess watching this movie. Wow",p3ztri
h8x3s12,I was kind of secretly hoping she would perform a gangster rap song for her father at the recital.,p3ztri
h8wg3sr,"Very cool that the film takes the decision of whether to go to college or not out of Ruby's hands. She's obviously willing to sacrifice a lot for her family, and they recognize that and realize that it's hindering her personal development. Love the message that the deaf community is not helpless and, while the efforts of people like Ruby are welcome, they can manage on their own.",p3ztri
h8wfpn4,This movie is great and it had me quite emotional. It is wonderfully acted and had a really unique and heartwarming story. Also why is Eugenio Derbez not listed as part of the cast on this post? His character is integral to the story and I thought he played it very excellent.,p3ztri
h90nhcz,"Can't believe there's not more comments in this thread. This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever watched. It could have been sappy, or gimmicky, or any number of things, and instead we get this piece of art. I thought it was low key genius how they used being deaf as a story telling device, it was all about being deaf but at the exact same time it mostly had no impact on the story, except for a few key scenes. 

My I've gripe is the dad and brother still going out with the inspector on board, and no Ruby. They're deaf, not idiots. What did they think would happen? Should have feigned engine trouble or something. Apart from that, 9/10.",p3ztri
h93g137,"CODA here and I loved this movie so much. I'm already a sucker for coming of age stories but this one really makes me feel seen in so many weird ways.

Like...the responsibility to interpret even at a young age when I'm so out of my depth. Feeling simultaneously guilty for wanting some independence from what my mom wants versus also...truly wanting to be there for your family. The times where...words can't explain how I feel as good as ASL can. Being really into music which is something my mom literally cannot relate to. ""Did you wish I was deaf?"" and the response. And there will never be anything as beautiful to me as when I simultaneously hear and see a song. CODA love. üíó

Edit: also I just wanna say while I related to the movie, it's certainly not like...the ""definitive CODA movie"", but also I don't think it tries to be, despite the name.",p3ztri
h8v9pr0,"Small scale, coming of age. 

Cried like a bitch.",p3ztri
h8yd0ay,the first two acts are super cheesy which makes the third act being an emotional gut punch even more impressive. all of a sudden turned me into a fan of the movie,p3ztri
h8ztgyr,"Everybody else is talking about how heartwarming and accurate the movie is, and I agree. But I also have to say I really loved Ruby‚Äôs singing in this one, her voice was honestly beautiful and I was surprised to find out the actor isn‚Äôt actually a professional singer",p3ztri
h8w89q8,"Absolutely brilliant movie.

It‚Äôs simple, predictable but still hits all the right emotional notes. Had me in tears the last 15-20 minutes.

Fantastic scenes at the show, the back of the truck and the finale.

As a first generation immigrant who had to translate for my parents all my life, I really connected with the awkwardness and resentment that can come with it.

Lots of funny moments as well that had me in stitches. 

Fantastic acting all across the board especially her father and her as well and her teacher too.

Simple movie but left a lasting impression and will be watching it again.

With shows like Ted lasso, mythic quest, schmigadoon, physical and movies like this Apple TV is becoming my favorite streaming service.",p3ztri
h8vy2ut,Can somebody tell me how was Eugenio Derbez? I think he plays a pianist or something,p3ztri
h8zuzu1,"One of the best movies I have watched this year. It is not pretentious, just all around great wholesome family movie with decent representation of people with deaf ears.

I was sobbing throughout the end when Emilia Jones sang Both Sides Now. She is fantastic in this movie and will go really far from here.",p3ztri
h906qo5,"Out of curiosity, what was the ASL that Ruby responded with to her family? Something similar to ü§ü, but with the middle finger wrapped around the index finger?",p3ztri
h999mlr,"I‚Äôll say this, it saddens me that movies like this are not more mainstream and get any sort of promotion to draw audiences in and be showered with the love it deserves.

So now I got to go out and let you all know that I loved this movie. It was another one of those silent treatment films that relies on you to come from it with a different perspective. You lose that one keen sense you are always taking for granted when you see a film. And now the shoe is on the other foot in a way. Not only that, the coming of age story is better than most and the acting in this was so god damn on point to bring about both laughter and heartfelt emotion. Best of both worlds for me.¬†

Emilia Jones you are going places!",p3ztri
h8w5k5c,"This was absolutely wonderful. Yes, the plot is a little predictable but it doesn‚Äôt matter because everything is just done so well and the very nature of the film makes it entirely unique. It was so genuinely hilarious and equally heartbreaking at points.",p3ztri
h8v716d,Really great movie.  Beautiful story. Pretty accurate about the Deaf culture.,p3ztri
h8y2udr,Bawled my eyes out.,p3ztri
h9cydn3,"Saw this back at virtual Sundance in January and it has really stuck with me since. One of the rare movies that gets better and better as it goes along. The first 30 minutes feel a bit corny, but the last 30 minutes just elevate the film to that ""special sauce"" level. Deaf Culture and ASL really lends itself well to the visual medium of cinema, a lot of vibrancy and movement in the framing. Hope we see more films with Deaf actors taking center stage.

&#x200B;

Great flick.",p3ztri
h8v9v83,"If I were a nascent streaming service, I‚Äôll want a film like Coda. Low budget but great, so as to build some prestige. Nice to see better representation of the deaf community in recent years through films like this and Sound Of Metal.",p3ztri
h8zvpob,This was *absolutely* fantastic. I smell a lot of noms!,p3ztri

hkaeqb1,"Wow! I don't understand all these complements. the movie was SO CHEESY I almost puked.

It was a clich√© movie. We all saw the ridiculous and cheesy scenes before. Agh! the strict teacher(if you can't pronounce RRRRRRR don't say my name)  

Cried for the film? COME ON!",p3ztri

h93ric5,Well that was excellent.,p3ztri
h8wifa1,"I saw the original in the theatre years back and then yesterday it popped into my head and I made a note to rewatch it.

Later I saw this one pop on VoD, thought the plot sounded familiar only to realize it was a remake of Le Famille Belier. 

What a weird coincidence.

Anyway, how does this one compare to the original?",p3ztri
h907te0,I think with everything happening in the world right now we need more sweet and wholesome content like this movie. It hit in all the right feels and just what I needed right now. With this and Ted Lasso I hope Apple tv keeps giving us more feel good movies/tv shows.,p3ztri
hbthm1y,"Just saw the movie last night.  This is a movie really about how good execution trumps predictability.  Things I was expecting in the movie:

* Heavy thumping bass soundtrack to show how deaf people hear/feel the vibrations
* Audio completely stopping at some point so we get POV of the deaf family
* Female lead signing song to her family

The scene where Ruby's parents picks her up while playing gangster rap in the truck was well done fairly early in film.  I thought the director had blown it with not turning the sound off during the coast guard scene and Ruby not signing during her choir duet.

But that third act really hits you like a gut punch.  Seeing how the family discussing errands while she's singing and then the audio going silent while they take in the audience reaction and Frank ""hearing"" her sing by placing her hands on her vocal cords.  It did a wonderful job of seeing the gift that Ruby has to offer.

Also the Berklee audition where they appear in the balcony and Ruby spontaneously signs the Joni Mitchell song to show she still has a connection to her family showed how execution and timing is so important in a movie in building to a proper climax.  Kudos to Sian Heder for the story and timing and also to Emilia and Troy for their scene near the end on the back of the truck.",p3ztri
h8vsv5o,pleasant surprise seeing connor lawlor in this!,p3ztri
h9agzrz,"Like many have said here, the movie is very predictable. But the emotions were very honest. Wonderful movie. I laughed out loud in many scenes. I'll definitely watch multiple times.",p3ztri
h99d2oi,"Man, I didn‚Äôt expect to cry since there were two scenes that I thought were going to get me (forgot what they were). But it was those last few scenes that delivered. The truck, the soundless concert, and saying goodbye. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more but dang. Great look at being in a deaf family from many perspectives. I couldn‚Äôt help but think of Sound of Metal (last year‚Äôs personal favorite). To completely different sides of the deaf community that got me the feels in totally different ways.

Edit: Also! I was happy to see the lead from Song Street again. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo. He got so big.",p3ztri
h8w7be3,Was not expecting this movie to destroy me like it did. During the breathing exercise scene in the classroom i joined in because I was literally having a mild panic attack. Easily the best movie I‚Äôve seen this year.,p3ztri
h9jnv8e,"Watched it this morning and I thought it was absolutely incredible; especially after being kind of disappointed by Free Guy, which I saw yesterday.

Definitely needs a Blu Ray release so it isn't trapped on Apple TV+ forever and I can watch it after my 6 month trial from PlayStation is over.",p3ztri
hx07ene,"As a pianist and graduate of two music degrees, I can confirm that the audition scene would absolutely never have in four billion years been a success. I‚Äôve accompanied for many auditions that went exactly like that, and it would be preposterous to expect her to be accepted. That is clearly not Berklee, but even if it were, they would never have let her teacher come in like that and take over. Once she had that hiccup, that would have been the end of the audition. Also, that song would never be appropriate for a conservatory audition, and never in a million years would her family have been able to sneak in like that and the faculty be okay. It‚Äôs almost like the writers of this movie did exactly zero research into conservatory etiquette. Anyway, rant over. I hated this movie lol",p3ztri
hblw6ib,I am blown away by this movie. The story line is so powerful.,p3ztri
hr4aaij,"My wife and I watched the entire movie, commenting on how bold of a directorial choice it was to not have subtitles for all the ASL. And while at times we would have loved to know what they were saying, we got enough from context clues and facial expressions that we didn't miss anything.  
We thought it was supposed to be partial commentary on how deaf people experience the world around them without having the same information as hearing people.  
Then when reading reviews, discovered that our Fire TV stick must have glitched and the sub-titles didn't show up, because the were there when we restarted it. Had to fast forward through and rewatch all the family scenes to see how far off our ""here's what I think just happened"" were.  
If i'm being 100% honest, I think not knowing what they were saying made my experience more moving and I would recommend it to people.",p3ztri
i2aahpz,"All this movie has going for it is deaf representation. Remove that and you have a cliche ridden formulaic movie. I was ready to turn the damn thing off when the music teacher started talking. I think there's a good story of a character like Ruby trying to find themselves while dealing with their deaf family but what we are given is so undercooked. 

She doesn't join choir out of a love for singing, she did it because she wanted to be with a boy. There's no real establishment of her love of music or that she always sang growing up despite her family being deaf. But lo and behold she joins the choir can hit all the notes, the teacher takes notice of her and tutors her. He tells her she should go to Berklee. Does she genuinely want to go and pursue music all of a sudden? Yeah she was only focused on her family's business through like all of high school but now she decides to go with the first choice presented. Never mind she says her grades are shit. 

But she passes the audition perfectly and despite the financial hardship of her family the teacher just waves that all aside with the word scholarship. We don't even get her high school graduation just fast forward off to college. Oh don't worry the family business is even better now. The government is presented as this one dimensional evil entity just sticking it to the working man, but regulations on fishing are necessary. Over fishing is a concern.

End of the day this movie just didn't seem to have anything genuine to say. It was emotionally manipulative and knew just how to make the audience feel good.",p3ztri
h91lfjn,"great movie, i heard about this back during Sundance, and it lives up to that hype. If this was on Netflix, i feel like it would be a much bigger deal

acting is great, the lead is a star in the making. Loved seeing Eugenio Derbez pop up here, and the 3 deaf family members knocked it out of the park

i do have questions about the logic in the family dynamic- mainly: how did the parents manage to live their entire lives (seemingly) just fine, but in the film it felt like without Ruby they would just fall apart out in the real world? As well as things like: why not have the news crew provide an ASL translator (most would have access to someone like that wouldnt they?), as well as the surveyor not knowing in advance they were deaf - their entire dock group/fellow fishermen all knew, as well as the management. Nobody would put a note when they assigned her ""hey, this boat has hearing impaired people on board"". idk, im also not in that world, so i could be off there.",p3ztri
h90wpxc,"Cheesy but very sweet and I enjoyed it a lot. Along with the deaf representation I thought the movie also nicely explored issues related to class in a non-preachy way, both by showing the struggles of the family and by showing how the main character felt out of place when she showed up for her audition and was dressed differently from the others, etc.",p3ztri
hey23k5,"This movie keeps opening up for me -- even through watching clips on YT.  For instance, in the audition scene, I noticed, in the montage, that Ruby was teaching Miles ASL.  Then I noticed it was finger spelling (because I recognized ""I"" and ""L"" from ASL ""I love you"").  Then I realized Ruby was teaching Miles to spell his name.  Then I noticed her *speaking* the letters as she signed them, even though the soundtrack was Both Sides, Now.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tUnx8RGsTPQ&t=3m2s

Along the way, I've taught myself all the letters.  Tomorrow, I will take my first ASL class ever.  It is being taught by a Deaf person.  I'm really looking forward to it.

It's not an exaggeration to say ""CODA"" has palpably changed my life.",p3ztri
hycva3s,"I'm not gonna qualify this with ""this is very formulaic *but*"" like the film completely redeems itself. It is a major problem, and it drags the overall quality of the movie down. I hate plots primarily driven by entirely avoidable scheduling conflicts. I hate characters like the teacher who talk in scriptese rather than like a normal person. I hate unearned romances that happen because we think the main character deserves one for his or her journey. The issue isn't its predictability, these tropes are a waste of runtime that could be spent doing something engaging.

Now of course that's not to say there isn't a lot of good stuff in this movie too. They handle the CODA issues very well, which is presumably the whole point. The family arguments when it's just the four of them are the best parts of the movie. And it ended so strongly. Sometimes a movie chooses the perfect song and that does all the work. Both Sides Now is a powerful choice.

The teacher ridicules Glee and then chooses a bunch of Glee-esque songs for everyone to sing. A cappella Motown for suburban white kids! I love how she listens to the Shaggs on vinyl, that's a pretty good personality detail right there. From what I can tell they were kind of the Rebecca Black of their day, their record being a vanity project that's mainly famous for being so bad it's funny. And who compares their best singer, whose voice is supposed to get them into a conservatory, to Bob Dylan? I love Bob Dylan's music, and I'm sure this teacher does too, but it sure as hell isn't his voice! He's an all-time great *songwriter*, which isn't the skill she's working on. 

Goddamn, where were all these sexually aggressive girls when I was in high school? I feel like I stepped into a TV comedy for a few scenes there.  

Probably shouldn't have been nominated for Best Picture, all things considered. Sound of Metal was way better.",p3ztri

hj3xqmm,"This movie is incredible. I‚Äôm a sucker for coming of age films, and I found myself wishing that this had been a tv show cause I wanted more of everything. About what happens after, what happened before the opening scene, and about the family themselves. Just all of it. Such a brilliant family drama, coming-of-age flick and I didn‚Äôt expect it to be as funny as it was throughout. Only ‚Äúweak‚Äù part would probably be the stuff with Miles, but only cause I liked the family dynamics and Mr V stuff immensely. 

Most people who want to watch Coda have probably already done so, and have likely talked about the more memorable, hard hitting scenes (as they should) but I wanted to point out a smaller one that I was caught off guard by. It‚Äôs when Ruby is signing with her mom about her pursuing music for the first time and her mom assumes that it‚Äôs a phase and says something along the lines of ‚Äúwould you want to be a painter if we were blind?‚Äù.

i1xs43c,"This movie destroyed me on about 5 different levels and I don't know how to properly vocalize why. I have no personal experience with any of the elements depicted in the film, but there is just so much empathy expressed within. The non-hearing actors are all amazing and I think it's impossible not to fall in love with Emilia Jones's character. I cried for the entire 1 hour 50 minute running time for so many varying reasons and I still can't understand exactly why this film had such a profound effect on me. It's been a long time since a movie has elicited that much raw emotion from me.

I've seen all the Oscar-nominated films now, and while I can recognize them all as great and important works of art, none of them made me feel the way this film did. I loved Drive My Car and I found it very thought-provoking in its exploration of grief, but it didn't connect for me the same way. I admired Don't Look Up for its urgent message and satirical look at the end of the world, which I dubbed ""Idiocracy 2."" And I found the endings of Nightmare Alley and Power of the Dog to be very powerful, but aside from those indelible images imprinted on my memory, the rest of the movie didn't connect with me on a personal level.

You literally feel how deaf parents feel when they saw their daughter sang a song. You cannot hear her, but just watch surroundings and see reactions from other people.

i5a1o49,"I tried watching the movie over the weekend. I guess what passes for realism on film these days really grossed me out, and I decided to pass. In the first half hour or so we meet the disgusting parents. The dad rips off a smelly fart at the dinner table and excuses it because deaf people can appreciate the smell. Is there a single person on earth who would say that -- hearing or deaf? Then there's the jock itch doctor scene, where these adult people seem to have no clue and subject their young daughter to extremely inappropriate information about their low level of hygiene. Again, could this possibly be real and in what world? Finally, we are subjected to the grossest humping scene, where again the father justifies it to his daughter's friend -- a guest in the house. Seriously? I switched it off right then and there. Sometimes ""real"" is just uncivilized or there only for, oh, I dunno, laughs (not funny). I found the school scenes, while less gross, completely cringy, including the Rolling R teacher, who we already know must have a heart of gold. It all just felt overheated, without an ounce of subtlety, and thus unwatchable. Perhaps had I stuck with the whole movie, I would have ended up liking it better, but I really didn't want to know anymore about these people.",p3ztri

The scene when the film goes silent and you are in the POV of her deaf family was amazing and really got the point across both that they couldn't really judge what was going on during the recital, and yet by the reactions from the audience they can tell that she is really good.

i3cw58h,"Saw this movie a couple of days ago, and it was OK. Hits all the necessary marks and has some moving scenes. 100% not Best Picture material, if you ask me.

I definitely couldn't enjoy it nearly as much as others have here, though. I think the main reason is because I've seen La Famille Belier (the original movie this script was adapted from) and it pulls SO much from that movie...at points it almost feels like a shot for shot recreation, which isn't a good thing in my eyes. 

I wonder if La Famille Belier didn't reach a big audience in the US... I am from Colombia and pretty much anyone who likes cinema knows that movie by heart.",p3ztri
i4sperh,"Sadly, I don‚Äôt resonate very much after watching the film.
I like Emilia Jones very much. I adore her performance in Patrick, and she portrays such a lovely, strong character as Ruby in CODA. Yet in a semi-musical film, her singing performance was just not as mesmerizing as I expected. Literally when I watched her sing each time in the film, I wished the scenes would be more powerful. I know she trained hard for the role, maybe I‚Äôm too picky, but I genuinely think a singer-actor would be a better fit to the role in terms of the musical tension. For example, the Irish indie film Once starred by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova was an astonishingly beautiful musical film.

Emilia‚Äôs singing also diminishes the gravity of the climax scene of the audition when she sang Both Sides Now. It is such a beautiful song that I‚Äôve always loved, yet her voiced doesn‚Äôt have a shocking power that strikes me to the bones. Again, the power I felt when I watched Once, the rock musics and choruses took place in the climax when the outstanding singers/protagonists expressed emotions and feelings through facial expressions and voices. In CODA I didn‚Äôt have that transcending feeling. 

Criticisms aside, maybe the texture of CODA is more realistic than dramatic. It is illustrated in portraying the deaf communities and worlds, maybe also in Ruby‚Äôs singing. After all she‚Äôs just a teenager girl, I shouldn‚Äôt get my hopes too high. Yet I kind of have my feeling stuck in the middle and not expressed fully when the movie ended. I don‚Äôt resonate very much with the rest of the audiences who cried buckets, not that I don‚Äôt have a heart or I lack taste, I have a father whose hearing was impaired all his life after an AOM attack, I had trouble communicating with him and my other families for my entire life and I fully understand the bitter taste when you hardly can share thoughts, hardships with families and have to stick it out all on your own. It‚Äôs just the film is not as realistic as it is when it comes to the difficulties faced by the family and Ruby‚Äôs life. Ruby got into Berkeley and her family‚Äôs business is prospering. Yes the road to the end was difficult, but the hardships were delineated less realistic than the real life situations when you know it can get REALLY REALLY hard, and harder in the situation of deaf communities. The texture of the film feels like a Disney movie, but not as dramatic and romantic as a Disney movie.

But again, maybe this is the picky critic in me that‚Äôs been roasting. I‚Äôve never scene another film that focuses on the disabilities with such genuine plots, character arcs and emotional base. It is a delight to watch CODA, and I‚Äôm going to rewatch it many times to appreciate the performance of Emilia, Troy and other lovely actors.",p3ztri
i5pnl2v,"Hi please correct me if I completely missed the cue but this movie is amazing. The only thing that is driving me kind of nuts is this: how did the family know she had an audition? I just watched the movie and tried to find when they were told about the event. The only moment I can really find is when Mr. V told Runy to sign ""you're making a mistake not letting your daughter audition for Berklee"" but other than that, it seems like a convenient plot hole for her family to drive to her audition. Again, please correct me if I'm wrong it's bothering me so much lol",p3ztri
i5v1b9f,"8 mean. We're all on the same page that it was a full trope, completely expected, nothing impressive with the storyline, right?

i6v6mv7,"Kind of nitpicky, but one thing that drove me nuts is, would it even be remotely possible for someone to get into Berklee based on essentially a karaoke performance of a Joni Mitchell song?  Then at the other extreme you would have jazz pianists of supreme talent practicing hours a day and learning theory and having an encyclopedia of repertoire also competing for spots.  I could see her passing an American Idol audition with that performance, but that seems to be mistaken for Berklee here.

h8yixg9,"Hi, I‚Äôm actually Deaf and I wholeheartedly agree with what OP just said. First of all, all three Deaf actors were wonderful and it was amazing to see them use ASL onscreen, however, they deserve a better script than this ableist-packed story. 

This movie was written and directed by a hearing woman who have never met a Deaf person or had any involvement in the Deaf community until it went into the production. I have met my share of CODAs and some are my good friends. They are as embarrassed as I am by this poor excuse of ‚Äúrepresentation‚Äù for the Deaf community. 

This movie was catered to the hearing audience and in each scene, they were enforcing harmful stereotypes upon the Deaf characters (not enjoying music, loud and animalistic sex, overly graphic sign language aka the sign for herpes which is NOT REAL to the actual one, and incompetent to be independent). 

Many Deaf parents I know refuse to use their hearing children as interpreters and they‚Äôre more independent than this movie makes them out to be. The lack of professional ASL interpreters in this movie is laughably bad because in the real life, it‚Äôs against the law to not provide ASL interpreting for doctor appointment, court, and even press interviews. But I guess having ASL interpreters in this story would poke a lot of plot holes. 

You may ask why Deaf actors would take those roles if it‚Äôs that bad? Because there are not enough roles out there for Deaf actors and they need to work so they take what they can since far too many hearing actors keep taking those roles from actual Deaf actors (Sound of Metal, The Stand, Hush). 

We deserve better than this and please don‚Äôt take this movie as an authentic representation of our community and our experiences because it‚Äôs not.

EDIT:

I love music. My Deaf friends love music. We attend music festivals every summer. We have hearing friends who are musicians, singers, and in bands. They invite us to their shows and we show up to support them. So, this stereotype of Deaf people not enjoying music is exhausting.

This same statement applies to literally ALL people, hearing and hearing impaired. But your logic, every person who has a child naturally is selfish as opposed to adopting. 

And who gets to decide where that line is dream on who gets to procreate? You do realize that deaf children do also get born to two parents with perfect hearing, right?

Look into the long and ugly history of eugenics if you're still not understanding how bad your comment is.

Even more important - you seem to be severely underestimating the complications of placing a hearing child with two deaf parents. Especially since nearly all kids placed from foster/adoption programs come with trauma and social issues.",p3ztri

This is an interesting perspective! It did sometimes feel like the deaf family members were used as the punchlines of jokes.

But at the same time, it feels a little harsh to say that *every* scene was like that. For instance, when her brother on the beach was venting his frustrations. The brother seemed a very independent character, frustrated with hearing people sometimes but not helpless and not wanting to rely on his sister or even on interpreters at all

> The lack of professional ASL interpreters in this movie is laughably bad because in the real life, it‚Äôs against the law to not provide ASL interpreting for doctor appointment, court, and even press interviews. But I guess having ASL interpreters in this story would poke a lot of plot holes.

Revealing my own ignorance about this, but can ASL interpreters be provided for free for families that can‚Äôt afford them? I would assume the government would have to do that by law, at least for some things like court hearings. But it seemed like the inability to afford one on the boat was a plot point, and perhaps that might be why, at least within the world of the story, the family has come to rely on the daughter for some interactions with hearing people.

But also more broadly if the movie has the daughter translating in situations where it‚Äôs actually illegal for her to be doing so, clearly the research could‚Äôve been better!
