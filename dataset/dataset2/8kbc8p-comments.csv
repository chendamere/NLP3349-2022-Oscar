dzdt5al,"Overall it was an ok movie. Some of the scenes were macabre, and great for a zombie film. Too bad that a lot of the decisions by the main character were just dumb. I know emotions can lead to irrational things, but there should be some limits like: 

[
1) Your wife is about to transform? How about we use that mouth protector in our medkit, instead of damaging the cars door and entrapping yourself, and your kid with a soon to be zombie? 
2) You meet a guy who is obviously a maniac, and an abuser. How about we don't leave our kid there? Or at least kill him, after he tried to kill you. Kill the maniac while he is sleeping, leave kid with the woman that seems to have a good heart, and lives in a protected base. 
3) You know you are infected, you have green slimy stuff all over your mouth. Maybe not the best idea to kiss the kid near the eye?

It's a character drama using the zombie idea.  I really enjoyed it, well worth a watch.  You've got nothing to do today...put it on!! :-)",8kbc8p
dz78wny,"I really enjoyed this movie. 

SO many creative ideas for the zombie genre. Such as calling them diggers and ghosts, seeing them with their heads underground, the fluid that secretes over the eyes and mouth and infected areas of the body. The “48 hour” concept was done well.

 I’m glad they never fully explained certain things - like what exactly happened to the world? Was it certain countries or the majority- they explain briefly that India wasn’t diseased as opposed to Australia. Why the diggers would keep their heads underneath? They mention the hibernation but it’s still interesting.

Certain set pieces also like when they come in contact with the family he sees previously on the river in the beginning of the film. 

Martin Freeman does an excellent job and so does Simone Landers who played Thoomi. ",8kbc8p
dz8ghlz,"I can't help but feel there's a ""Noble Savage"" sentiment in Cargo. Apparently modern society has collapsed, and everybody is fleeing and getting picked off one by one by the zombie outbreak, except... the Aborigines who reverted to their ""old ways"" and are apparently doing better than anyone else that we know of. 

I just don't know what the movie wants me to do with this. What am I supposed to understand about Aborigine culture now? That they are good at surviving? That they have some sort of wisdom that is lost to the modern world? Whatever it was, the movie didn't convey it well.",8kbc8p

dzmk503,"There's a really great zombie movie in the background of this movie.

Australian aborigines thriving amid total world collapse, to the point they're actively hunting and purging zombies. 

Zombie emergency kits including count down timers, mouth guards, restraints and a euthanasia tool. Indicating the governments didn't collapse immediately and there was enough time to effectively start controlling the endemic. 

Zombies that are real zombies, but exhibit interesting and potentially freaky behaviour. Leaving slime trails, burying their heads etc. Imagine a protagonist walking through an empty town, only to turn the corner and see a field of zombies with their heads buried in the ground, some struggling, some completely still.

Instead we got some poorly hashed out clone of a great stand alone short movie. If I was helming this, I would of had that whole 'father sacrifices himself' as a brief backstory to a bigger story of a zombie out break and rebuild of civilisation. There should of been a 'westernised civilisation trying to rebuild and survive' vs the 'aboriginal back to nature civilisation trying to rebuild and survive'. 

Since the movie lasted much longer than the short, they should of extending the zombie bite turn time from 48 hours to 48 days. Imagine hundreds of people walking round with watches, slowly divulging into zombie urges, getting outcast from civilisation, rounded up. The ticking bomb of families saying good bye, trying to stay together to the last minute.

dz9kcqf,"I liked it because it was a fresher take on zombies, and was more story driven instead of action, but apparently, it was supposed to be ""emotionally brutal"" except for the ending I didn't see any emotion or at least good representation of emotion. Any scene that seemed like it was supposed to make you feel something didn't because the actors/characters acted like they didn't feel anything, like they knew it was a movie and everything that was happening had no repercussions or lasting effect. Especially [in the beginning, Freeman's characters reaction to everything that just happened was...a weak shout? Like he just left work and on his drive home realized that he forgot his phone or something. You'd think anyone in his situation would be absolutely devastated after that or show some hint of sadness or depression.](#spoiler)

I liked the unique take on the governments' response to the outbreak/those that get bit. Emergency kits that essentially tell you that you're screwed and have max 48 hours before you have to use the included epi-pen device that injects a metal spike in your skull instead of medication.",8kbc8p

No zombies shown and you didn't really have any idea what was going on/ but you could tell that something was off, and it gave off a really eerie vibe which was really good. It wore off as the movie went on, but I liked the sense of urgency that developed as you watched Freeman descend into a zombie like state.

However, this movie had some writing and plot struggles. There were a lot of cliches, and some weak performances that held the movie back. The whole aboriginal side-plot was nice and a nice sort of outside look on the Australian Aborigine, but I didn't really feel any sort of connection to that side of the story, or the characters, like Thoomi or the Clever Man. [The way Lorraine died was just plain annoying and seemed so cliche and forced.  And jesus fuck, how many times did Andy put his INFECTED ASS MOUTH near any part of Rosie's face!!!!! Jesus christ, he probably infected her in that last scene because she put her mouth around his god damn nose!](#spoiler)

This had potential to be a really good movie, but a couple of poorly executed plot devices and performances kind of held it back a little.

I feel like a 6.7-6.8/10 on it. It definitely does not deserve to be shit on so hard like some people are on this thread, but it's not great either. I'd give it a watch, as it does pull some heart-strings, and I thought Martin Freeman was excellent.",8kbc8p

Some of the performances were just so lackluster, especially Vic and his wife, and the younger indigenous girl. Also, what was up with the editing? It would cut from Martin Freeman and his daughter from one place to the other with no establishing shots to show where they were now, and that was on a fairly constant basis.

dzh75jc,"The movie was ok. I just really can’t stand it when characters make predictably awful decisions that make you think “Why?  That is so dumb, why would anyone do that”. A few examples.

1.) The wife going into the boat with knee deep murky water during a zombie apocalypse. Maybe it’s the Floridian in me but its incredible stupid to go into murky unfamiliar water here even when zombies aren’t present. There could be snakes or worse down there and in this case “worse” could mean zombies.

2.) Staying in the car with his wife who was turning without any sort of safe guard or plan in case she turned early. This was crazy to me because my priority would have been my daughter. At this point his wife is soon to be gone, so by him dying too he’s essentially left his daughter alone in the world. And it was totally and easily an avoidable situation.

3.) Not killing the psychopath. I can understand people disagreeing with me on this one, because killing someone no matter the circumstances can’t be easy. But this was so obvious. Best case scenario even if they escaped, this guy was hunting them down. Not to mention this guy had just trapped a kid just so he can loot dead bodies. He was evil. They should’ve taken him out or at the very least trapped him and lived in his gated community.

That’s the end of my rant.",8kbc8p

dzlp58c,"This film is based on the short film of the same name that was made for the Tropfest film festival. It's great to see the short film be made into a feature-length film to explore the characters and story more thoroughly. It diverts slightly from the short film but the general idea is still the same. The first act in the film is the weakest part of the film and could have been cleaned up a little. The acting was good for the most part, except for the child actor. I recommend this film, especially if you wanted to see what the short film would be like as a feature-length film.

dzhullm,"I didn’t think this film was terrible, but at the same time it didn’t leave any lasting effect on me either.

Also. Was anyone else left scratching their head just wondering why, and how in the entire hell did Andy managed to stupidly get himself bitten like that? 

Not for the fact that he wasn’t willing to off his wife. But when the car crash happened, his wife was impaled by a tree trunk which I would presume left her immobile. 
knowing her unwillingness to turn and harm her own family she would of managed to crawl or stumble out of the car when she knew that she was doomed. Now that being said, he wakes up from passing out. Finds out his wife turned. Oh, which by the way I don’t know I mentioned the fact that she was IMPALED in place. Just jams his forearm directly within reach of her mouth to retrieve their baby when he could of easily just got out of his door and opened the back door to grab Rosie...
I rewatched it again to make sure and there isn’t anything barricading him into the car that made him resort to that sort of action as a do or die situation.

dzbow4i,"I thought it was a bit *eh*. In all honesty with it starring Freeman I expected more. 

I thought the introduction/first twenty minutes or so were pretty good, they did a good job of hinting that something was seriously wrong without screaming 'ZOMBIES' or 'APOCALYPSE'. After that however it went down hill.

It really felt like it the writers hadn't quite adapted it right for a full length film, the pacing felt strange and awkward.

I really liked those orange first aid kits, shows a government was competent in ""trying"" to deal with the situation. The only negative thing I will say about it Cargo is that overall I feel indifferent about the movie, and that's not really a bad thing. It didn't feel like I wasted my time watching it, nor did it offend me.

dz9v2jb,"the short film this movie is based on was better imo. 

i mostly enjoyed this movie and  i do like Martin Freeman but he either isn't a very good actor or he just didn't play this role in a convincing way (for the most part). other than a couple of moments here and there, he acted like he was a tad tired from a long day at work rather than a man who just lost his wife and was trying to save his daughter in an apocalypse. there were some key moments in the film that demanded overt anguish/devastation in the events going on and Freeman had pretty much the same ""slightly tired from a long day at work"" expression. the actress playing Thoomi was fantastic though and the baby was adorable. i prefer the short film this movie was based on. it makes me cry every time i watch it.

and don't even get me started on the god awful writing to have the wife risk her life (and that of her family) to go and get a fucking razor blade from the other stranded boat. that and the poor writing/filming of the scene where the father gets bitten by the wife. it looked completely unrealistic. the way that scene was filmed/blocked it looks like he willingly puts his arm within her bite range. ",8kbc8p
dzb6b94,"I absolutely hated Martin Freeman's character in this movie. He was actually an awful person. 

First of all, not warning his wife about the zombie in the yacht because she'd be angry he put himself in danger was incredibly stupid. The chances of her trying to scope out the boat again where always going to be quite high. I'm also annoyed that she apologised to him. It was his fault. I thought they were going to have a moment where put of guilt he'd admit that he knew there was zombie there and that she'd forgive him and I'm stunned they didn't. It makes him look like an incrediblely selfish coward.

Then, the moment where she was perched under the tree and asked to end it. That would have been perfect for her. They both knew she had no hope and that way she could go out in peace, in a lovely setting, in her own mind, before she got too sick, before she's a danger to her family and maybe even with her husband and daughter in her arms.

But he then ignores her, forces her into the car, locking her in. As a result she ends up dying in a horrible situation, in much more pain and then causing harm to her family.

And then he had multiple chances to kill Vic which he didn't take. He saw that he was enslaving people for bait and in spite of that, in spite of having a loaded rifle and Vic's trust and thus the opportune moment to kill this horrible person, he decides he's satisfied for this man and his sex slave to raise his daughter. And then, again, he had a chance to kill Vic in his sleep and he didn't take it, resulting in Lorraine's death.

Lastly he makes no attempt to stop a man from a triple murder homicide. He doesn't even try to dissuade him, he just walks away; not his problem. ",8kbc8p

e7bqm4t,"I just watched Train to Busan and really enjoyed it. Cargo came up on my feed, so I decided to give it a shot. 


My biggest gripe: 


Why did Andy tell Kay the abandoned boat was safe? I thought it was clear to him that something was in that cupboard, and that’s why he had to get out immediately. Seems like an important detail you wouldn’t want to leave out to your wife when you’ve been in survival mode for a couple of weeks. From that scene, I thought it made it just a bit too obvious that Kay would go check it out herself and get bit in the process. 


Overall:


I liked the movie for its social commentary and character development—but felt that some things were forced. Compared to Train to Busan, the antagonist in Cargo is more realistic because he still possesses some humanity—even weeks after the outbreak. I‘d like to see a short showing how Andy and Kay were able to survive the initial outbreak with Rosie and make it to the river.

It did fall into retarded humans vs zombies trap though as most of the issues could have been easily prevented with a bit of caution. The Vic arc was completely unnecessary and felt utterly pointless.  

I wish this movie would have taken 28 days later or The Road route to not insult human inteligence that much. Be it a bit more darker and slower. Just the guy traveling around with his daughter looking for home and everything falls short.

The original premise of an infected father looking for new home for his daughter is amazing but execution is just unsatisfactory.

Part of me did, part of me didn't. They made obviously clear the white people are idiots/scum and all aboriginals are good because they practice some 'old ways' that we simply don't understand. And those old ways seem to be killing the zombies with some lame martial arts. And we all knew that the baby would go to the aboriginals.

1.  She only went into the overturned boat because Andy already had and Andy told her that it was safe and there was nothing to worry about (because she was concerned that he left the boat with how dangerous it is, essentially the point you are making).    I did wonder why she did not tell him where she was bitten (on the boat) and I think this is because she did not want him to feel that it was his fault.

2.   I think certain points need to be accepted within the films own universe and one of the those points is that you can time, quite accurately, how long it takes to turn.   Andy is asked multiple times in the film how much time he has left on his 'count' when they notice the watch.   This seems to indicate that people are aware that there is a set time to turn.   Andy was not concerned with his wife turning early in the same way that other characters (who knew that Andy was infected) did not flee from Andy because he was timing it.  I imagine that it had been proven enough, in events before the films timeline starts, that there is a set time.

3. Could not agree more.    This for me was the only real cliche.

Edit:   
I think I am wrong on point 2.  As others have pointed out Andy specifically says that bleeding out causes you to change faster so it would not be possible to time the turn accurately. ",8kbc8p

I watched Cargo on Netflix and was deeply disappointed by the high review score on IMDB, the reviews there (5 when I watched it) and the actual quality of the movie.

I saw zero acting from Martin Freeman, just his usual quirkiness that did not match the severity of the situation he was in. You would imagine when you lost your wife and the mother of your kid, you would be devastated by it and have moments of desperation and depression showing through throughout the movie. None of that, nothing, nadda, like he was walking in a park and carrying a bag of groceries and worrying if he got all that he needed for his dinner. 

And the the plotholes...sigh. What about the the yellow pus on the baby's diaper? I thought the baby was infected somehow. But I guess he was extremely and bizarly sloppy when changing the diapers? You know, smearing pus and poop on the outside maybe? How did the Wise Man suddenly escape his cage? Why did he not stay with teacher? That seemed like a safe place to drop his kid off. And I don't know about you, but I can't possibly fill a small cardboard box with enough supplies that last for three months.

hell we've had a very famous meta zombie movie too now(zombieland) so just seeing a ""family deals with zombie apocalypse, drama ensues"" movie isn't good enough anymore.   
the zombie movie genre is too saturated to be good. same reason why we don't see lone detective working out a case movies doing well anymore. it's all very been there seen that for movie audiences.    
i'm sure if you showed this movie to someone who's never seen a zombie movie before(likely a kid) they'd be terrified/spooked and moved by the end of the movie. for me personally i was chortling at all the stupid decisions(just because your husband said an area is safe doesn't mean it's not unsafe now - anything could have been attracted by your husbands noise and taken residence later you dumb moronic character) and how the crazy guy was relatively normal for a zombie movie. also yet again i'm surprised that baby survived to the end. that thing should be dead almost immediately - you know how weak baby's immune systems are? one kiss from an infected but not zombified person should have sealed that poor child's fate",8kbc8p

A lightswitch surprise doesn't imply a jump scare. It implies a surprise for a character, not the audience. Take a look at the [TV tropes article](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightswitchSurprise) I mentioned.

>It's not a zombie movie, no one comes back from the dead, the virus doesn't kill them and there's no evidence that they crave other humans for food but rather to spread the infection.

This is just a bunch of arbitrary criteria which is far from defining the genre. Cargo is considered a zombie movie by Newsweek, The Verge, Thrillist, Entertainment Weekly, Inverse, Metro, and a lot more publications than I can be bothered to link here.

The story is using the end of the world theme, and that theme comes with the hard choices it takes to survive in that new world, especially coming from the civilized one. Characters need to develop and change and that change takes heroic effort, this guy was just running towards a goal without ever addressing why and how he was going to get there.

dzakut8,"I mean he did leave thoomi for dead multiple times. But this is exactly what I mean. The whole point of the short was a father doing anything for his daughter.

dz9gr4m,"No matter how much you think it's splitting hairs, it's not.  That scene was in a school, the hospital is next door, it's not an abandoned hospital, it's next door to an abandoned hospital.

By your linked article, you're far more wrong than I am.  In that linked article a lightswitch scare is one where a character is just about to turn on the lights when they are startled by their significant other or parent saying ""hello X"".  That doesn't happen AT ALL.  Not even close.  He is no where near a lightswitch, and the woman never says a single word, and was not waiting up for him and does not know him and it is not related to the article you linked in any way at all and you were better off before you tried to correct me.

It's not a zombie movie, there are no zombies in the movie.  I can link you to a whole bunch of news articles that call Donald Trump the best president in history but that doesn't make it accurate.  It's an apocalyptic virus movie.  Sure the infected are very similar to zombies, but they aren't the undead.

I can link to a bunch of articles that correct all the others who call it a zombie movie and I'm glad you linked to sources, but if a movie has a regular character that files his teeth to points, drinks the blood of humans and doesn't like getting a tan he's not actually a vampire.  A zombie is a zombie, this movie has something similar to zombies, but no zombies, thus not a zombie movie.",8kbc8p

dz9htsl,">In that linked article a lightswitch scare is one where a character is just about to turn on the lights when they are startled by their significant other or parent saying ""hello X"". 

This is not the definition. Try actually reading the article. The examples contains all sorts of different scenarios - party attendees, parents, spouses, friends, strangers and supernatural beings -- as well as the surpriser and the surprisee being the ones to turn on the lights.

dzictat,"> the father in the road

Exactly! He is the epitome of a character in the genre that you would expect: Scared shitless at all times, OVER cautious, haunted by the decisions and things he has to witness on a daily (to be fair it's only another legendary performance by Viggo - hard for anyone else to get close).

Meanwhile Cargo just felt so lighthearted, it walks a path in a genre that nobody wants to see. Day of the Dead or Shaun of the Dead, but not BORING and STUPID of the Dead. 

I honestly don't know what they were trying to do, so I am not trying to be harsh, I liked the boat thing, wish they would've stuck with that since it's the first thing I think of during a zombie apocalypse (get on a fucking boat)! But then it became '12 years an Aboriginee' about 20 minutes in, like wtf I don't care if the dude is racist at this point, fucking stay alive! ",8kbc8p

dz9iee7,"""After a long night with the guys, Bob comes home at 3 a.m., and walks into the room. He reaches for the light switch, until he hears a familiar voice saying nearby, ""Hello Bob."" It is his wife, Alice, perhaps in curlers and carrying a rolling pin. Bob is in for it now.
This is a trope most commonly found in Western Animation and sitcoms, where a married man is out later than usual and upon returning is suddenly surprised to see his wife, despite it being late at night, or just not expecting her at all. The room is usually dark. It can be expanded in all areas, like children coming home late at night with their parents waiting.""

The examples are like Wikipedia and are added by users and are not necessarily accurate portrayals of the trope, and reading some of the examples you want me to read is pretty clear on that with gems like this: ""Played for absolute drama in Peeps. She uses the darkness to test his reflexes, proving her suspicions he's a Peep.""

You don't pay close enough attention to the things you read or watch and therefore don't understand them.

At no point did I insult or downvote you, you resulted to at least one of those I can clearly see and more than likely both.  You can believe whatever you want to believe, I'm done talking to you, hopefully you paid close enough attention to see that.

dz84o0e,"Really? Can you think of no exceptions to such an obvious falsehood?

And fiction is full of one dimensional ""needy objects"" eg women in action movies, or men in romance movies, are frequently barely more than ciphers, their needs simply boxes that need to be ticked for the protagonist to feel fulfillment or achievement.

Amazingly, you seem to have missed the whole point of the baby in the movie, or it's dramatic function.
