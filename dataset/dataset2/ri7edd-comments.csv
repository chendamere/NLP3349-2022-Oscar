hovtkph,"Disclaimer: I've never seen the original or read the book.

Guillermo del Toro is my favorite director. I absolutely love his style and his stories. The first half of the film felt at home in a Del Toro flick. The darkness. The production design. The second half slowed, but still had some Del Toro touches.  I don't know why but the man loves tile walls and floors.

Overall I enjoyed it. The ensemble of fantastic actors came together for a dark story that was foreshadowed early on.

I did leave the theater confused about Cate Blanchett character's motive behind the double cross.  I wasn't sure if she just wanted the money, or she wanted to get back at him for humiliating her during his show.

Also. The murder / suicide in the middle of the film was SOOO loud!",ri7edd

hp4odd1,"There's been a few longer films this year and I'm glad this one didn't feel it. I thought it was pretty consistently entertaining.   


That being said....

This movie just felt weirdly shapeless to me. 

I know ""What's the point?"" is an overused/pointless criticism but in this case I really didn't know what I was supposed to get out of this experience.

The ending was incredibly telegraphed from the beginning of the film, which made it feel less weighty. 

Stanton fucks up and then pays in a pretty terrible way.. OK? 

He decides to start drinking because Dr. Ritter looks at him coy a couple of times. Later he suddenly shouts at Molly that he doesn't need her anymore. OK? 

His characterization was also all over the place. I don't think he, or any of the characters, had much in the way of motivation. So we're just watching archetypes go through things and have things happen to them - Molly is sweet and innocent, Ezra is arrogant, etc. 

I just wish there was more meat on the bone. I felt like in the end none of what happened really was of any consequence.",ri7edd

hplftmk,"Some things that were *chef kiss* splendid about the movie in my opinion:

* The very last line of the film is different in the book. The book version is “I was *made* for this.” vs. 2021’s “I was *born* for this.” Extremely small change that dramatically shifts the meaning of the movie. In the book the implication from made is that his transformation to a geek is the culmination of his life choices and what happened to him. del Toro’s “born” implies that this was Stan’s destiny. That regardless of what he did in his lifetime, his fate as a geek was inescapable.

* The fact that del Toro put the Rorschach tests on the walls of Dr. Ritter’s office. He mentioned this conveys a sense of perfectionism in her office, one that masked the hidden chambers. Which was symbolic of her character. Exquisite and put together, but at the same time a carefully crafted facade to mask her true intentions. 

* The main focus of the movie is obviously witnessing a full circle in Stan’s character development as he goes from looking down on the geek with a superiority complex, to becoming the geek himself at the lowest point in his life. This theme is represented symbolically by the Ferris wheel.

* In the book he is not the only one who’s life can be described as circular. Molly’s father was a compulsive gambler and her husband after leaving Stan also turns out to be a gambler. She too arrives where she started as the victim of a man’s addiction. Which hits hard IMO because as the most moral main character, you would think her morality would exempt her from this fate, evidently it does not.

* The line when Stan enters Dr. Ritter’s office for the first time, “Did you hear? We’re at war.” Stuck out to me but I wasn’t sure why. I later read that this A keeps the timeline of events in our peripheral, but more importantly B it’s not just the US that is at war, but war describes the relationship between Stan and Dr. Ritter perfectly. They both need to feel powerful and superior to the other. Their time spent in her office is a battle of the wits. You see their perspectives shift constantly from Dr. Ritter looking down on him, to Stan looking down on her to demonstrate the back and forth between them. I saw many people where confused by her character’s motives. I think at the end of it, she needed the last laugh on him. She was not motivated by money but power. Money was a tool to get power over Stan. She needed to beat him as his own game.",ri7edd

hp0ih3b,How a man that smart and good at scamming didn’t prevent Ezra Grindle would go running to “Molly” as a mad man? That scenario was very possible,ri7edd
hp40kez,"The set design was fantastic. Cate Blanchett's office was BEAUTIFUL, the round lounge where Stanton and Molly are performing their act was great, and the carnival in the first half was engaging and felt alive and bustling (the fun house scene where Bradley Cooper is looking for the geek was great). I loved all of the art deco in the second half.

Pretty disappointed in the character development and pacing. I honestly think that each major character could have used an extra scene cementing their motives in the movie, and that's saying a lot for a movie that I think was at least half an hour too long. 

I have a few issues with Bradley Cooper's character. To start, I didn't get why he joined the circus in the first place. Maybe I missed it, but they didn't explain at ALL that he was on the run, looking for a job, etc. I knew nothing about the movie going in and my hypothesis after the very first scene was that it was some mob hit. Then Bradley Cooper just gets on a bus and joins a circus on a whim? Surely he had a job or something right? I thought he was taking the bus back home or to the office or something. Really threw me off. 

I see lot of people saying that he's a ""think he's always the smartest in the room""-type character, but he starts off the movie SO incredibly meek. His lack of dialogue through the start of the movie almost had me convinced that he was playing a mute character. Then when he gets a bath at Zeena's, they do a terrible job selling him a suave, confident character (in fact it seems quite intentional that they were selling him as the opposite). But then he spends a few days as her Barker and all of a sudden he's got grade-A schmooze ability that he carries on through the rest of the film? The rest of the film plays out in a very circular manner, so I didn't get why didn't his confidence crash back down like the rest of him? It didn't sit with me.

Him starting to drink really threw me off as well. I thought they had done a good job setting him up as someone who would never drink, and not in the way that prepares you just enough to see him succumb. In the moment, it was just ""oh, that's weird, he said he would never drink but now he is. Cool."" I thought he was convincing enough when he told Cate Blanchett that he never drinks (Cate Blanchett pressing him saying ""Never. There's that word again."" left me wanting A LOT more in that discussion, but it was never really brought up again iirc), but small things like him fetching Pete a bottle of alcohol without taking even a small moment to consider a drink himself sold me that he wouldn't break. There was no foreshadowing at ALL, and him taking a sip from Blanchett's alcohol was not a satisfyingly dramatic, shocking twist because they hadn't set up the plot point that his father was an alcoholic. It becomes clear later in the movie how devastating this is (that scene is pretty much the turning point for his character arc), but you don't get that in the moment. His inevitable downfall after taking that drink felt predictable, but I didn't really know why because (again) that hadn't built up any weight to that action (aside maybe from foreshadowing with how it was Peet's downfall, too).

~~Super minor point, but the him having his father’s watch felt really underdeveloped too. I’m pretty sure they don’t explain that it’s his father’s watch at all until later in the movie, then have him say that he hates his father which imo throws out any emotional attachment that may have been built up to him owning it. Him pawning it off at the end still felt pretty sad, but I think the scene could have easily hit harder.~~ Edit: nvm, its mentioned when he goes to Zeena’s and talks to Pete

Not all scenes were terrible though. I thought the scene where the sheriff and police storm the carnival was a real bright spot in the movie. It was so satisfying watching Bradley Cooper talk his way out of that.

Thankfully the rest of the acting was pretty great. I really liked Bradley Cooper's performance regardless of how his character was written (his fluctuating accents kinda bothered me, but perhaps it's intentional and a throw back to when Zeena tells him to lay on different accents for different crowds) as well as Willem Dafoe's, Cate (lol it's spelled Cater in the post) Blanchett, Ron Perlman, and David Straithairn. Just a shame to see such great acting carrying an otherwise tough script. Molly didn't really do it for me - I think Rooney Mara's acting was a little stiff but I think she's really the only knock I can give the movie acting wise.

The closing shutter transitions felt a little unnecessary. I get that it was trying to invoke an older era of film making, but it really stood out in contrast to the rest of the film's clean, digital look. It didn't feel coherent at all. Like you can't just throw in old-style transitions like that and say the job's done. If they were trying to harken the entire movie back to 40's, they did a pretty terrible job imo (although I may be missing some things, I'm not a film studies person at all or anything). I really hope the black and white cut fixes some of this.

As I mentioned above, the movie was also pretty predictable. I guess that's not necessarily a bad thing, but I think I prefer to be surprised. I knew as soon as Bradley Cooper hid behind the cages of chickens that he would become a geek by the end of the movie. I also guessed the ending line pretty early on too, but I guess it was a satisfying end.

Also, not sure if anyone else picked up on this but some of the camera shots were really offputting. There was something really unnatural in the way that a few character's heads were bobbing in several close ups. At one point I honestly started to wonder if they were using heavy facial animations, and not in a good way.",ri7edd
hovb5zz,"I liked this but I was still a little disappointed. This movie is 40 minutes longer than the 1947 version and you really feel that extra run time. On top of that, the original felt like a much more focused film that was really trying to play as a critique on religion and this movie mostly dropped that theme, but there are still some vestigial remnants in the story that just feel underdeveloped. I also don't think the remake handles the tonal shift near the end as well as the original did. 

On the positive side, I thought the set design was really good. The carnival felt dirty, the fun house was creepy, and Cate Blanchett's office felt big and expensive. Willem Dafoe was tremendous in his relatively small role. He really felt like a sleezey old-timey carnival barker. I also thought the ending really improved on the original. In the 1947 version it felt like it sort of cops out for the happy Hollywood ending. This one is dark and depressing and Bradley Cooper's performance in that scene was haunting.",ri7edd

hpluple,"Seeing a lot of comments saying that the ending is hugely telegraphed, presumably by the scene between Cooper and Dafoe after the first Geek is dropped off, but for my part I think it enhances the ending. It would be one thing if Stanton is blindsided by the geek job at the end, and if we actually saw him in the role I think that would be a detriment. But as that offer is given, he knows exactly what job it’s gonna be and that wouldn’t be the case if it weren’t signposted ahead of time",ri7edd
hp9773n,"The best things about this movie in my opinion are both Cooper’s acting and the writing for Stanton.

Throughout the film you constantly want to like Carlisle until you remember how absolutely terrible of a person he is. The con man character manages to con you throughout the entire movie. What makes the role even more fulfilling are the not so subtle, stereotypical gaslight lines Carlisle will pull throughout, and they are delivered so well that it takes just a second for the true intention to click. A great example of this is when he is chasing Molly into the men’s bathroom trying to convince her to help him and he says “please dont leave me like everyone else” or something along those lines. Gaslighting 101, but the scene is crafted so well and Bradley Cooper does such a great job that for a second you think this is a romantic moment, only to realize it’s typical manipulation that Carlisle has been pulling on customers the entire time, now just expanded towards those he “loves”.",ri7edd

hova2rh,"For anyone who's seen the original, how does del Toro's version stack up?",ri7edd
hov9khl,"I thought this movie was pretty interesting. Del Toro doesn't *always* do it for me so I was prepared for this to be well acted but shallow, but ended up walking out with quite a bit to chew on. Honestly, though, I probably would have enjoyed watching a cast like this do just about anything.

The setup for the plot takes its time, which is both nice and maybe a little unnecessary. As far as the plot goes, there's lots of interesting characters and themes to think about, but where it's all going is very clearly laid out for us. From the explanation of how to turn someone into a ""geek"" to the professor telling Stanton exactly what happens to people who misuse the con to the tarot cards, we are well aware that this is all leading to Cooper's demise at the hands of his own hubris. Even the IMDB summary of the movie spoils the ultimate twist that Blanchett was in control the whole time. 

That said, watching it get there is pretty neat. This isn't an especially humorous movie, it's actually very moody and at times melodramatic. But what it lacks in humor it makes up for in an interesting main character. Basically, you've got a guy who thinks he's the smartest person in the room at all times. He thinks he hides his past well, he thinks he can read others so well, but as the movie tells us he's as desperate to tell people who he is as they are to tell him. He thinks he's different from the preachers when he's just as bad. He thinks he hides his sins well, but Toni knows what he did to the professor. He thinks he's always in control, but as we find out he's the most easily manipulated. That's why he was ""born to be the geek.""

Blanchett played him just like Dafoe plays the alcoholics. She offered him an opportunity, temporary of course. Make a few bucks and move on. She made him feel vulnerable with her evil powers of psychology. She hooked him on the booze and made him feel in control by sleeping with him. All until he finally broke and hurt someone as she wanted him to, and she did all this despite everyone in his life telling him it was going to happen if he kept doing spook shows and manipulating people. And this whole time the eyes of every character are on him and none are on her. 

Anyways, enjoyed this. 7/10 for me. It's a bit longer than it needs to be and it's not very subtle, but the characters and themes were on point. And let's be real, a moody melodrama with this kind of budget just doesn't come around every day. It's worth enjoying when it does.

My favorite scene has to be when Molly played the part of deceased wife and Grindle is like who the fuck are you?! And of course the ending.

hp1p4gu,"Pleasant enough, competent enough, never dull in any given scene, but never really comes together for me narratively. 

The performances are all solid but there's not much spin put on the EXTREMELY predictable plotting.

I've never loved any of Del Toro's films but there's nothing about this one that I think will stick with me like certain parts of, say, SoW or Pan did. Somewhere between a director for hire and ""A Guillermo Del Toro"" movie for me.

I almost feel bad because there's a lot of solid shots in this, great costume/set design.

I just read other comments observing the last line is different in the book (""I was *made* for this"" rather than the movie's ultimate line ""I was *born* for this""), and oddly enough while running this morning I listened to Marc Maron's podcast interview with del Toro where the director talks about how there are circles throughout the film in design and background elements, and how it all connects to the 360 Stanton does with the gimp.

It gets pretty heady-- the narrative focuses on grifters and cons, and how people want to believe in the supernatural and that want is used to exploit them (us), but there's simultaneously this notion of fate that underlies all the worldly cynicism. Yet another reminder why Guillermo del Toro is my favorite working director, as if I needed one! Dude isn't just passionate, he's also meticulous with fleshing out his ideas. What a master.

NA is lengthy, and I was kinda tired seeing it so I had a hard time in the middle, but that said I don't think it was too long per se, my being tired is on me.

However, I think if you've liked Del Toro's previous stuff, then you'll definitely like this. I think the style and sets of the movie really sell that noir feel. While I've seen people say Del Toro is often style over substance, I think the style definitely elevated the movie here. Lots of foreshadowing and symbolism at play that's fun to think back on once you've seen the whole movie. I thought everyone in the movie was great but Cooper and Defoe really stand out to me, especially one of Cooper's scenes towards the end (I'm sure you know the one I'm talking about). I agree with other people that the movie feels long. And it kind of is at 2hrs 20mins but honestly it felt longer than that. Idk if it was the pacing or the fact that the movie feels like it's covering so much ground or both. Not many redeemable characters in this movie and it does make it hard to watch at times.

-Lilith’s name in reference to the biblical first wife of Adam. I feel like she absolutely represents the equal and independent female evil to Stan.

Book of Enoch is an ancient Hebrew religious text not included in the Bible. From what I understand one of the main gists of the Book of Enoch is that Enoch sees everything and conveys a message that if God is willing and able to tear apart an angel, man should be terrified of God and never doubt his absolute power. It also warns that God will execute his judgement on all the evil and ungodly ones. We can see this play out throughout Nightmare Alley. Enoch has that third eye, signifying he is a watcher of sorts—he sees all. Also: Didn't he tear apart his mother at birth? And isn't he himself (baby in the jar version) sewn up as if he was torn in part as well? Interesting parallels... Judgement was definitely executed on Bardley Cooper's character for meddling in the dark arts and lying to and defrauding people. So there's that as well. Would love to hear others' thoughts on this!

hpu35ce,"I really enjoyed this movie! After seeing the original, I think Del Toro did a great job at making the movie his own. He certainly also nailed the ending too. 

What do ya'll think of the overall messaging of the film? So I'm someone who definitely does believe in tarot cards and psychics. I totally believe that there are a lot of things in this world that we don't fully understand. That being said, I think it is important to have some level of skepticism when it comes to things like this. Stanton does a great job of manipulating people and telling them things that will comfort them as opposed to speaking the truth. 

The time period is also so important to this. Just 10 years ago the great depression was happening and now they're being plunged into world war 2. People need hope and comfort and they always turn to things they don't really understand, like some loud voices in religion, certain political parties, and yes even psychics and fortune tellers. 

I've noticed that in our own hard times, people have reverted back to these same things again. There certainly is an increased focus on spirituality, astrology, mysticism, and other things as well since the pandemic started. There's nothing wrong with believing in any of this, but I hope people are smart with who they trust. 

This is turning into a rant now but this movie was very very timely. I wish more people would watch it. It's such biting commentary. I know for the original version, it was a flop at the box office too because I don't think people wanted to be faced with the fact that some of these figures aren't very trustworthy.

hq2exi6,"this was my favorite movie of the year. However , did anyone else think about how the deeper meaning of the baby in the specimen jar was to show the genuine horrors of man?  And the lengths they will go to to make money. 

In the 1940s of  course a woman would die giving birth to a baby that big 

Without its mother 

Grown men killed an innocent baby due to it being “big as a calf”  and then stitched a cow eye up, placed it in a specimen jar, and then went on to charge  people to see the child peddling this tale. 

I’ve seen online and people only recognizing the  parallels with Stanton’s headband, but, because of the understanding of how that child came to be, I feel the child serves more as a warning to Stanton  and to the audience.

Because no one has the power to have a third eye.

Not even a therapist 

Otherwise if I was Lilith, I wouldn’t have picked up a client like that!

Also wanted to note, did anyone else pick up on the fact that Stanton had so little money because she was charging him for every time they met? Due to her being his therapist? And that she essentially used him to kill off her most troublesome clients, the ones, like him, she realized were beyond her help.

hq9g9ix,"Just seen this movie tonight, absolutely stunning visually! Especially the second half of the movie. I would say up until the point when the murder-suicide scene happened I was finding it to move a little too slow and wasn’t sure where the storyline was going.

I missed the first couple of minutes of the movie and later found out that Bradley Coopers character burned his house down (and I think it involved the dads dead body) which I think if I had seen would have changed my perspective on the movie a little bit. 

Surprised some people didn’t associate Lilith’s chest scar with Jenkins, that was my first/only thought as to why the scar reveal was relevant. Once Stan took the first drink of alcohol in her office I had a feeling it was going to be the beginning of a major downfall for him. I noticed he didn’t wince or move when he tasted it which made me wonder if he had a drinking problem in the past but overcame it? 

Anyways I ended up really enjoying the movie. Great casting, wardrobe, cinematography, and locations (how especially gorgeous was Liliths office!) . Cate and Willem were perfection. Slightly predictable at times (when Clem shows Stan the boxes of alcohol I knew he was going to poison someone, though for a second I thought he would take pity on the Geek and use the wood alcohol to kill off Clem) I just wish it had moved at a quicker pace for the first half or even 2/3 of the movie.

hvjd562,"I'm a huge fan of the first film. I think Cooper did extremely well in the role however Tyrone Power was absolute aces in the 1947 version and looked the part a wee bit more. A fun fact is that Tyrone named his plane The Geek. And for those who don't know, Anton LaVey, who was also a carny and perceived to have played the long con, modeled some of his life off the novel/original as well. So much so that his daughter's name is Zeena. Guillermo made this version cinematically beautiful to behold. Slightly off topic, being a gamer nerd myself, the second we find Stan in Lilith's office the atmosphere looked like a scene straight out of BioShock. I know the previous film adaptation was scrapped years ago but if anyone could resurrect it Del Toro would be a shoe in.
All in all I loved it. It makes me really miss HBO's Carnivàle. It's like that old saying goes, "" they got the face they deserved."" Stan is no longer a human being.

I took this as a subtle reference to calling him a geek.  Do you think Clem intended to see if Stan would geek early on?  It seemed as if he was testing him when he was showing him the difference between the wood alcohol and regular alcohol to see if he was prone to drinking.  He almost looked disappointed when Stan says he never touches the stuff.

The rest of it is definitely noir with a punch gut in the end where it might be Bradley Cooper's finest acting moment since Wet Hot American Summer. 

The only issue I had was the first act being too long with the carnival stuff. We watched every carnie show, when it could have been a montage. When it gets to Buffalo (it was cool seeing Buffalo being used with the art deco buildings), it really takes off, which reminded me of The Prestige in a weird way with mind tricks in trying to outwit someone. 

The violence in Del Toro movies always feels impactful, I don't know how he does it, but the violence always felt visceral to me when watching his films.

It struck me how the more powerful he felt the more he would allow himself to consume alcohol because it made him feel like he was in control of it unlike his father. 

It wasn't so much the alcohol it self but the memories of his father being abusive and the weakness he associated with it that triggered him everytime he would even smell it.

hvc233f,"I really enjoyed *Nightmare Alley* as a whole (even though it had a couple of weaker moments), so much so that I even bought myself the fancy artbook/making-of companion book (*Nightmare Alley: The Rise and Fall of Stanton Carlisle).* And damn, there is just so much stuff that was cut out from the final film - it was apparently supposed to be over 3 hours long!

The book actually shows plenty of these cut scenes/plot points, but treats them as if they were still a part of the final product. Maybe Del Toro changed his mind at the last possible moment? Who knows. For example, Dafoe's character was apparently much more fleshed out - they mention him having a pregnant wife (played by Lara Jean Chorostecki, who I don't think appears even for one scene in the final film) whose miscarriage was apparently an important moment (the book even includes a photo showing Dafoe's character holding his stillborn baby's corpse + a quote from Dafoe himself about the scene's impact). There is also an interesting diner scene, or an entire missing part about freaks of nature...

\~40 more minutes sounds like a lot for an already long-ish film, but it all seems like it was crafted with care and actual love for the source material. Maybe one day Del Toro (or, more specifically, the studio that owns the rights to the film) is going to release this longer cut on home video/streaming? I would certainly love to see it. :)",ri7edd

But what stuck out to me was the “realism.” I knew going into this one that it was a regular noir. However, because of Del Toro previous works, Pan’s Labyrinth and The Shape of Water, there were several moments I was expecting the movie to dive into supernatural elements, or perhaps used some psychological horror. Alas that wasn’t the case. But I feel the direction wanted to go that way. 

Still like it a lot. Feel sorry for Cooper’s character because it seemed he was a victim of circumstances. Then it was revealed he killed his father and was a dick all along. So the ending felt gratifying.",ri7edd

I knew nothing about the movie going into it, and by the halfway point I was still having a hard time understanding what the movie was even about.

The main character isnt a great person, but hes not a horrible person either, and I feel like he doesnt deserve what happens to him by the end.

But mostly, it was just depressing. The movie felt kind of pointless and in general pretty miserable.

hsrpqor,"Anyone else draw the line between Grindle and George Hodel? There were a lot of abortion references made in this film, and I don’t recall learning how Grindle made his fortune. 

George Hodel was a successful Los Angeles doctor known for discreetly treating celebrities for venereal diseases and performing illegal abortions on the side. He also widely believed to be the killer of the Black Dahlia. 

My take away was that Grindle was a Hodel type character that performed illegal abortions and in the process sometimes intentionally or unintentionally murdered the woman in the process. 

The constant showing of the fetuses in jars, the direct reference to Doree dying during an abortion, the scar on the doctor’s abdomen, and the admission that he hurt so many young women all point to this scenario, in my opinion.

ETA: I was not aware that this was a remake! Coincidentally, the Black Dahlia was found in January of 1947 and the original Nightmare Alley film was released in October of 1947.  That timeline makes the George Hodel resemblances coincidental, I think. I don’t think that it was widely known what Hodel was up to for many many years after his death. He was suspected of other murders, so i suppose it’s possible that it was a well kept secret in Hollywood and that this film was indeed a reference to him, but the timeline for the Dahlia murder and the release of the film seems too tight, not to mention that the novel was published in 1946.",ri7edd

The con artist gets greedy and ends up being the victim in the end and you knew he would become the geek in the end.  And its a nearly 3 hr long movie for such a basic script.

You knew the monologue was the end, you literally knew every plot point.  Don’t the spook trick, don’t read this book, stop while you’re ahead, stay away from Grindle, hes crazy, yep shit going to go wrong.  

Someone said predictable doesn’t mean bad, yes true but when you know every single plot point for a thriller before it happens, it kills the fun especially when its super long.  

And then you have a weak one dimensional character in Rooney that felt like it was from an older film (same plot as original i know) and it just doesn’t fly with 2021 writing standards

There is nothing positive that I could say that other people haven't already said better than I could. The only odd thing to me was that Bradley's character felt too much like a videogame protagonist during the first part, going where other people told him to go, speaking as little as possible, and feeling lke he was just standing there waiting for the cutscene to end when people where talking, when Dafoe gave him the flashlight it almost felt like a ""press x to turn on the light"" would pop up, but that completely change in the second half making him a way different and interesting character but still under a believable progression.

Edit: Forgot to mention it, but something I did not like was the whole plan of having Molly as the wife. It was obvious everything would go wrong there, being that the dude wasn't going to just stop and pray one of them. It would have been way easier to just have Molly behind the locked gate, after making sure he didn't had any key on him.

howh5f0,"I had a pretty good day at the movies today. Saw No Way Home twice, then ended the night with this (triple Dafoe!). All in all, I spent a good 8 hours at the theater, about the same shift as the workers there.

Overall, I liked this movie, although I think I may have been a little emotionally drained from my back to back screenings of Spider-Man because I did feel the length of this and the pacing seemed a bit uneven. I also purposely went into it blind, just as a fan of Guillermo del Toro and film noir. I had no idea of its source material or the 1947 adaptation, nor whether it contained any supernatural elements (although sideshow attractions are always appealing on film). I was definitely drawn into the drama and deception, though I somehow thought it would end up being more ""revelatory"" than it was. All the flashbacks to his sick father in bed, the house being set on fire, the watch ticking and the psychiatrist's line of questioning and analysis felt like it was leading specifically towards some kind of twist (*à la* Shutter Island), and the ending somewhat disappointed my expectations. It wasn't until I read the first paragraph of the Wikipedia plot summary that I finally understood the circular nature of the film and really appreciated it for what it was.

>Stan is disturbed at how any man could sink to the level of performing as a geek, living in a cage in squalor and biting off the heads of live chickens to appease the crowd. Clem explains that he seeks out alcoholic or drug-addicted men with troubled pasts, and lures them in with promises of a ""temporary"" job and opium-laced alcohol. He then uses their dependence to physically and mentally abuse them until they sink into madness and depravity, thus creating a new geek.",ri7edd
hp6n9vs,"I love the circus. I love Guillermo Del Toro. I should've been primed to enjoy this film much more than actually did.  


Two things are missing that every film needs: Doug Jones & and Plot.  


By the time the dramatic question and plot mechanics started moving and forming, it was already well into the movie and I rather too late for these developments to be happening. Thankfully, every single department was on it's A-game, so I still enjoyed my theatre experience, just a little let down is all.",ri7edd
hvnkh4d,"The performances were great. The movie is beautiful to look at. But, on the whole, I found it very meandering. I enjoyed both halves of the movie as separate entities but when put together they just don't jive with one another. It's a predictable outcome for Stan but the slow burn of the film makes it very hard to get through. And, unfortunately, I just don't see the character of Stan from the beginning being that guy towards the end of the movie. He's obviously a traumatized man by the time he gets to Clem's carnival and, somehow, he becomes a fantastic showman mentalist in a brief window of time... Cooper sells the performance but the character transition just isn't believable for me. 

And there are many details in the movie that just don't really pan out to be anything... Stan's relationship to Zeena, the mixing up of the alcohol, Clem's warning about fucking with him and towing the line, just a lot of needless detail that could've been cut out to speed up the pace of the film a bit.

What I see happening in this movie is a big complaint I've had of Tarantino's last few movies and Andy Muschietti in *IT: Chapter 2* : they are allowed to do just too much. It's like Del Toro took no advice from his editor. It's like some directors win their Oscars and they're given entirely too much leeway in what goes into the final cut of the movie. 

I can't help but think of how much better this movie could've been with some restraint in the needless moments that made into the final cut. I wanted to like this movie a lot more than I actually did. Personally, I think if he could've stuck to the first half and melded the second half into the carnival but, it would've been a lot better. But there's just too much disparity between the two halves.",ri7edd

hst4j7n,"I thought it was okay. The trailer and critic reviews hyped it up more than I think it needed to be.

I didn't like the pacing. This movie should not have been 2.5 hours long. The carnival part dragged on. The conflict and tension should have been more focused and tightened. The final act where it's revealed that Cate Blanchett was conning Stan, was almost too out of left field. The Grindle swindle should have been the main focus of the story in my opinion, but the film wasted too much time on other plots/scenes. 

The noir aspect felt inconsistent. It was only really prevalent during the Cate and Bradley scenes.

I didn't know it was a remake of a 1940s movie. It felt like it was trying too hard to stick to that and its pacing. 

However, I did like the surprise ending, the lighting/style and the acting. Bradley Cooper and Willem Defoe did really well. Cooper is almost 50 years old but really came across as a young man. Compare Defoe's carnival owner portrayal to the last guy and you can really see the difference.",ri7edd

hqhr62a,"I read the book and watched the 1947 movie before going.  The 1947 movie is a pretty close adaptation except for cutting out the phase where Stan becomes the leader of a spiritualist church.  I thought it was unwise to cut that out because he hits the big time with that which makes his fall even more dramatic.  The new film actually follows the plot progression of the previous film more than the book and also cuts that out.  It adds some details about Stan's home life that were left out of the previous movie.

At any rate, given how closely it adheres to the previous adaptation, I'm unsure why it had to be made.  It's an okay movie, and as someone who considers *The Shape of Water* to be one of the worst wide-release movies of the past decade at least and also did not like del Toro's last bunch of movies, this is probably his best since the (somewhat overrated) *Pan's Labyrinth*.

The only scenes I can, off hand, think to cut/trim would be Bruno and The Major scenes (Ron Perlman and Mark Povinelli) but...like... those are great scenes! How do you cut those two? 

Their scenes, imo, don't pay off as well as the other plotlines and the run time could have been used to develop in the stronger areas. But, like,  wow. Really great film. I think the movie will certainly pay off on a second watch very well. Maybe not Shudder Island levels but similar pick ups and second viewing rewards. Really rich, beautiful design. But maybe a touch too indulgent and *rich* in that aspect which slows the film down. But like, hell of a ride, looking forward to my second watch.",ri7edd

I generally like Guillermo del Toro's work, and that surreal aesthetic he brings to all his projects, and I'm a Bradley Cooper fan, so I was cautiously optimistic.

We went to the local Cinemark theater, and I was a little disappointed that the film was playing on one of their smaller screens. We still had the nice leather power-recliners, and the sound system was suitable for the theater, but I prefer a ginormous screen when I pay to go see a movie. Anyway...

The pace and rhythm of this movie was odd. You never really knew where it was going, all the way up til the end, which I suppose was the point. I liked the film, and was pleased that I didn't anticipate the ending. Visually, it's a beautiful movie featuring the sort of nuanced technical mastery that is a del Toro trademark. The story is focused and efficient, and the ending is tidy and satisfying.

All in all, I give it a 7/10.",ri7edd

To everyone calling this (crime) noir, I just want to say that there must be something wrong with me.

I thought it was more like slice-of-life, until we focused on Richard Jenkins, with the distinct look of a horror movie.

It might have something to do with the first act reminding me of Adventureland, and I didn't think we'd end up focusing on a single mark, and it (maybe) could've been interesting if we didn't.

Anyway, the story wasn't all the way there for me, but everything else was excellent. I'd never seen Rooney Mara play a role like that before, and hopefully she gets some notice for it.

Del Toro built a beautiful world, but at no point did I want to stay in it for a second longer than I needed to. Even his fancy hotel room felt seedy and stuffy. I think a montage or two would have alleviated the visual claustrophobia.

Did Ezra Grindle give Dr Lillith the scar on her chest, and if so did she then use the information she had from the psych sessions to scout out a ""medium"" that she knows has fallen into believing he can manipulate anyone. She knows that he had previously seen other ""mediums"" which didn't end well as she warned Stan. She had been seen in the crowd of Stan's shows before and then broke him down from there. She set it up from the very beginning, she didn't need the money, she wanted to take out Grindle but have her hands clean, which compared with the scene at the end where Stan is washing his hands in her sink, he's the one with blood on his hands and she has no place in the murder. 

&#x200B;

hvav8gi,"Late to the discussion but finally saw it in my country.

The criticisms of it being predictable or uncharacteristic turns of character surprise me because to me that almost felt like the point. I can understand that you want a twist but I almost feel like that's something we almost come to expect and instead seeing the character we know to inevitable decisions because of his past is satisfying in its own way.

I thought the film was a pretty good reflection of the American mythos and the reality of it. I'm reminded of this scene from 'The Wire' where D'Angelo gives his interpretation of Fitzgerald and his quote that ""there are no second acts in American life."" (https://youtu.be/cKlGQfvj5_g) He explains thay the past is always with us and even though we can try to reinvent ourselves, we can never escape our pasts. In that way, Stan is given multiple opportunities to escape his past and also not be like his father, but in D'Angelo's words, that shit caught up with him. He makes every mistake that we knew he would to the point that you almost want to scream at him. Stan uses an American penchant, I believe, to believe in a sort of mysticism and religion (see using religion against the sheriff to get out of trouble) on his marks, and in the end that comes back to bite him in the ass. Not only because he buys his own bullshit, but because there's another bigger dog out there to eat you as well. The only way to get out is to say no, like Molly (although how you do that in real life, I'm not sure).

In any case, loved the movie. Although I agree that the movie felt 30 minutes too long, in the face of TV shows these days that are 10 hour-long episodes for characters or subplots or whatever, I appreciate this movie for taking the time to talk about somewhat insignificant characters and wrap up everything in one movie.",ri7edd

I guess the motivation(s) of some characters. I don't know, *something* i can't put my finger on.

Then i found the third act to come so sudden and maybe my perspective was distorted because of how it felt long or because it was actually just too sudden.

I told my mom it felt somewhat tedious at times and though it had specific GREAT moments and that ending just gave it a few points, it was rather disappointing. That final laugh was amazing. I didn't see the conclusion of ""him becoming the geek at the end"" soon though my family did so in that aspect It's my fault (which became positive cause I didn't expect the ending until he went to ask for a job and the acting shocked me).

It seemed he was fascinated with her, but was there any practical reason to let her in on his scam?

It also didn't really make sense to me that he went to such lengths with Grindle. He painted himself into a corner, which he should have been smart enough not to do. I suppose he was blinded by greed and his feelings for Lilith? As a talented performer, it seems like he could have gone on to play larger audiences and led a rich life. It didn't make sense to me that he would do this swindle that was inevitably going to end with him being on the run. Maybe he was already on the run for killing his dad or some other crime.

And the star power is off the charts.  Bradley Cooper, Willem Dafoe, Cate Blanchett, Ron Perlman, and the list goes on.

I terms of filmmaking, it's fabulous.  But....

But.....

Ugh. There's really nobody to like. The main character (Bradley Cooper) is clearly a sociopath. And he's not really a fun sociopath. He's a schemer. He has no boundaries. 

And the movie didn't serve up a single surprise. They foreshadowed the alcohol poisoning, and delivered it like 2 scenes later. They foreshadowed the ending as clear as day. Basically, if you saw a scene where people were talking, they were foreshadowing a later scene where the things they said would then happen. Sometimes, it was 2 minutes later. Sometimes, it took an hour. But, nearly every scrap of dialog was simply them telling us what was coming. 

This movie got nominated for Oscar's for production design, costumes, and cinematography. And I totally agree! 

It also got nominated for best picture and I couldn't disagree more. The writing was lazy.

And in the end, we see Stan get what he basically deserves. And who cares? I didn't. I saw it coming. It wasn't irony. It wasn't justice. It was just the shitty world of shitty people who do shitty stuff to each other. Bleh. 

It's a Tiffany box stuffed with a dirty diaper.",ri7edd
i2y58vt,"Finally got around to seeing this. In the opening shot where cooper drags the body from out of frame lower left to upper right while framing the hole beyond and setting up the next shot, I knew I was in for a well composed movie.

A couple questions and observations I have:

-Cooper intentionally kills Pete does he not? or was it his arrogance to grab the wrong alcohol and when he acted like he was listening to the lesson of Dafoe talking about the drinking vs. functional alcohol he actually didn’t regard the dialogue as important and therefore didn’t hear the details as most people do when they find your conversation uninteresting. 

-In a biblical context I believe Lilith is only mentioned briefly and is either a deceiver, seducer of men, or something along those lines which I think is fitting with her character.

-Enoch is said to have killed his mother at birth and that his eye “follows you like the paintings”. I took enoch as the omnipresent eye of witness, or of judgement and that he always saw your capability for darkness. Also Grindle’s woman was killed potentially as a result of her being pregnant and therefore a liability for Grindle. So the son (Grindles son) killed his mother in this way which parallels with Enoch’s description by Dafoe. Biblically, I think Enoch is the scribe of judgment as well. A stretch but interesting to me.

-The scar on Lillith and Enoch also seemed similar in their vertical orientation, “roughness/undulation”, and possibly the purpose Made me think that perhaps Grindle was the one who aborted the baby and that her (the mother) being his first violent attack on a woman that we know of, set up his pattern of hurting women in the future and led him to attack that region of Lillith because he associates that area with his pain or whatever he feels.

-Last question, why are the floor boards of the house removed in the opening scene? we see later the floor is intact in the flash back. Did cooper recover items from under the floor or was he “burying” his father and his shame within the foundation of the house where he was abused? It seemed like a lot of work to pull up the floor if you were going to burn it all down and not hide the body under the floor…

Curious to hear your thoughts! Thanks!",ri7edd
i3pr1q1,"I watched this last night, like a few people, unaware that it was a remake.  
I didn't hate it, but I think I was mostly bothered by the genre it claims. This is not even close to what I would call a psychological thriller, in-fact, most if not all of the plot points are laid bare as they happen, I never found myself wondering ""what's going on here"" for more than a few minutes, and when I did, it wasn't because of some tricky mental gymnastics. 

I agree with others that this FEELS like a really long movie, pacing is quite bad, with so many scenes that seemingly go nowhere and contribute nothing to the ending. Character development left a lot to be desired also, characters seem to shift and change as the plot needs them to, without any natural lead-up or inclination towards it.

The ending, while a nice full-circle, felt rushed, like we're supposed to believe that this guy couldn't just haul lumber or something? He just gives up as soon as his first offer is rejected, this protagonist who was willing to go as far as to murder, lie and cheat to get success? I don't buy it.

And what was Lilith's game here exactly? The assumption being she was using Stan to deal with her past clients/enemies. The problem with that is regardless of how well she can read people, surely there is no way she could know exactly how events would unfold to anticipate the Judge and his wife being a murder suicide, and Ezra and his bodyguard being murdered by Stanton. It was like things went wrong in a perfectly unpredictable manner and the villain is just like ""hahaha see, exactly as I planned it, I've been fooling you all along"" the payoff felt unearned, and let's not even touch on the 'he's fine with alcohol now...Because'.

From what I hear, the original was a bit more focused and better paced. Still, I think it's definitely worth watching. But Guillermo has done much, much better.",ri7edd
hvspnow,"hear me out....I agree with mostly everything said in here and love all the brilliant comments, fantastic movie.     Spoilers. So does anyone think it’s possible that the geek in the beginning was him all along and the movie is just the geek getting help/therapy...telling the story of how he ended up there. They dropped him off in that town, he was concussed, fever, on heroin, and alcohol. He is in therapy imagining himself as cooper, telling the story in therapy, of how he fell apart and ended up as the geek. Plus the cyclical nature of addiction, he may not even be able to think and feel anything other than replaying in his head the movie of  “what went wrong and how did I end up here” this is how he imagines it. Over and over again. Please does this make sense to anyone else, I know I’m using terrible grammar.",ri7edd

Anyone can righteously declare that they aren’t like the other, but given circumstances any of us could slowly slide into the very position that we condemn and are fighting against.

I have read a few comments about how brilliant the ending and all of it is, but I just think I am missing something about Carnival culture or even the style of the movie becase I just don't see it. 

It felt like a movie were a lot happens to fast taking away its impact. AT first I was waiting for Stanton to be about something more. It felt as if he just vaguely wondered into carnival life and kept running with it. It felt vague because I was at first expecting him to reveal more, or to have some deeper secret, but no. He just unemotionally started the job and sort of put in with everyone.

When he fell in love with Molly and all the things happened it felt as if he was not emotionally super involved. Even falling in love and leaving the carnival with her felt a little superficial.

The last act with him being more of a professional mentalist also felt a little short to me. Establishing them as performers did not seem real and then how they met and interacted with the the Doctor also felt a little confusing and forced.

I guess the movie was not for me. It did not really catch my attention and I just didn't feel that click from the narrative. It felt confusing and superficial although pretty. I felt a lot of the famous actors were there only to play a small part, but in a certain way the made me feel they were there for something bigger as many are usually bigger name actors.

The ending itself, I guessed it when I saw him in the scene, not before, but I also didn't to get the significance. Why was he born to play the geek? Because he was miserable? He did it to himself and only at the end did he barely show any feeling about it.",ri7edd

hpcsftc,"I’m glad I’m not alone in this. The movie looked nice. It sounded nice. But so much didn’t add up. So many scenes were just added runtime. Him drinking comes from nowhere despite how pivotal of a character moment it should be it’s completely glossed over. The fact that he loves Molly and they run away together, and the very next scene (2 years later) he’s treating her like trash. The predictability of Cate double crossing him. So much BS in this film ruined any kind of experience I was hoping for. And yes. What was the point. Bad guy ignores people to do bad things and gets what he deserves. Okay. Cool, I guess.",ri7edd
hplmac9,"I think the disjointedness is a result of del Toro cherry picking what he liked about the book and superimposing his own narrative ideas over it. 

To shed some light on the relationship between Molly and Stan. Stan didn’t pine for her in the books the way he did in the movie. He had a relationship with the fortune teller that was more fitting for his character, but that was skipped in the movie. Stan overlooks Molly until he saves her from getting arrested and she throws herself at him in gratitude. This is significant because his betrayal makes more sense in the context of the fact that he never really loved her in the first place. Him falling out of love with her in the movie doesn’t make as much sense because I think del Toro just umbrella’d that shift under Stan’s overall character arc so you don’t really see a *reason* for Stan to go from adoring her to not giving a shit about her.",ri7edd
hunlg22,"I honestly could have done without the dad subplot (the fire, killing him) and all that. It felt pretty pointless outside of padding minutes and the thing with the watch -- which honestly would have worked fine as an intro to mentalism and did not require a whole dedicated B-plot. 

If anything, it just weakens the story IMO. Without the backstory, Stan is just a clean slate audience stand-in nice guy but whose downfall is hubris. With the dad subplot, Stan looses relatability because you know from the start that he murdered someone. It also attributes a lot of his downfall at the end to a genetic predisposition to drink, which is just not it.",ri7edd
hq7vont,"I'm surprised people felt this way, I'm not usually the type to pick up on subtle themes so I thought this one was pretty obvious.  The ""point"" is a warning about becoming to prideful and full of yourself, like Icarus flying too close to the sun.  It isn't just that he ""fucks up and then pays in a terrible way"" its that he makes a series of very bad choices because he thinks he's better then everyone around him, and then pays in a pretty terrible way.

He starts doing the medium act because he gets too full of himself and thinks he's better then his mentor who told him not to.  He starts drinking because he want to show Dr. Ritter (and probably himself) that he can do anything and that he's better his father. He shouts at Molly because he thinks he's better then her and she's holding him back. He tries to con the last guy even after Dr. Ritter's warning (and leaves the money with her) because he thinks he will always be in control. He even says when he leaves the carnival that he's to good for it and the people there.

They pretty much lay it out early in the film when the older magician guy who teaches Stanton tells him about the ""shuteye"".  He started believing his own bullshit and it destroyed him.",ri7edd
hv3vp55,"A little late, but I agreed after I watched it initially. For me, it felt a little pointless because I was frustrated with whom I wanted to succeed (Stan). However the only real protagonist in the movie is Molly, and that's what I love about it. I went into it knowing almost nothing, and that's probably what threw me off.

hvoyx5h,"I've been thinking, and I think it's because you don't care for much of the film. Like, imagine you'd seen the same 'plot' but for characters you really care about. That ending would be very tragic, what happened to Rooney Mara would be very sad, what happened to Blanchett is tragic and in turn terrifying, ditto Richard Jenkins.

But you don't care, so these things happened, you figure that makes sense, and that's that. But also because of some obfuscations you didn't know stuff like the Blanchett twist, because it's hard to quantify other than ""she betrayed him.""

She took his money, but she didn't 'take it,' she didn't ruin any of his schemes, per se. She just framed him for murder, but that doesn't entirely sink in emotionally because I don't think that was exactly on the mind of viewers in their scene together right after the murder.

The random transitions felt very unmotivated, which is probably the biggest indictment of the film overall - what was the point to any of this?   


As you said - nothing in the way of character motivation, and definitely more than one contradictory character actions. It seems the actors were randomly given the note ""Pretend like you're in a 50's movie! Say stuff like 'everything's Jake!'""   


I think it was pretty predictable from the beginning where he was going to end up, particularly with Dafoe's character taking the time to explain everything.

And in reality him doing that was all part of her toying with him and led to his ultimate downfall: him becoming a geek and an alcoholic just like his father and all the people he once resented or looked down on.

Guillermo’s was more of a portrayal of what humanity can be at it’s absolute worst. Like the monsters that are usually the villains of his film got to be the focus, whereas Rooney Mara’s character would typically be the protagonist of his.

I'd say the scene where they leave the geek at the hospital and him sitting with Clem as he gets told how he breaks them ending with his offering of ""poor soul"" shows how the movie *doesn't* do a good job of informing us of a characters feelings/motivations, and the using these scenes effectively to setup future scenarios.

We see Stan attempt to dissociate from his father’s identity of a failed husband, alcoholic, and generally bad person. By abstaining from drinking and marrying Molly he doesn’t rid himself of his desires, he merely suppresses them. 

I think the original author went more the direction of showing how Stan’s choices and lack of self awareness landed him in his fate as the geek, where as del Toro in my interpretation wanted to express the idea that Stan’s dark desires were there from the start.

That's also a good point about the Dr. I also think she couldn't really have planned that in that way. I was a bit confused after finishing the movie and before I read some comments here about who she was, or why she took an interest in this guy. I believe they were just both egomaniacs, that happened to cross paths, trying to show each other how ""powerful"" they are. Perhaps she did know the connection between Kimbell and Ezra, and just gave it a shot in case he would bite, and he did, then it was reasonable to expect it would end badly?

The other great question I had is how did the back story of his dad matter to the story to the extent they made it seem? They kept going back to that scene with the fire and the old man in the cold, throughout the entire movie. Ok, he had daddy issues, and we assume he's capable of killing from that scene.

>	Morgan and Del Toro changed Carlisle’s last line from “Mister, I was made for it” to “Mister, I was born for it.” For them that small change held a big significance.

>	“That one word makes a big difference there because we wanted the audience to know very clearly from the beginning that he was going to end up being the geek,” said Del Toro. “We didn’t want that to be a surprise ... what we wanted is not the what, but the how.”

hox6sbs,Yeah I took it as Grindle actually hurt her but I like that this movie doesn’t hand you all the answers. Leaves a lot to think about.,ri7edd
hqku1lb,"These are inferences, but I also get the sense that Grindle was the one that gave Dr Ritter the scar, and she weaponizes Carlisle as a disposable instrument of revenge.  To break it down into pieces (and going off of memory):

* Dr Ritter notes that Grindle is dangerous, influential, rich and private
* She also notes that he was temporarily a patient of hers
* Grindle and his bodyguard note that they've dealt with 'snake oil salesmen' in the past and that they have ways of dealing with them
* Both of them seem like violent men
* One could infer that Grindle temporarily tried out Dr Ritter's therapy as a way to process his guilt and violent impulses.  But he quickly loses patience and when the therapy doesn't give him any peace, he deemed it 'snake oil'.
* What would he do to Dr Ritter in this case?  Given his confession that he habitually hurts/abuses women, he cuts/scars Ritter as punishment for her therapy not being effective.  It would be easy to imagine him threatening to kill her if she doesn't stay quiet about it.
* He and his bodyguard similarly threaten Carlisle noting that they paid him a fortune and they're losing patience with his mentalist activities and darkly imply violent consequences if he doesn't deliver.
* Earlier on, Carlisle asks what happens if he 'fails the test' - again, the implication is that there'd be violent consequences.  So it may be that Dr Ritter got her scar because she had already 'failed the test'.  She couldn't give Grindle the relief he was after.  And he made her suffer for it.
* If we assume that Grindle was the one that hurt Dr Ritter, given her own ability to read people she dupes Carlisle into being her weapon of revenge.  She realizes he's desperate for money.  And she knows he has rage issues with older men.  Those work to her advantage.
* If she helps position him to take a job with Grindle, she knows Grindle will eventually grow impatient/dis-satisfied.  And given Carlisle's anger against older father figures, in a violent confrontation he'll harm Grindle.
* So she positions Carlisle to back himself into that corner.  She gives him a bit of information, but doesn't let him write anything down to remove any evidence of her own involvement.
* She purposely leaves her key in her cabinet so he can independently listen to her recordings of Grindle's therapy.  She's conning him into thinking he's in control of the Grindle situation (similar to the story of how to create a Geek - make them think its their choice, when you're really manipulating them).
* Carlisle ends up killing Grindle.
* From there, Ritter's focus becomes making sure she can't be tied to the crime.  So she records a portion of the final confrontation with Carlisle where the describes him as mentally unstable, and calls out that he potentially murdered another older man.  She feigns ignorance when he says they worked together.  She's setting him up to completely take the fall for Grindle's murder.
* Then either by accident (or on purpose) she wounds him rather than killing him, which works in her favor as the cops/security walk in with him trying to strangle her.  So the idea he's a mentally unstable person who killed Grindle of his own volition is cemented and Ritter's involvement is completely obscured.

In essence, Ritter sets up Carlisle as her geek.  She preys on his vulnerability, lets him think he's making his own choices, and allows him to get himself in too deep.  To get him to the point where he's willing to bite the head off a chicken.  Only the chicken in this case is Grindle.

Once she's done with Carlisle she disposes of him and disavows any involvement with him.  Similar to how Dafoe's character gets rid of his own injured Geek the moment he becomes a liability.

Interestingly enough, in the original book it notes that Carlisle's Father was physically abusive towards him (and even beat his family dog to death on the day Carlisle's mother left).  Which explains Carlisle's hatred/murder of his Father and his pent-up rage against old men in general.  Ritter sees this and uses Carlisle's anger and arrogance to her advantage.

The irony is Carlisle becomes like his Father - violent, alcoholic and someone who pushes away the woman who cared for him (Molly).  He claims he'll 'never' be like his Father.  And ends up exactly like his Father.  As he notes bitterly in the end.  He was 'born' for this.",ri7edd
hp0yqlp,"That's my read, too. She >!played him to get back at Grindle<!, she flatly states she doesn't care about money, and it's clear she doesn't need it. Stan, however, believes that money is what makes the world turn, and her >!breaking the trust and stripping the money to singles !<. I don't think she knew what Stan would ultimately do to Grindle, perhaps believed it was a serious possibility, but I think the money thing was spiteful revenge for his cruel comments at the first read.",ri7edd

hy0ddll,"So the original film did things slightly differently.

Spoilers ahead for the original 1947 film:

>!spoiler!> Zeena was faithful to Pete because she was guilty over being partially responsible for him being an alcoholic. Stanton also didn't treat Molly like shit in that film. And he goes to a psychiatrist (Ritter) because he still troubled over accidently killing Pete. Stanton doesn't have an affair with Ritter but they do work together to scam the social elites. When Molly, in the middle of ruse, refuses to continue to pretend to be Erza's dead wife, they have to flee. Ritter betrays Stanton in a similar way to this remake but without the gunshot and Stanton gives what little money he was given (from Ritter) to Molly, for her to go back to the carnival, where she can be cared for.

Pete warns him. Molly. Zeena. The doctor. All in different ways. Some vague, some direct. Doesn’t mean the movie is bad. Just a different way to tell the story. 

You can simplify most all movies like OP did if you want considering they’re usually structured the same way. I enjoyed it! Blanchett’s character was the hardest read but clearly Ezra and her had some history.

hvf5pfd,"The issue with this is that the movie never shows Stan thinking he is better then everyone else.  You can really only guess what hes thinking, and I never really got that impression.  What I got was that he wanted to live the high life as a wealthy person of luxury.  He wanted to BE an important person.  Basically the movie tells us directly in Mollys letter, ""There is a hole inside you that your trying to fill.""  Hes a hurt and broken person from a shitty childhood, and he just wants to be happy, and thinks that its money and status that will do that.  He never thought he was better then everyone (only maybe the disgusting carny life), and he never believed he could actually talk to ghosts or whatever either.  So when everything comes crashing down on him, it just feels needlessly cruel.",ri7edd
hxqz4u7,"Uncut Gems was another movie about someone getting too big for their britches and it was way more compelling.

I think a huge problem with Nightmare Alley is I never once believed that Stan believed his own bullshit.  There didn't seem to be any delusions of grandeur besides the simple idea he could con people.  The ""I think I helped their marriage"" line is maybe the closest we got, but the pacing and possibly order of the reveal of the murder-suicide hurts it on top of the fact that I don't think Stan even believed what he was saying, he was just trying to get Molly to comply.  His last speech to her when she was in the stall about how scared he was felt fake too, I really don't see what could prevent Stan and Molly from packing up and moving to a new town in the 40's.  They're carnies, they're used to being nomads, or at least Molly is.",ri7edd

hsv40dq,"Hello, I just came out of a screening and wanted to reply to your comment. Throughout the movie I felt there was an undercurrent of religious critique. Cooper's character definitely took on traits of modern-day evangelical preachers, with the high suggestibility in their performances and ability to compel extreme fervor and reactions from the people they call up, all in the name of playing to the congregation. Similar to that woman in the crowd who got called out by the fortune teller, she knew the fortune teller got some things wrong but felt pressured to play along. She also wanted to believe the fortune teller had powers.   
When Cooper went as far as providing spiritual solace to Grindle, it started to feel that he had become a minister or spiritual adviser. It all tied back to David Strathairn's character's warning to Cooper's character: lie enough, and eventually you start to believe it.",ri7edd

Ironically, the 1940s version of the movie has great examples of gaslighting. One that comes to mind is the scene where Stan goes to confront Lilith prior to his attempt to escape, and Lilith convinces Stan that he's delusional and imagining that she stole his money and that he's hallucinating the sound of approaching police sirens.

For those who don't know, gaslighting is when someone denies reality to make the observer or participant lose trust in their own mental fortitude and ability to perceive reality rationally. It makes them feel like they're crazy for imagining scenarios that didn't happen, or seeing / hearing things that aren't there.

Examples: 

""Why are you upset?"" ""What do you mean? You told me that you cheated on me yesterday, of course I'm upset!"" ""What are you talking about? No I didn't. You must be having a nervous breakdown again and imagining things. Go lay down.""

He wouldn’t budge. The studio’s reasoning was that the then recent Watchman failed at the box office, and they figured this movie would be exactly the same. They had pre-vis already done for the plane crash, Big Daddy concepts made, and certain sets built. It’s still being talked about, there was a big article published last year interviewing him about it. He was and still is super passionate about the game, which is all the more frustrating. 

A Cure for Wellness is what his Bioshock movie turned into. They even used some unused sets. The story is *very* similar to Bioshock where a young man is cast into this very unfamiliar isolated yet fancy environment where a man controls everything because he has access to eels that provide powers to those who consume their essence. The essence is refined into an extract that can only be made with people’s bodies. It’s all there. There’s even a grotto set in the movie that you can tell is the exact same grotto that Atlas lost his family in in the game. 

So yeah, A Cure for Wellness is as close to a Bioshock movie as we’ll get. I personally love that movie because of its weirdness. There’s videos out there explaining all the similarities and what not. If you haven’t seen it, I recommend it, and you’ll see it has the same look as Bioshock.",ri7edd

While long paced I liked the “lack of plot” for the most part. I could watch these characters be self destructive sociopaths for many more hours.

i6dx961,"the issue wasn't where it ended, it was the ridiculous plot holed path to get there.
a) why would cooper keep all his money in someone else's safe - especially when he knew she was devious
b) why would anyone put that much effort into a revenge plot based on so little reason and with so little control over the outcome
c) and I could go on and on..

brilliantly acted, directed, filmed and screenplay was good too.. but the plot was so stupid that it was utterly contrived.. its was just a lomg ridiculous ride to get up one scene.. cooper's final scene.. that was the big payoff. With a smarter plot it could've been far more meaningful.. it could've mean more like a Shutter Island.. instead it was crapola",ri7edd

I think the only moment when we can question if it was a genuine reaction or a faked reaction was when Stan outed her hatred of her mother and her depression publicly.

hym56l3,"My read was that he was a recovering alcoholic. Maybe his abusive father forced him to drink and he stopped upon leaving.

When he goes inside and finds the geek that is a slight moment when he is talking to the geek that it looks just like him! The weird relationship he had with the geek where he game him the cigarette and also when they drop him off at the doctors Stan wanted to make sure he was taken care of before they left but his boss said don’t worry ( there was a sign in the Alley that was lit up saving Jesus Saves when they first walked in and after he left him there the lights went out and said Us Saves ) subtle but big Signs",ri7edd

hvzs4cl,"Im reading the book and so far it makes way more sense than the movie. Im at the part were Pete dies.

So far, no mention of the elaborate set, and he never had a thing for Molly beyond thinking she was hot. In the book, he actually does sustain an affair with Zeena, who he's way more into than her him. It's an actual plot point, and it's even explained that Zeena is only into him because he reminds her of a young Pete. 

The bit where Stan gives Pete the alcohol also makes way more sense in the book. Zeena had kept on blowing of Stan to be with Pete, so Stan decides to give him booze so he'll pass out and he can fuck Zeena. The death is purely accidental, but his motive is purely selfish, not well meaning and driven by pitty. 

The bit in the movie where he mixes up the alcohols is so dumb and I saw it coming a mile away -- why would anyone store two alcohols so close together? And why would anyone, knowing this, fail to make sure they brought the right one with them?",ri7edd
hzq8ckq,"I think you need to consider your lack of imagination and ability to follow the plot is not a flaw in the movie. Like in regards to Zeena, they clearly have an ongoing affair. Its what brings Stan closer to Zeena and Pete, which is how he learns the mentalist act.",ri7edd
hwbm7m5,"The movie never really gets going, imo, until he begins trying to scam the judge. You need the introduction of the geek to give the ending power, I just felt it drug on forever. I also didn’t buy the Rooney Mara- Bradley Cooper chemistry. She felt “stiff” to me. That being said, the last third of the movie was great. I actually did not see him becoming the geek up until the “it’s only temporary…” part. It’s been a while since I’ve seen a movie that has had this much difference between acts.",ri7edd

hpfnbxk,Two big problems led to the issue of this being too long. The structure is very much like an older rags to riches story or even film noir. If you’ve seen a few of them once the second half hits it gets somewhat predictable because this structure has been done to death almost 100 years ago. The next is that it might flow better on a rewatch since during the carnival scenes and even some of the second half there’s probably a lot of subtle stuff to develop the characters which is what Guillermo loves to do. I would always be looking in the background for stuff that he put in and would be thinking what it’s purpose is. I do plan on rewatching it so hopefully on a rewatch the pacing won’t be as much of an issue.,ri7edd

Things happened, but it was a bit *slice of life*.

Don Draper was a good character study that managed to give you a sense of who he was, even while he was evolving in some ways, and others ultimately not at all, and you got pieces of who he really was and things that made him the person he is today.

iqmqoz4,"Lilith's scar is from Grendel but in a very specific way. Many of the characters in the film are connected to one another before Stan comes along, and in the case of Lilith and Zeena, that's taken literally - they were born conjoined twins. Identical twins are often said to have ""true sight"". While Zeena and Lilith aren't identical, they were once in the same body, which is equivalent - this is is referenced with Enoch (two halves sewn back together) and his ""mystic eye"". Zeena's cabin is #2, The High Priestess. She does cold readings for her act, but several times in the film it's suggested she's got the gift ""for real"".   


Re: Zeena as the High Priestess, there are many other examples where tarot is supertext for the film and its characters. If there's interest I can write more about that, though I'd be surprised if nobody's done it elsewhere. It adds a lot of dimension to various events and motivations. Lilith's card is one of the most obvious... 


So, back to Lilith. It's worth noting that both sisters are still ""truth tellers"" after being parted. Zeena hides behind chicanery and Lilith behind psychology, but they both make a living the same way. Lilith still using her sight is made explicit by the ashtray in her office, which depicts an ancient form of prophecy where young women inhale toxic smoke. Stan stubs his cigarette in this and she reads through the fumes. Her career is also a cheeky comment about talk therapy not being all that different from what people seek from Zeena at the carnival - clarity, resolution, peace of mind. The clientele and pay are worlds apart, though! 


Lilith is very successful at what she does, but she's also seperated from her ""family"", the carnies. Not completely, though. Stan thinks he's playing Lilith but she's always two steps ahead - not just at the end, but from the moment we meet her. She knows all about his act, the alcohol poisoning and Stan's past with his father through Zeena and the carnies. Lilith is also very familiar with misdirection and mentalism. He has three years experience, big whoop - she's probably been doing it for thirty! 


She's also quite happy to set up Grendel to suffer and die for what he's done to other young girls. Lilith might be a ""success story"" in multiple ways, but at that time, that kind of surgery was often fatal experimentation, even for a skilled surgeon. Don't mistake Grendel's surgery on the twins as something done out of selflessness.

I also think it played into the theme of trying to escape yourself because Stan had spent his entire life trapped in the setting he was born into. When he finally had the chance to live his own life, he failed and I don’t think enough movies talk about the realistic fact that middle-age people fail even when they’re just trying to make their lives better for themselves.

Emphasis on ""see"". Yes we could tell time had passed because of the beard and whatnot but when you see a character one way for 145 minutes and then they subtly advanced forward in time and he's completely changed for the last 5 minutes it's a little jarring. 

My point wasn't that it was out of the realm of possibility, but that the pacing is off and you throw out a ton of character development to tie a bow on the story arc that was extremely obvious the second you see him with a long beard. We just watched the man have the drive to con an obscenely rich person, murder multiple people, fake a car accident, etc. all just to keep the grift going.

io4c0hg,Exactly! I picked that up as well. The rotation of the camera at that point was certainly deliberate.,ri7edd
hq2gyww,"I agree with what your saying but think about this also:

 Dr. Lilith saw an opportunity to use a mentalist’s delusion that he was all knowing and able to have power over others thoughts and feelings because of that  , to manipulate him into getting rid of her clients she realized were beyond her help.  

That their entire relationship from the moment they met was a war  essentially between psychology and the intellectual understandings of the mind , and things like mentalism, tarot .  Because at the end of the day they are two versions of things we as individuals reach towards for mental health, depending on how self aware we are of the help that’s truly needed. 

And by the end of the film, we come to understand that this war, is won on the side of therapy. That if Stanton wasn’t so disillusioned, he would have recognized that she wasn’t his mistress, they weren’t working together. 

She was using him to kill off her clients who believed that therapy wasn’t the answer 

That he was. 

I believe that the scar in her body was from grindle, and that’s why she warned him of how dangerous he could be , and that she used his daddy issues to her advantage to get him to push him over an edge, be it to kill himself, or be murdered. Much like patients previous .

And then when Stanton returned in the state that he was, she realized how truly horrifying and beyond help he is, and shattered the illusion for him. 

 if he truly accepted the therapy she was giving (and charging him for as we learn from how much money he is left with by the end of the film) , then he wouldn’t have taken the drink, and wouldn’t have returned to her in the state that he was after such a brutal murder. He would have been horrified , and demanding true mental health.

But this was a movie about the true horrors of man and how if we do not recognize and accept them, we become them. So in the end it’s rather fitting it ended the way it did, regardless of how predictable it was.

Sorry if this is a TLDR 

I truly loved this movie and went to see it alone so I haven’t had many people to gush over it with

hpifuxx,"I’ve read that but I don’t see that. Ezra wouldn’t come to her for therapy if that was the case. 

Someone did it to her, and her only recourse did hurting Ezra, who she knew was also an abuser, is how I read it",ri7edd
htr6dh8,"I was at a screening in L.A. last night. GdT did a Q&A afterwards, and he confirmed that Lilith's scar was Grindle's handiwork.",ri7edd
hvbfnyf,"That was my take too, but not sure if it adds up. When would the abuse have taken place? After she was his therapist? Because it seems unlikely you'd work with someone who had abused you. I wonder if the book contains any answers.",ri7edd
hv8fx2k,I thought that too but how would she get to Stan killing him? That’s my reservation on this theory. Though I was in the same camp,ri7edd
hv90fci,What a great theory!,ri7edd

hqmvp8p,I think it was always a set-up. She’s a scientific mind and knows there’s no such thing as a medium. She couldn’t debunk him in front of a crowd so she took him down just because she could read him as well as he thinks he can read others.,ri7edd
hwxw3bm,"Just finished watching it.  When she shot him in the ear, she said, ""Am I powerful now, Stan?"" leading me to believe that she had her fun with him and got rich in the process, but always planned on ruining him because he humiliated her publicly by calling her powerless.",ri7edd
hv85fgz,"I think the plan was to ruin Ezra all along, via Stanley. During the final scene between Pete and Lilith she speaks to him in a way that makes it sound like she is getting catharsis, and also even says the word “transference”. My theory is that Ezra gave Lilith the scar, and the whole thing was her way of getting retribution. In the end when she tells Stan that he “is a small man” etc… she is actually speaking to Ezra.",ri7edd
hvux73f,I just came here to ask this question or find the answer to it. The interpretations in the tread are good but it is not evident from the movie. This is the piece I think the film is missing.,ri7edd
hxjls3v,"Exactly 

It was very heavy on the exposition and we have a protagonist who just came from nowhere we know nothing about so it seems like that’s where he would end up",ri7edd

hqpkqpo,"Because it was made to be seen in both formats? The original is black and white, the other classic noir movies of the 40s and 50’s when Nightmare Alley came out are all black and white. They specifically thought about the black and white composition during filming. Here’s a direct quote from the DOP 

In a statement, “Nightmare Alley’s” director of photography, Dan Laustsen, explained the process. “When we designed and shot we were always thinking color and black and white,” he said. “The classic lighting I have used is an homage to all the incredible masters of cinematography who have inspired me.”",ri7edd

hsmm4oo,"""Spidora"".  Legit carnie gaff, though the version shown in the movie was way more realistic than the real life effect.",ri7edd
hvdks6w,Legit reminded me of when I was a kid and saw snake woman. I screamed! Mind you this was sideshows in the 90s. I’m sure it looked bootleg as hell but thinking back it was terrifying,ri7edd
hvwcq3z,Interestingly enough — the actress that plays the “spider woman” is married to Willem Dafoe in real life (who plays green goblin),ri7edd
hqni80q,i think i agree,ri7edd
i5ppe72,"yesss, brilliant observation",ri7edd
hw6emcw,Very true,ri7edd
huopl69,"I think she was personally insulted as a doctor of psychology (which she prides herself for) that the older gentleman she was with (a patient of hers) was rejecting therapy and turning to occultism for the answers and to heal. Same with Grindle - he rejected therapy and was trying to buy healing from some easy mystical way out. I’m sure there’s also a connection with the scar on her chest and Grindle hurting women, so she was using Stanton to get back at these (former?) patients, but she also knew Stan was a fraud and resented his arrogance in mentalism.",ri7edd
hvu0pbu,"Don’t forget the Rooney Mara character says to Stan that she’d seen Lilith at the show before, so we can assume Lilith had made him a mark by the time she tests him with her ‘what’s in the bag’ move.",ri7edd
hsd6xr6,He seemed like the right guy for the right job. She saw an opportunity and took it. It was predominately nothing personal about him until he called out her relationship with her mother,ri7edd
hqogkhf,She probably herd from her friends that’s there was a mentalist performing in town. She went to a few of his show to get a sense of his ability before she decided to bait him by interrupting the show to see if he’ll be good enough for her scheme. She didn’t expect him to identify her own personal struggles and she felt especially humiliated and decided to then extra personally fuck with him,ri7edd
hvp8zy2,"Not sure why you were downvoted, maybe because in your prior comment you seem to imply that the drinking was due to him killing someone and breaking down, however here you are spot on. At the beginning of their sessions she asked him why he winced when she poured herself a glass of whiskey and he said because he could smell it even though he was some feet away. However, before he downs his first glass, she takes a sip and they kiss. Which would imply she not only got him has slowly accustomed to the smell by associating with her, but got him hooked. It was an similar to how William Dafoe’s character gets the geeks hooked by introducing them to small amounts of opium.",ri7edd
i0coxp8,"also what was he supposed to do, send her a text to not come?",ri7edd
hvwrr1e,"I mainly copy pasted this reply from my other comments on this thread. But I also really love this movie and I there’s so much that’s left unstated about the characters motivation but if you read between the lines you gain a lot of perspective. 

If you enjoyed this movie and my comment I really recommended the show Hannibal. I loved the show Hannibal when it was originally airing and a lot of the discussion about the show was about analyzing the character unspoken motivation. This was also encouraged by the show runner who had discussion about the psychology of the characters with the fans at comic con.",ri7edd
hvwse6u,Also I loved how the “the war of who’s the better reader” played out because at first we are shown that they are equally matched. But she very quickly starts dropping lines that show she had a better understanding of him. After a point she was even gloating how much she had him wrapped around her finger (when she was asking him about how he killed the previous mentalist when he had given zero prior indication that’s what he did. To use Drag Race terminology she clocked him immediately and then she read him to filth all while he didn’t even recognize that she was doing it),ri7edd
hq0vcyr,The guy who bit off the chicken head is the literal geek. The movie tries to show how we are all chained to our addictions and are metaphorical geeks a few times though.,ri7edd
i1up3po,I think he didn't even consider escaping since he had gotten shut eye and believed in his own powers too much.,ri7edd
hqynqub,I don't know about you but it made her look more villainous than anyone else,ri7edd
hovhfoh,"I would definitely still recommend you check out the original if you liked this one. Overall, I think it's the better movie even if this one has the improved ending.",ri7edd
hozed5q,I actually think it might have been,ri7edd
hvzf8mu,It isn't. I doubt he'd want to go back to the same carnival too.,ri7edd
hqijjmk,"Keep in mind that new movie has the same ending as the original book. The old movie came out when the Hays Code was still in effect, which meant they weren't literally allowed to give it as dark an ending as the source material.",ri7edd
hxjcr0d,"Yeah, there’s definitely something more with the aborted fetuses plot line.",ri7edd
hpif509,"Yeah. I clocked the ending early. Suspected when I first saw the geek, *knew* it when Dafoe started telling him how. 

He told Lilith “it’s all about the dough.” She knew that was his weakness. She played him. 
And, I mean, her haircut tells you she’s gonna be the downfall of the man (I’ve seen noir films).",ri7edd
hq9dboi,"Lilith's ego was hurt because she was bested in front of crowd and client.  From the Ph.D. to having her own practice in the late 30's/early 40's with rich and powerful clients revealing their secrets, regrets and fears, all this leads to power and ego being her motive. That's the whole reason for her first interaction with Stan. She wanted to show everyone that she had figured out Stan's act.",ri7edd
hw02tu8,"That’s what I thought when I was watching, and that was really the moment I realized he was in way over his head to the point where it would be impossible to back out. I kept screaming at him to skip town, but obviously he was too full of himself to realize even then he had bitten off more than he could chew.",ri7edd
hsluo7n,"I think the 1947 ending was a copout and some bullshit

This ending seemed appropriate to me",ri7edd
hq4ef4c,"That’s how I’ve always understood it, and it fits that very last shot pretty well.",ri7edd
hp1pfuz,I thought The Last Duel was great. I really enjoyed the story structure. I remember my girlfriend and I were the only ones in the theater the night it was released.,ri7edd
hq2nxa7,It's an interesting perspective! I definitely got that sense that there was some kind of competition going on between since the first meeting at his act. I never felt though Dr. Lilith was trying to help anyone. For me I thought she was just curious to see how far she could manipulate Stan. I really thought the scar was something related to grindle and the only reason she wasn't killed was because she's from high society and her dad was very prominent. The gradual manipulation of Stan to becoming an alcoholic felt so much like a power play by her. That she had a deeper grasp of human mental manipulation than even Stan with all his arrogance. I thought the movie was beautiful and one of del Toro's stronger works. I also watched it alone and loved it,ri7edd
hqbcji9,"The second he picked up that drink I just mumbled under my breath “god you fuckin idiot” 

But had such a massive grin on my face because of how much of a genius I realized Dr. Lilith to be 

Will probably go down as my favorite work of his, and of the year!",ri7edd
hv96bx5,"Interesting. I interpreted the movie as being about power dynamics. Having power over others. Every major character is part of one or more lopsided power dynamic. Stanton made Lilith feel small and powerless when he told her that her gun was for power but that it would never be enough. She was abused, probably by Kindle, and hated feeling powerless. She used her work to feel powerful. So now she used Stanton to get her power back by conning him.",ri7edd
huvcb5g,Do you understand why when she says I love you he senses there is something wrong?? I still dont get why that triggered him,ri7edd
hvnv1ty,Just watched it tonight and your comment hits hard: “Their entire relationship from the moment they met was a war essentially between psychology and the intellectual understandings of the mind.” She calls it out- the newspaper she throws on the table saying “didn’t you hear? We’ve declared war.” Absolutely brilliant.,ri7edd
hqfdf2z,"Great synopsis, saw it last night and found myself just nodding my head as I read your response. Well done!",ri7edd
hr6qa0y,"I have no idea what you all are smoking that made you see the ending coming. It felt like such a natural character piece, ambling from carnie film to art deco noir movie, I had no idea where we might end up next.",ri7edd
hsdb30q,I wasn’t sure how to take his drinking the drink at that point. It seemed to diverge from his character. Someone who hasn’t ever drunk wouldn’t just down that booze without a wheeze or a cough. It’s one thing that bothers me about the portrayal. I really appreciate your comments about the movie!,ri7edd
hviysm5,"how many time did you watch to reach the current conclusion? I like your interpretation, inspiring. Also what do you think its the letter J(J maybe?)",ri7edd
hvwybvd,Yeah he shouldn't have taken that drink.,ri7edd
hw64ov6,">  psychology and the intellectual understandings of the mind , and things like mentalism, tarot .

and polygraph!  I loved that touch.  just saw the movie.  loved it.

Do you think Stanton was an alcoholic all along?  he took to drink like fish in water",ri7edd
hvj9398,I’ve only just seen the film and love this summary,ri7edd
hx06w75,"This was great analysis and exactly what I hoped someone could put into words after I just finished it. I thought it was portrayed in a beautiful way, absolutely loved it.",ri7edd
hx5qph7,See I didn't see it that brandlys Cooper character became delusional or needed mental help.  What I got out of it is that he continued to do it for the money and got greedy,ri7edd
iokz2px,Same but I don’t like how the ending slapped me on the face with its obviousness. I personally would’ve preferred a more subtle/symbolic approach - eg ending after showing him behind the chicken cage and waking up in a carnival.,ri7edd
iqmrkri,"Forgive the necropost, I just finished watching the film and added some observations a bit higher up the thread tree. I think you might get a kick out of them and how they dovetail with yours.",ri7edd
hxqx2hy,"> She was using him to kill off her clients who believed that therapy wasn’t the answer

Stan brings to Lilith the Ezra job, so I don't think this is true.",ri7edd
im8dsrt,"One thing I don’t understand is that a lot of people on here are saying Dr Ritter wanted revenge against Grindle, but how was she accomplishing any kind of revenge if Carlisle had succeeded in making Grindle feel at peace? If Grindle hadn’t walked toward the woman at the end, which ruined the illusion, he would have believed it was really his mistress and he would have felt at peace, which is what he hired Carlisle for. Dr Ritter had no way of knowing that Grindle was going to be violently killed, especially since he had a bodyguard. So what kind of revenge was she expecting?",ri7edd
hprs192,">Ezra wouldn’t come to her for therapy if that was the case.

Was he a current client?  It could easily be that he had once been a client, and then something violent happened.

Also, Grindle mentioned that he’d never told anyone about his history with women.  That seems to make it more likely that Lilith wouldn’t have known about it unless from personal experience.",ri7edd
hv92o96,You read it completely wrong then.,ri7edd
htrgk2c,Definitely explains why she's motivated to manipulate Bradley cooper now,ri7edd
hvc44zx,There were only vague lines about grindle hurting women but I assumed he may have hurt Lilith when she was younger. Probably close to the age of his deceased wife. He couldn't kill her because of her status but that's my guess as to when she may have been scarred. I don't know if I'll ever get around to reading the book to know that answer.,ri7edd
hwyb0dt,what if it was Grindle's kid,ri7edd
hvm67kl,I think she always did. He humiliated her publicly. She in turn ruined him,ri7edd
hqnbjw9,Solid interpretation. I like that this film left the audience with unanswered questions that are worth thinking about after we leave the r,ri7edd
hw5fjri,"But her campaign resulted in the innocent judge and wife dying.

Wouldn't she want to avoid that?",ri7edd
hwy9lqz,"I like this interpretation. Did you like it?

Edit: elsewhere in this thread someone makes a good case for Grindle having been a client of Lilith’s and being responsible for the scar. He threatens stan referring to “other snake oil sellers” which may have been a reference to her.",ri7edd
hv9hlrn,"You mean Stan and Lilith, right? 

Someone else in this thread pointed out that it is possible that Ezra hurt Lilith *after* she treated him, which would explain why she doesn’t want Ezra to know that she is connected to Stan.",ri7edd
hxsvv03,It dawned on me before the opening scene,ri7edd
hyp6z93,"Spinning off this, is there any possibility that the baby in the miscarriage was Enoch? I never quite understood the purpose of him in the film, and I think it could be a neat parallel. Is there anything pointing against it?",ri7edd
hw6e17m,Agreed,ri7edd
hwfztnd,That scene made me cry. That dude was such a piece of shit.,ri7edd
hvi0wao,pretty sure when they kill the chicken for kosher/halal it looks pretty close to what you saw in the movie lol,ri7edd
hwqcfa4,Because we need a little controversy!,ri7edd
hqpqc5s,"Didn’t mean that as a challenge, just curious. Thanks for the info.",ri7edd
hutntx9,"I saw it tonight in black and white - it was simply stunning. I’d like to see color as well, though - I read that the cinematographer says it’s like two different movies.",ri7edd
hqwhvxi,Molly literally says that she's been to the show a few times.,ri7edd
hqotvrn,"that's quite possible there....

in addition to the scheme, it was also an ego boast to personally destroy this person (which she successfully did)

Makes me wonder, does this shit happen in Real-life?",ri7edd
hvpeqsq,"Totally agree! My initial comment definitely implied that which is obviously incorrect. It didn’t take away from my point at all, however. So appreciate you being able to separate the two. 

I’m in agreement with everything you said! This is a guy who’s always on, as he put it, but was being conned from the beginning. Such an interesting watch!",ri7edd
hvwrwmw,"One of my biggest impressions from Nightmare Alley was just how confidently the film felt “showing” not “telling”, which will certainly keep it in my mind the next several weeks. I’ll check our Hannibal too, thanks!",ri7edd
hq0vyfr,"Ahhh I see, it's starting to crystallize for me now. Thank you!",ri7edd

hovhl6v,Oh I’ll definitely be checking it out. This was one of my favorite movies of the year.,ri7edd
hsqmjvd,"Well, that's just your opinion if you like the darkest ending better. I still like the '47 version that gives Stan an at least ending with Molly taking good care of him. You don't see me complaining.",ri7edd
hp1qzp5,I didn't like how Bradley cooper was smoking a cigarette in literally every scene in Nightmare Alley.,ri7edd
i0q5zv9,"She had a deeper grasp of mental manipulation than him because she wasn't arrogant. Her confidence was born from the ability to unflinchingly know herself, while he could never focus on the things that shamed him.",ri7edd
hv8ggn1,The kiss with the booze on her lips. The loud clink of the glass.. masterful,ri7edd
hwlu4ak,"I already had the thought it might happen.  But the moment he takes that drink was when I knew he’d turn out to be the geek.

That said, him taking that drink kind of comes out of nowhere.  They didn’t build to it very well, especially for someone previously against it, without temptation.  Pretty much my only gripe with the film.",ri7edd
hyyh9bf,that was a moment of Lilith's victory over Stan.,ri7edd
hvgfi0a,"Exactly! I feel as if the war between psychology (dr Lilith) and mentalism( Stanton) can be regarded as an overall power-struggle of the mind.  Every character we meet is one that has some sort of mental health issue , and that issue is ultimately something that buries Stanton deeper into his own issues.  At one point it could have been assumed that Dr. Lilith genuinely  wanted to help him. But I believe that , like what you said , she just wanted power. She saw Stanton as a broken mind that could be manipulated into a delusion  that could be controlled somewhat. It wasn’t until Stanton started to drink that shit truly begun to unravel. Cuz it was a movie about power in a sense . how to get it , how to lose it , what it does to the mind , and the  lies people will tell to try to keep it.  

The thing i love most about this movie is that at its core it’s about humanity, and the grotesque complexities that come with being human. Because of that it can be interpreted so many different ways, while ultimately having an audience that still understands it’s  core morals. What you take away from its themes all depends on the type of person you are when you watch it for the first time; as movies that center around a theme of just mankind in general are highly empathetic.",ri7edd
hv265qg,"I believe this was the moment he was truly made into a geek. If you consider Clem’s methods - giving a potential geek booze with opium - I saw some parallels. The opium-laced booze was in this case the relationship between Stan and the doctor. She provided him with information, money, and excitement.
And then she withheld for a while and “threw him the chicken” - told him she loves him and he instantly got weak. Same method! The man was turned into a geek twice.",ri7edd
hxxh2fr,"They talk about overselling the con a couple times throughout the film.  When she told him she loves him that was the moment he realized she had been conning him the entire time,  it didn’t feel natural and he finally saw through the act.",ri7edd
hwvyt1y,"I was thinking about this too after watching it tonight. There's a clear progress of the era at place here too. The game of manipulation has changed from pre war to war time advances. This is further reflected at the end when the next carny guy says mesmerism is out. The whole gimmick he does won't sell. But *hers* will as it's based on science, which is in, not spiritualism, which is out.",ri7edd

hzowfzc,"I couldn't tell you beat for beat what was going to happen but if you watch enough movies you start to figure out what *has* to happen for the movie to reach a satisfying conclusion. Del Toro definitely sought to misdirect our expectations a few times but ultimately we got where we had to go, and that's what people anticipated.",ri7edd
hsdmjgz,"Consider this: 

The concept of Stanton Drinking is not a divulgence of his character but rather him finally giving into the urges of alcoholism that were thematically placed through the film. 

1.) it is established early on that he has daddy issues that involve a drunk father 

2.)  Peter was a man he seemed to at first form a father son bond with , but the death of Peter shows a lot about Stantons character. That he is an enabler. Despite knowing Peter is clearly an alcoholic he let him drink himself to death. Whether you interpret that as intentional due to the anguish Stanton felt over realizing his new daddy was exactly like the old one , and his desire to be the man in control , or an innocent accident that’s up to you!

The moment when he takes the drink is frustrating for two reasons , one of them the shock of him never doing it before and the audience knowing it could lead plus the “wtf how’d he down a fifth so easily “ , the other a shock/disappointment more grounded in the understanding that Stanton is a character who always struggled with addiction , be it the high of being loved by all, or booze . 

I encourage you to watch the movie again and try to pick out instances of tension that involve alcohol specifically, because when you line them all up, it will show you that Stanton was on the path to become a geek, from the moment he burnt the house down.",ri7edd

hx00pww,"Absolutely, I believe the core of his daddy issues involved drinking from a young age , and his complete abandonment of that life to try to become a new grandeur , was nothing more but an obvious failed attempt to escape a fate cemented from the moment he left the burning home !

hr8ee1s,I agree. My takeaway was that Stanton(Cooper) was introduced as playing short cons on a nightly basis. Dr Ritter (Blanchette) recognized his skill and played a long con on him as revenge on Ezra following an affair gone wrong (cause for the scar).,ri7edd
hps5ztc,"Yeah. When I think about it now I’m not convinced Ezra mattered to her at all. She didn’t give up his info, Stan stole it. I’m sure she knew he would but regardless I think it was all just her fucking with Stan",ri7edd

In psychology, narcissistic personality disorder often is accompanied by sadism. After reading this article, [Narcissists Enjoy Other People's Pain](https://www.healthyplace.com/personality-disorders/malignant-self-love/narcissists-enjoy-other-peoples-pain), I'm convinced that Cate Blanchet's character was modeled after this disorder.

>What is unusual about the narcissist's sadistic behaviours - premeditated acts of tormenting others while enjoying their anguished reactions - is that they are goal orientated.

>When the narcissist is angry, unhappy, disappointed, injured, or hurt - he feels unable to express his emotions sincerely and openly since to do so would be to admit his frailty, his neediness, and his weaknesses. He deplores his own humanity - his emotions, his vulnerability, his susceptibility, his gullibility, his inadequacies, and his failures. So, he makes use of other people to express his pain and his frustration, his pent up anger and his aggression. He achieves this by mentally torturing other people to the point of madness, by driving them to violence, by reducing them to scar tissue in search of outlet, closure, and, sometimes, revenge. He forces people to lose their own character traits - and adopt his own instead. In reaction to his constant and well-targeted abuse, they become abusive, vengeful, ruthless, lacking empathy, obsessed, and aggressive. They mirror him faithfully and thus relieve him of the need to express himself directly. 

>Having constructed this writhing hall of human mirrors, the narcissist withdraws. The goal achieved, he lets go. As opposed to the sadist, he is no in it, indefinitely, for the pleasure of it. He abuses and traumatizes, humiliates and abandons, discards and ignores, insults and provokes - only for the purpose of purging his inner demons. By possessing others, he purifies himself, cathartically, and exorcises his demented self.

>This accomplished, he acts almost with remorse. An episode of extreme abuse is followed by an act of great care and by mellifluous apologies. The narcissistic pendulum swings between the extremes of torturing others and empathically soothing the resulting pain. This incongruous behaviour, these ""sudden"" shifts between sadism and altruism, abuse and ""love"", ignoring and caring, abandoning and clinging, viciousness and remorse, the harsh and the tender - are, perhaps, the most difficult to comprehend and to accept. These swings produce in people around the narcissist emotional insecurity, an eroded sense of self worth, fear, stress, and anxiety (""walking on eggshells""). Gradually, emotional paralysis ensues and they come to occupy the same emotional wasteland inhabited by the narcissist, his prisoners and hostages in more ways than one - and even when he is long out of their life",ri7edd

hvwtbgq,"I love when movies trust us the audience with visual story telling. This movie even felt like it elevated it further as most of the movie it wasn’t just showing it was also “implying” to us parts of the plot and it was up to us to interpret the implication. 

Just a heads up Hannibal is very very gory and does not shy away from torture. It’s also goes heavy on the “show don’t tell” as the usage of symbolism with the visual storytelling is an integral part of the plot. So you need to constantly be paying attention as well as analyzing the show. 

I will give you one tiny spoiler but it would make it so much easier to understand: the stag represents Will’s understanding of Hannibal. This sentence doesn’t make sense now but a few episode in you’ll have questions about the stag and no one ever talks about it.",ri7edd

hx015d1,"change your perspective in temptation to remove the concept of the alcohol itself being the temptress , replacing it with the environment he willingly entered that relies on the abuse of substance to generally cope with the mind games played upon others ; and you’ll realize that the build up was always there .

Dr. Lilith saw an opportunity where Stanton would come to her at his lowest that she could abuse for her own uses. That he saw her as a form of companion that would never do anything that could lead him to harm 

That she was on his team. 

But was the one who handed him the drink

He was always surrounded by temptation, simply needed someone to push him towards what he was craving

Which is why he ends up as a geek in the end bc that behavior was always deep within him, just needed a crazy therapist more invested in breaking  diluted psyches than providing genuine help!",ri7edd
hz114p2,"To me it was pretty clear that he's an alcoholic which is why he's so adamant on not drinking anymore. Him taking the drink did not come out of nowhere at all, as she kissed him with booze on her lips right before he took the drink. That can be enough for a strong alcoholic to relapse. It was all planned out by her.",ri7edd

hx00eum,"To be honest , I don’t believe it was meant to be a letter , but rather a scar that implies someone with surgical experience tried to quite literally “gut “ her. Not to be morbid, but when you got to skin/gut an animal, it’s typical to follow a “J” formation as the hook of the curve is what drives the blade up into the sternum! 

So rather than it being a brandishment , it’s more likely that Ezra , given his issues and medical expertise , tried to cause permanent harm. Hence the drama behind every implication within the scene ! 

That’s just my take tho so don’t consider it genuine fact !",ri7edd
ie54801,Stan becomes the Geek?,ri7edd
id101lw,"There is a big theme of matricide/patricide in the film along with general resentment towards parents. I think Enoch, said to have killed his mother during birth, is a reminder to Stan of his own sin of killing his father. Enoch's eye ""tracks you around the room"" and even shows up in the final scene. Stan's sin is inescapable. 

You could argue there's another layer on top of it. Enoch's story (and Enoch itself) is likely fabricated, and yet, the supposed tragedy is being packaged up and exploited by the carnival for personal and financial gain. Just so, Stan takes advantage of people's pain for his own gain as does Lillith. 

Thirdly, Enoch being a reference to the Biblical character is no coincidence. Jude 1:14-15 reads: ""It was also about these that Enoch, in the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied, saying, “See, the Lord is coming with ten thousands of his holy ones, to execute judgment on all, and to convict everyone of all the deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.” So, Enoch also symbolizes the ""holy"" retribution that is coming for Stan as well as Ezra, perhaps.

For me, Enoch was not important as far as plot is concerned, but definitely seems to be symbolic and emblematic of many of the themes at play.",ri7edd
hvghkle,"He did yeah, there were themes of alcoholism and abandonment all thru the movie 

The situation with the kiss though , it makes me realize that Dr. Lilith was in control of the situation regarding her and Stanton’s partnership, and Stanton in general , from the very beginning . 

That she while damaged , being a therapist knows how to use that damage as a tool

Sharing a booze lipped kiss is beyond fuckin genius , Stanton came to her that night ready to admit that everything needs to stop (from what I can remember , I’m pretty  sure it happened after molly broke down at the hotel) 

And then Lilith encouraged him to drink with a simple kiss and a pour",ri7edd
hz11bqy,"It's right before he takes the drink. It's actually the trigger for him to take the drink. As an alcoholic that can be enough to relapse, which is exactly what she was going for.

think when people traditionally are in work, school or eating dinner , when it seems “too early “ or “ too late “ .  Sit in the center if you can.  

I then go somewhere to write a synopsis that I can meditate on for a while before seeing it again.

Sounds corny I know but it is a really beautiful way to connect to an enjoy a movie!",ri7edd
