ho7qdng,"I really enjoyed this. To me Rylance was the MVP. There is something so deliberately off-putting about the way he plays Isherwell, it's honestly astonishing. I thought the movie handled it's messaging quite well. When dealing with a subject as maddening as the ways in which our power structures makes it so that cataclysmic events go completely unchallenged, I think completely throwing subtlety out the door was the right way to approach the story.",rcyqse

hospv20,"Deep Impact and Armageddon came out when I was a teenager.  I feel like ""Don't Look Up"" is the perfect satire for someone of my age.  I found myself laughing for the first half or so.  Then the laughter kind of turned into nervous laughter when it started to hit me that this story was so uncomfortably close to reality.  

>!When the protagonists came up with the line, ""Just Look Up"", there was a small part of me that was rooting for the world to unite behind them.  But knowing the title of the movie, I knew there was no way it would work.  Also, the scene where Jennifer Lawrence goes to visit her parents was oddly reminiscent of how the relationship with my own family and my in-laws has evolved over time (don't worry, it's not THAT bad).  !<

hob21sf,"I absolutely loved this film but understand why it would rub some viewers the wrong way. Yes, it has the subtly of a comet impact but god damn if it isn’t an enjoyable and memorable ride.

I’m a huge fan of McKay’s kinetic filmmaking style and the script strikes a perfect balance between darkly hilarious and outright depressing. I don’t think I’ve flipped flopped between laughter and existential dread this much since Bojack Horseman.

Performance-wise, Mark Rylance is the real unsung hero here. His off-kilter performance steals every scene he’s in.

In short, this is clear case of Adam McKay doing Adam McKay, will all the highs and lows you’d expect. If you liked Vice and The Big Short, you’ll likely like this. If you thought those were too preachy, don’t expect otherwise here.",rcyqse

ho5m952,"> Overall, great movie and unfortunately I feel like it’s not far off from what might happen if a similar situation occurred in 2022. Seriously

When I first learned of the premise of the film, I thought to myself, “oh, that is going to be about COVID. The last two years have been terrible, I don’t want to watch a movie about how terrible the last two years have been.”

But then ended up seeing it anyway.. and I was very wrong.

The film is not about COVID. It’s not about what *could* happen.

This film is about what *is* happening, right now, with climate change.

hpubnf2,"First half of the movie or so was a 10/10 for me. It perfectly balanced both absurdist humor and exaggeration with the somberly real. I think it did really well with exploring the different types of reaction to the situation, even amongst those who are the most informed people in the movie. I found myself most identifying with Dr. Mindy’s initial reactions. Intense anxiety managed down to treatable levels with hopium and feeling like “maybe there is something I can do” even as all that slips away until you are forced to reckon with the fact you and everyone you love and everything that exists on this planet will be obliterated.

The second half felt a bit more on-the-nose, but still good. I suppose it is hard not to be on-the-nose with some of the subject matter. We just actually live in a ridiculous reality.",rcyqse

ho136nn,"Takeaways:


I love McKay’s style 


I wasn’t a fan of chalamet before this, but he crushed his role and now I’m aboard the train

Cate blanchetts character was fantastically written

There are some moments that are a little too over the top. Specifically the scenes with pearlman

Jonah hill was hilarious as the coked out nepotistic chief of staff

Leo seemed to grow more into the role as the movie progressed. He seemed like such a static character at first, but takes some interesting misteps.

Whoever played the Bash CEO was soooo infuriating, well done to whoever played this role (never seen him before)

The writers take their shots at trump supporters and also elite oligarchs who are trying to control our lives because it is in their financial interest. In my opinion, they are taking the shot at grifters and panderers in general. People will be able to fit the moral of the story into whatever narrative they wish. 

Overall, great movie and unfortunately I feel like it’s not far off from what might happen if a similar situation occurred in 2022. Seriously",rcyqse

I enjoyed Leo's ""Network moment"" when he just screams what we're all thinking. All in all, I thought it was phenomenal and scathing in its criticism, but also did the existential dread of it all coming to an end beautifully.   


I say non-american because maybe as an outsider looking in on the trash fire it made it more palatable cause it voiced what everyone else is seemingly thinking about so much of what has gone on in the States.",rcyqse

And it'll work for you, or it won't. You probably already know which group you fall into.

Overall though, I went in with shaky expectations from the trailer and was pleasantly surprised. The humor was great throughout, got quite a few genuine laughs from me, and I personally found catharsis knowing I'm not alone feeling like the entire world has lost their fucking mind regarding COVID and climate change.

The movie is predictable and it's long but I enjoyed it. I see why critics don't like it, and I think it's gonna be controversial for audiences obviously, but personally I had a fun time with it.",rcyqse
hpvslny,"“We’ve seen hundreds of movies where the world is about to end, whether it’s Marvel movies or James Bond or the ’70s disaster movies, and it always works out,” McKay told The Times recently. “I think it’s not crazy to say that maybe that’s part of the reason we’re not taking the collapse of the livable atmosphere seriously. Elon Musk was asked about climate change and basically said, ‘I know that technology will take care of it.’ That sounds like someone who’s seen a lot of movies where you know that in the third act it’s going to work out. … For people to see a movie that ends where people don’t work to get the happy ending — hopefully some people will have a reaction to that.”",rcyqse

There’s definitely some fair criticism about this movie - but I disagree that it’s aim at the media, politics and the wealthy was ‘low hanging’. I thought it was a hyper-realistic assessment of where we find ourselves, and if it appears on the nose it’s probably because we as a society are

I found it beyond frustrating how nobody seemed to either react realistically or give a shit about the impending apocalypse except mostly Jennifer Lawrence's character (even Leo was playing it a little too cool), and all the apathetic bureaucratic politics and greedy corporate bullshit that might surround such a disastrous event. I always wonder how true-to-life one of these scenarios would be, where people seemingly go on with their mundane lives as normal (the other movie that comes to mind is Seeking a Friend for the End of the World) rather than immediately devolve into full-on violence and debauchery. These types of movies always seem to trigger my sense of nihilism.

As a satire, I found it pretty successful and it even managed to choke me up a bit at the end. I'm a bit confused about the first credit scene that takes place 22,000 years in the future, though...how are the Bash guy and Meryl still alive? And for that matter, the after-credit scene with Jonah emerging from the rubble...how could he have possibly survived that?

hpy2lm7,"I love movies that are allegorical, subtle and open to interpretation. But I also think there’s value in movies like this that are in your face with its message. I had similar thoughts toward Spike Lee’s Bamboozled which was another satire that people criticized for being too obvious and lacking subtlety. 

I also think the execution of the message in Don’t Look Up was smarter and more intentional than some of the critics gave it credit for. There was a bit of a meta commentary with the way Leo was coached to be more subtle and refined with his messaging to the public. And he went along with it until he got to the point where he couldn’t take it, and just had to blatantly tell everyone what was actually happening without sugarcoating it. 

Basically, movies that make audiences debate its meaning are great. But there’s also value in films that tell you exactly what they’re trying to say. Big reason why I’ll always be a fan of guys like Spike and Oliver Stone, two directors who have the subtlety of a sledgehammer",rcyqse

Edit: to add to how dumb humans are… conservatives on tik tok actually think that President Orleans was portrayed as a democrat and that this movie was a shot at democrats..

Australia who didn't have anything to do with this conflict  was not hurt in the war but the radiation poisoning due to nuclear fall out was slowly creeping towards Australia.

In the entire book people are going about their daily lives. Going to college, going on fishing trips, joining car races. All wile this giant world ending threat was covering the entire planet.

They all knew they were going to die, they all knew there was nothing to be done so they decided to spend their last moments doing what they wanted.

hq8pwjf,"I thought it was decent - not brilliant, not awful.

BUT ... whoever keeps telling Adam McKay to replicate The Big Short needs to stop.  The frenetic editing and meta on-screen text and all ... it fit The Big Short because that movie was about how finance bros were using flashy names and distractions to make money and then the economy collapsed overnight.  It made sense there and was different for a movie that got Oscar attention.

What did that style add here?  The movie would be exactly the same without ""Yes, it is real. Here is their logo"" or randomly cutting in the middle of a sentence (aka ""PLEASE NOMINATE ME FOR BEST FILM EDITING"").  I don't know ... the whole thing just screamed ""THE BIG SHORT BUT CLIMATE CHANGE"" and it was really distracting.

The crazy thing is you can't even really say ""that's his style"" since, before The Big Short, his style was fun R-rated Will Ferrell comedies.  I just hope he doesn't do ""current topic plus EDITING"" for the rest of his career.",rcyqse
hqf0fcj,"Just watched this movie last night. I went into it with no expectations, I didn’t even know it was a statement on climate change so I just watched it ready to take it in. I felt like it was a depressingly accurate rollercoaster.

I think it was very effective to cast DiCaprio as a mousy man with confidence issues because as the audience we KNOW he can be loud, confident, and effective. This choice alone caused so much frustration because it’s Leo and he should *spit it out* for Pete’s sake. Watching a powerhouse trip and fumble through lines was deliciously frustrating.

I think that there was some really nice tension building devices that were deliberately left to spiral rather than resolve. The transitions happening so abruptly, often right in the middle of sentences, was subtle and entertaining, yet irritating. The jokes peppered throughout only ever release the tiniest hiss of steam, but never *quite* releases the real pressure. It’s on point, especially when you roll in the behaviors we have collectively witnessed during the pandemic. 

By the end, I was in tears from how unexpectedly moving, frustrating, and disheartening this movie was. I wasn’t expecting the touching dinner scene, or the prayer, but the level of defeated acceptance was hammered home for me by the slow shot of the native figure on the hillside, dancing as the world ended. It was devastatingly beautiful, and that was the scene that finally got me.",rcyqse
hnxv6rk,"This is kind of a tough movie to nail down. I think it definitely is good for a few laughs, and it has its moments and a stellar cast. But, I dunno, I just don't love Adam McKay like others seem to. The editing always loses me early on, it's a bit choppy to me. And as far as satire goes, I think this took the easy road more than it took the clever road. 

Overall, this is not a bad movie. So don't misunderstand my criticisms. I think if you put any director with a cast like this something worth watching is bound to come out. Leo is great as the anxiety ridden doctor, Jonah Hill is a standout as usual, Jennifer Lawrence is back at it, there's so many great actors and great casting all over this thing. 

The comedy is there, but for me it felt too easy. It's so easy for us to laugh at dumb president and red hat people instead of trying to understand them. It's very easy to imagine a scenario where death is staring humanity in the face and they refuse to look at it, obviously especially after the last two years. If you're looking for easy laughs, you could do much worse than Don't Look Up. If you're looking for a satire that's so biting and so smart that it might actually change an outlook or do something about the issues it highlights, I don't think this is the one. 

That said, this movie is at its best when it's exploring the more human sides of the plot. Timothee Chalamet took me by surprise by ending up being one of the more fleshed out characters. And even though a movie like this, one that's always ramping up to some event, has an uphill battle to write a satisfying third act, I thought the final dinner scene was a very nice and grounded way to end such a ridiculous satire. 

The plot itself doesn't offer much in the way of tension, because the movie is so politically and biographically fueled that for the final plan to be successful would negate the point of the movie. But even then I was surprised they went full end of the world. You just don't see it much in movies. 

I'm feeling a solid 6/10 on this one. I think the humor ranges from solid to low hanging fruit, but I think some great casting and a solid third act hold it together. It's worth a watch.

Who is this movie for? You live in Hollywood, everyone there agrees with you. Everyone who has seen Adam McKay’s recent movies knows his political leanings going in so they’re already going to see it if they’re a fan. Whose mind are you changing here?

This definitely falls above Vice for me, though I haven’t seen The Big Short in forever, so I have no clue how I’d compare the two. Leo was phenomenal in this and I truly think he deserves some awards buzz for it, the music was great, and the ensemble of Lawrence, Hill, Chalamet, Blanchett, Perry, Streep, and Morgan make for an excellent cast. 

I have no idea what McKay wanted Mark Rylance to do in this, but that was weird as fuck. 

Anyways, I enjoyed it. Dark, funny, wild, and truly is an apt portrait of what a catastrophic event would like in America (see; COVID). Loved that they went for the actual end of the world instead of a last minute save. While some have used the film’s lack of subtlety as a criticism, I feel that with this story it wasn’t needed + McKay isn’t known for being subtle. The speech that Mindy/Leo gives when he comes back to reality after things with BASH and the Government go to far genuinely was a really great moment and felt like insane to hear done in this manner considering how politicized something so unpolitical like a world-ending comet or a devastating pandemic should be, despite knowing that the end of the world would 10000% become just that. 

Give me a sequel short of Jonah Hill vlogging until he meets his demise as the last man on earth **now**.

But one thing that bugs me that no one else has brought up is how Leo’s character basically betrayed Jennifer Lawrence’s by being the main face of the media tours after she got a sort of gag order, not defending her against those terrible hosts and then sleeping with the bitchy anchor... 

Yes he eventually also lost his cool on the show and had his own “wake up” moment, but his character was really inconsistent between caring about the comet’s impact and falling in line with the selfishness/causal attitude of the rest of the world.

hr4al6f,"Just saw this and...I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it. But there were lots of *aspects* I definitely enjoyed/hated:

* **The good:** The last 30 minutes of the film were really well done. The acting; the juxtaposition between the mission and the Mindy household; seeing how everyone made peace (or didn't). Really quite impactful. Shout-out to Mark Rylance, who was a gem throughout the film
* **The bad:** There's lots of things that I just couldn't get into
   * The humor. I think this film got...3 slight chuckles out of me? The satire just felt lazy and had the subtlety of a meteor. And while I know this was somewhat the point, when most jokes boil down to ""lol look, red hats dumb,"" or ""lol, look at the dumb, happy media,"" it just feels... too easy? I dunno, just didn't land
   * The editing. I know this is kinda McKay's thing, but I found the editing really annoying, especially in the first half of the film.
   * Chalamet's character. If you enjoyed him, more power to you, but I just don't see what people in these comments loved about the character. To me, it seemed like it didn't add anything to the film, felt extraneous, and I personally found the character annoying (his introduction, especially, was cringey)
   * Ariana Grande's character. Again, completely extraneous, completely annoying
   * The critiques of social media. Absolutely justified, ofc, and the critiques the film makes are completely correct on the media. Nevertheless, it was presented in an imo ""how do you do, fellow kids?"" sort of way",rcyqse

Just think about how many people out there don’t realize that the Wolf of Wall Street is satire/campy and think Jordan Belfort is an unironic inspiration. Or take Succession, another Adam McKay project. That’s a more subtle satire, and there’s a lot of people who also don’t pick up on that and genuinely relate to the main characters. I think the point of this movie is to point out just how much of our world is filled with morons, and I don’t think that’s as effective if you hide that message from said morons.

More accurate(depressing) than funny, which sort of hurts the humor? it really is its premise, that same joke/point over and over again. it’s an accurate point. and sometimes it genuinely is funny - some good to very good performances from the thousands of a listers. But idk if it’s funny enough to justify bashing me in the head with all the ways the world is soo fucked and is also too fucked to really solve itself for over two hours. In fairness it couldn’t have predicted the covid happening when it did.

2. Cate Blanchett AND Streep were just absolutely *smokin’* in this, like hot damn, wth not even fair. Whew.

3. Despite some of the obvious satire, I can’t help but feel this isn’t too far off from how things would really go down in this situation

4. While it did hit a lot of “topical” and “political” points, I didn’t feel like it was shoving it in your face or forcing it down your throat. It was just satirical through and through while obviously having that message of “listen to teh Science” but I liked how they portrayed it.

4. Actually got a bit emotional with the dinner scene at the end there. These actors elevated this material by a lot. I saw Greenland last year and while that had a very intense end-of-the-world feel to it, I kinda preferred how it was done here (although the two are *very* different movies)

The film felt more like a parody of America itself and ALL of its parts rather than just the pandemic side of things, which I was surprised about. It tackled Hollywood, Media, Politics, Tech, Social Media, Music, Bureaucracy, Middle America, Southern America, never really punching down.

I can see this film aging well. It covers A LOT of our current zeitgeist. I can see it being a cult film 20, 30 years from now, especially if it wins some awards and boosts its cred so it doesn't just fade away into the distance.

The action scenes too: the movie cuts away from the first rocket launch just as we figure out something is going wrong, and the failures on the second happen so fast that you can barely keep up with everything falling apart.

On another note, I felt it a little unfair that he had been offered two extra seats on the flight and didn’t offer them to his two sons, wife, Dr. Oglethorpe or Dibiasky…the literal person who discovered the comet. Choosing death on his own volition is fair but not giving any of them the choice seemed a bit dirty.",rcyqse

hqv5gm7,"I think Leo’s acting bothered me a bit, but rest of the cast was great. Script and dialogue was a bit cliche but had good twists. Of course MAGAs hate satire of themselves- surprise surprise, they think the movie sucks. Idiocracy is over their head too.

DLU made a jab at the population at large- generally too distracted and incapable of coming together to address a problem. Surprisingly good I thought; made me think a bit. There’ve been a lot of misses on Netflix.",rcyqse
hqyo87w,"Loved it. People knock it for not being subtle but it clearly wasn't trying to be. I found this movie to be so frustrating because it's hard not to connect what happens to our own world with climate change. I laughed, but at times it was a laugh tinged with... I dont know.

&#x200B;

The ending sequence got me bad though. When they're all sitting around the table, just having a nice final dinner and enjoying each other's company. When the wall shakes and Dr.Mindy puts his hand on his sons shoulder. It just felt so... human... so beautiful. I've thought about what I'd do if we were going to be obliterated like that and I think maybe this is how I'd like to go out. In the company of people I care about... just one last dinner, enjoying each other's company before the end. 

&#x200B;

hruz0l3,"I liked how even the impending apocalypse had to eventually be marketed to the people by different means (political campaign, dicaprio promoting it on the kids tv show), as if the end of the world wasn't enough. Dicaprio also starts out as a clear cut numbers guy who originally tried to deliver a blunt message on his first appearance on the morning show, but as the movie goes on even he realises the only way to get through to people is to play the game. Quite sad and accurate to the pandemic.",rcyqse
htdqdha,"I’m late to the party, but can we talk about Cate Blanchett’a character being this incredible well educated well spoken brilliant person? She talks about her masters and background with major life experiences, she is this very intelligent female character who has to play the dumb blonde character for her role on TV, and be all ‘ooh handsome astronomer’ and ‘tee hee you’re silly’ and pretend she isn’t anywhere close to as brilliant as she actually is, all while day drinking away her turmoil over the whole thing to get by and stay bubbly when the camera is on her to appeal to a mass audience? Like, my gosh. That one hurt to watch, and she played the character so convincingly that until she actually reluctantly reveals her masters degrees and linguistics skill and love for old poetry to Leo’s character you’re totally convinced she’s just ‘dumb republican clickbait TV personality’ and have no idea she is masking a genuinely intelligent mind.

Well done, and so subtle that not a lot of people are even noticing the dichotomy between her character and Jlaw, where Lawrence is unrelenting in her outspokenness and Blanchett is just as intelligent as Lawrence, just as aware of the end of times, but has programmed herself to shut that out and take the ‘media training’ to stay likeable in such a patriarchal shithole that is what I can only imagine to represent Fox News or breakfast television... just very well done to put that contrast of a character that has taken the ‘if you can’t beat them join them’ outlook and plays the win more flies with honey than vinegar sugar coated lady character.

I had chills, when he talked about the coffee, because they didn't say it was comming...but god damn we all felt it...

I think this movie is one of the best movies this year, by far. I miss movies where i have authentic characters and i see an evolution of them. Leo went through so many phases and you could see where those changes came from. I've seen matrix and in comparison matrix was just awful. Much boom boom, but 30 minutes in and i already knew how the movie gonna play out and i already knew how its gonna end. Matrix was done for money, this was done for fans.

For example: >!The fact that at the very end they took very old wealthy people who have no actual skills for colonizing a planet and I don't even know if they would be able to actually reproduce there was alot of old women as well that probably already hit menopause.

There was something so real about the world literally crumbling around the family and them just trying to enjoy a nice dinner together and block it out. It encapsulated the fatalism that I think many of us have about global warming/COVID. We’ve tried reasoning with facts, we’ve tried setting good examples, we’ve tried activism, we’ve tried literally screaming at people to “just look up”, nothing matters. All we have at the end is our family, so maybe we should enjoy it while we can.

I will say that I was entertained throughout. It was a bit ostentatious. But I think the movie accomplished what it wanted to. To those that say the movie wasn’t subtle enough with its satire, I would counter that I think that’s the point.

hszv2wp,"This is the first time I actually felt the need to write a review on a movie. The movie felt like slacktivism. It felt like the purpose of the movie was to give people who acknowledge climate change as the bare minimum a pat on the back, without providing any tools on how to go about tackling climate change. DiCaprio's character asking if the plan was peer-reviewed felt like the most important line to me.

The writing was very one-dimensional. One example I can give to give the script more dimension was the use Timothee Chalamet's character. They could have utilized him as a person who grew up in an evangelical household, where he may have been instructed not to question things, to better relate to the audience its trying to reach. In interacting with Jennifer Lawrence's character, he could've asked questions from the viewpoint of a general audience member. I understand that some people felt this movie needed to be on-the-nose so people could finally get ""it."" But in its approach, it loses the audience that needs to get ""it"" and feels insultingly simplified to the ones that already get it. 

Other elements that turned me off from this film were some unnecessary plotlines, like Dr. Mindy cheating with Bri and how his wife very casually forgave him. Why was Rob Morgan's character at the family dinner? He doesn't have his own family to see at the end of the world? I guess it's because of his melanated skin >:( Sorry, that just made me cringe lol.",rcyqse

It’s full of awesome performances (Leo, Hill, Strip, Blanchett, Chalamet) and funny jokes. I’ve laughed out loud a number of times. But especially Jonah Hill kills it. I would totally give him an Oscar nom.

I thought DiCaprio's acting was way too much at times, especially that one scene where he was on live tv. Oscar bait at its finest. On a technical level I gotta say that this was pretty bad as well. There are shots that were out of focus for a small second, weird camera bumps that didn't seem intentional at all, and bizarre editing choices. It felt like the film wasn't even done yet but had to be rushed out for some reason so the editor just said fuck it and pressed export.

I can't help but think how much better this film could've been handled by a smaller studio on a smaller budget. Just look at that awful post credits scene.... Completely unnecessary and too much, all for a stupid joke that didn't land at all.

The comedy of Adam McKay's star-studded satire is only hampered by how believable the situation is as depicted, and this very nihilistic view on society, sadly, is quite on point and though some elements may go broad for the sake of humour they aren't all that far off the mark to not be considered plausible.

It's a good up front punch in our face about climate change. With the messages we receive regularly from scientists, you think getting climate change under control would be top of mind, top of the news, everyday... ""Today's Tip for you folks out there is...."". 

My understanding is that filmmakers created this to send an obvious message- that climate change is similar to a comet bearing down on our planet, that we do actually have a limited amount of time to turn it around, and every local scientists with no idea how to market their message and make it sexy can show us ways that its happening. NOBODY wants to know; ""YOU ARE ALL GONNA DIE"" - it must be maddening to scientists to see that governments persist in the status quo!

I have never been a fan of Adam McKay’s directorial style and voice - this is probably my least favourite of his to date though. I think the writing was adequate. And I think it’s too over the top to even be called satire. I think satire has gravitas attached to it. This just reminds me of Scary Movie.

This movie may not be the feel good apocalyptic drama where everything ends up ok, but that’s kind of the point when you’re satirizing the greed and incompetence that has come to plague society. As an allegory to climate change, the pandemic, or whatever civilization ending disaster, it does an excellent job at conveying the essence of terror and seriousness that we should be feeling when dealing with these issues. It’s a controversial and polarizing movie for sure, and it has to be when addressing the fundamental problems that we’ve grown so accustomed to downplaying.",rcyqse
hubpgur,"It's an enjoyable film but a bad analogy. Fortunately for us, climate change is not a 6-month pending disaster that requires only the ingenuity of Elon Musk/Jeff Bezos to fix. To truly solve the climate crisis, it would require much greater sacrifices from everyone- like eating much less meat, phasing out gas cars, and a lot more government spending (resulting in either higher taxes or higher inflation). In the film, the biggest sacrifice people make is to look up at the sky. Moreover, we don't have all the technology at hand to fight climate change, and it certainly cant be figured out in 6 months. There's so much investment and innovation left before we could truly eliminate it. The film also make it seem that climate change is a binary; and that if we just act now everything will be saved. If we were to stop all emissions today, there are still some [low lying nations that are going to wiped away.] (https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/may/16/one-day-disappear-tuvalu-sinking-islands-rising-seas-climate-change)


If we are going to believe that this is a climate-change analogy film, then we'd have to believe that the mainstream media writ-large (as Cate Blanchett and Tyler Perry's characters portray) are propagating a lie that half the country believes. That is simply not the case. [A 2019 Reuters survey once showed that 69% of Americans believe that we should be agressive in tackling climate change.] (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-climatechange/americans-demand-climate-action-reuters-poll-idUSKCN1TR15W) Of course some segments of our media, Fox News in particular, often peddle in conspiracies and lies about climate change, but even they have been marginal at swaying public opinion in this respect.


The film starts off with the President wanting to hide that there is a comet approaching Earth until after the midterms. There is no world where a President would hide a natural disaster/catastrophic event/international crisis immediately before the midterms. [Rally 'round the leader effect] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_%27round_the_flag_effect) is a real thing: it happened for Bush after 9/11, it happened for every leader except Trump during Covid (because he cared more about calming the stock market, than elections or people's lives), it happened for Obama after killing Bin Laden etc. The performances, funny bits, and overall vibe of the film make it quite enjoyable, but I really wish that I didn't know that Adam McKay/David Sirota thought this film was a good climate change analogy.",rcyqse

If this was done for the sake of good comedy, I could understand, but the jokes weren't strong enough for it to work, making the film feel uninformed.

It's a metaphor about Climate Change. Which should have been obvious given [the amount of philanthropy and filmmaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_DiCaprio#Environmental_activism) DiCaprio has done regarding climate change.

We've known about climate change for decades. It's a comet, heading towards Earth, that we saw and could have taken decisive action against. But we didn't. Because our politicians kept on wanting to keep the population happen. And the scientists have kept on screaming at the tops of their lungs that we're going to all suffer very, very badly if we don't do something about it. And still, even now, we don't. Still, even now, even when they say we've passed the point of no return, it is barely a blip on our news feeds. And we deserve that fate for burying our heads in the sand for so long.

Here's a quote from DiCaprio himself at the 88th Academy Awards:

>Climate change is real, it is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating. We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters, but who speak for all of humanity, for the indigenous people of the world, for the billions and billions of underprivileged people out there who would be most affected by this. For our children's children, and for those people out there whose voices have been drowned out by the politics of greed.

It’s almost childrens book level of here’s the good guys and here’s the bad guys and why they’re wrong. There is nothing interesting, funny, or novel about the concept that “climate change is real and people don’t care”, and this film basically flatly makes that statement for two and a half hours, over and over again. 

On a technical level, acting was fine. The movie appears to use a lot of b roll/stock footage, green screen background, and not very creative cinematography. Like 3/4s of the scenes are just one or two actors together in a plain room.

Other than length I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Thoughts :

1. I think people are too deeply reading into it as ""anti-Trump"". There was definitely plenty of inspiration (sometimes too much), but this movie felt quite science vs. ALL politics not just left vs. right. I don't think it's as political as some people (especially critics) think. It's more ""anti-politics"" than taking a particular political stance.
2. Critics complaining about the message being too obnoxious or blunt are essentially Tyler Perry saying ""we like to keep things light around here"". I feel like some people are missing the  point that the message is obnoxious because \*the message is obnoxious\*. There's a giant figurative planet ending comet headed towards us and critics are mad that this movie talks about it too much. That is... hilarious, sad, funny, weird, whatever.

From the media personalities making jokes while they try to explain the reality - and then dropping it because it’s not favorable … to the government scrapping its own best plan of action in favor of a space mining contract because they may become ultra rich if the scheme works. 

The movie does a good job extrapolating our current handling of crises to their ends and how they can only fail because society doesn’t act on information.. the information distribution is the action.
  
Not to mention that the movie shows us a healthy way to cope with the chaos of our times in the protagonists final moments, joining friends and family, being empathetic toward each other, communicating thoughtfully, sharing stories, stepping away from the screens.

There were a few moments throughout that I thought were pretty good/funny but to me most of the jokes in this film just felt so ham fisted. Even Timothee Chalamet who everyone here is raving about I didn't like at all. He felt incredibly ""hello fellow kids"" vibe to me most of the time but that final dinner scene with his prayer (the entire dinner really) was by FAR the best scene in the entire movie to me. 

It just feels like a giant ""holier than thou"" kind of movie celebrating themselves for being so smart. It feels like when celebs were talking about how hard the pandemic was and how they are ""in this with all of us"" from their gigantic mansions, just a huge pat on the back type of film. Even the portrayal of the white house staff just feels so ham fisted too. It's very obviously emulating the trump administration, but in such a stupid way to exaggerate how dumb he/they are/were. Which you don't need to do, they were plenty idiotic without exaggerating to ridiculous lengths. 

Overall, I agree with the message of this movie, and it needs to get across, but I just don't think this is the format to do it (bad satire). To exaggerate myself, this feels like punching down, which Chappelle was getting flamed for on his recent special. The message of this movie, because of that, ""punching down"", is not going to get through to any of the people who it actually needs to get through to. I really think if you cut half the ""jokes"" from this movie to make it a bit more serious, it would be so much better. But as it stands, I felt like I watched a horrible reddit politics version of a This is the End remake. I guess I'm obviously in the minority, but it is really confusing to me how many people here loved it. Sensing the downvotes already lol, but I am genuinely confused. The movie pretty clearly shows that a major problem is the ""us vs them"" and the ""hey man both sides are right"" people and yet everyone here is also not realizing that they're just loving that it emphasizes the thought that ""we're"" so smart and all the trumpers are so stupid in a poorly satirical way.

The storyline is highly predictive and they are trying so hard to achieve some type of trash/absurd humor that it isn't even remotely funny for me.

The authors didn't put thought into it's exaggeration. They made it ""exaggerating just for it to be exaggerating"" without any actual non-generic message behind it. If you want to make a movie that criticizes society, at least put some effort or deeper meaning into it. I honestly feel like a 16-year-old could have written the script.

I love most of Adam Mckay's Will Ferrel/John C Reilly comedy era, and have been so so on his meta political ""Big Short"" era(hated ""Vice""), but Don't Look Up is so perfect. Feels like a modern day parody of those late 90's apocalyptic popcorn movies. People kept saying Don't Look Up is ""political"" or skewers toward a specific political agenda, but I felt the movie PERFECTLY skewers both sides and literally all sides. On the left, it perfectly lampoons the celebrity worship and fake feel of MSNBC/CNN/morning shows as well as fealty to big tech and Apple; and on the right it perfectly satirizes the Fox News/Qanon/MAGA and anti science sentiment. My only complaint is that Jonah Hill is barely in the movie. Other than that, I almost think it's one of the best films of the year. The creepy scientist big tech leader of course steals the whole movie; his super asperger vibe was perfect. But Tyler Perry and Chalamet to me are the real show stealers. The movie ending with practically Avatar's Pandora is so perfect. And yes, 2 years into the highly charged political ""Covid"" era, it feels like Don't Look Up fits in perfectly as satire.

They should have understood the gravity of the situation but stalled in trying to figure out how to handle it. They shouldn't have been dismissive and 'oh we'll get our own people go away'. They should have said 'we need NORAD, NAVY, ARMY, AIRFORCE in a room right NOW, we need FEMA, UN, Science, Farms, NASA' and just stall out with meetings and committees and planning sessions. 

They should have left that meeting feeling like they understood the situation but the real absurdity of government bureaucracy roadblocked them. Because **this** happens.

Also, I appreciate the fact that they actually gave Leo’s character a full arc. In a movie like this where the main point is the message, that could’ve been completely ignored and Leo’s character could’ve been a one note caricature.

The critics hate it and the fans like it, to put it simply. 56% from the critics on Rotten Tomatoes, 77% from the fans. On this thread, the fans overwhelmingly like it and cite their surprise at how wrong the critics are.

Generally when the critics dislike a film more than the audience, it means that the film is too much of an action flick, or too predictable: it's the result of the critics spending a lot more of their waking hours watching movies than most fans do. But this film is a satire, and critics generally know a good satire from a poor one when they see it, but they COMPLETELY missed out when they watched ""Don't Look Up."" 

If there were any political element other than a general dislike of corrupt politicos here, I might thing it was the product of critical groupthink, or that the word had gone out to kill the movie from the media heads who run things.

hpucyql,"I am a huge fan of Adam McKay; all the way from SNL to *The Big Short*. But I think it’s time to admit that the Oscar really got to his head. The more seriously he takes himself, the less interesting his films are. *Don’t Look Up* has a brilliant concept primed for satire, but the execution of this premise crawled at a yawn’s pace. In the scene where the President finally agrees to blow up the comet, I genuinely thought it was building up to a fun third act; turns out it wasn’t even half over, barely an hour in.  

What this film really lacked was a strong protagonist to anchor me to this meandering story. First, the Internet needs to end its love affair with Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence doesn’t have the charm or panache to lead a film anymore. Meanwhile, Leonardo DiCaprio, who is usually a consistently solid actor, seems to be acting in a completely different movie. In fact, most of the cast did a terrific job but they all seem to acting in different movies. Only Jonah Hill and Timothee Chalamet seemed to understand the assignment.

McKay’s directorial style is a delicate dance between grounded and absurd; he really benefits from working with a consistent stable of actors. I really think this film would have thrived with Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Amy Adams, John C. Reilly, or even Will Ferrell filling in some seats. I hope he takes this flop as a wake-up call that he needs to return to form. Time for another broad comedy with sketch characters. Give us Anchorman 3 or Step Brothers 2 before deciding to making another preachy movie about fossil fuels or some other shit that the audience has no power to control.

But please don't mistake this claim as being anti-intellectual. I would love to see a smart, biting critique of society. But this movie wasn't it and I don't know if McKay is capable of making a second *The Big Short* anymore",rcyqse

I think Leonardo DiCaprio found a way to make his character feel real and not like a caricature, which I appreciated. He seemed to elevate himself above the material. I think Jennifer Lawrence had a pretty thankless role, unfortunately. 

Buried underneath a lot of the unnecessary stylistic flourishes (random freeze cuts, shots of nature, random Camcorder footage from other countries), I think there was actually the human story of how he lost his way then kind of came back around. I think it actually gave the movie some semblance of a heart, and it felt earnest and somewhat rewarding.

I didn’t love “Vice” so my expectations were lowered going in, but by the mid-credit (and post-credit) scenes of “Don’t Look Up”, I genuinely loved it.

hq5xc5c,"I have conflicting opinions of this one. On one hand I like the message and theme of the film, on the other I hate the ham-fisted approach. I just feel like it fails as a dark comedy ( I think I maybe laughed twice or so despite the joke a minute script) and is too on the nose for a satire.  If the comedy would have been a bit more deadpan I think it would have worked a bit better for me but it just felt like the movie was trying soooo hard to be a laugh riot with obvious low-bar jokes which might have been okay if it wasn't used to hit you over the head every second with the theme of the movie. Anytime Jonah Hill is talking and cracking jokes is annoying and jarring/deflating to the tone of the scenes. DiCaprio's character arc isn't too bad and resulted in one of the few laughs I got out of the film when he was put into the back of the car with the bag on his head but I would have liked to see his character struggle with being a yes man VS doing the thing a little more. Really hated the ending where all of a sudden everyone has a religious moment. I guess that would work for me if it was the same kind of cataclysm described in some holy book but honestly I feel like it just muddles the idea of ""Listen to the scientist when they say disaster is on the horizon."" Lawrence is pretty good in it and is the character I identify with the most but the movie kinda puts her on the back burner for awhile when that time could have been used to show her actively trying to redeem herself from the media plying her dirty but instead she just gives up which I guess sort of lines up with her character but also robs her of an arc. I just feel like for every good point in this movie, it undercuts itself with a pointless joke or distracts you by reminding you of the theme for the 10000000th time (which are often times the same thing). gave it a 5 in the poll but after thinking about it a little more I would give it a 6.",rcyqse

It was a great movie, I felt they handled the politics very well, they to me showed that both sided are fucking clueless and we as a people need to look our world in the face and deal with issues that go beyond political divides.

The film is a satire without cleverness, a bare imitation of real life that offers no new insights whatsoever and most certainly no solutions. If McKay had at least bothered to bring something, anything, new to the table this film might have had a reason for existing. Unless I forcibly scrape the barrel I can't  think of anything.",rcyqse
hqgsp5g,"The movie started well, then got awful and stayed awful.

Edit: The movie started out well.  I expected a more serious, more mature version of Armageddon, where Jennifer Lawrence and DiCaprio help find a solution to the asteroid.

The only good part after the beginning was the last dinner table scene.",rcyqse
hpx8nij,"I'm sorry, but the critics are so wrong on this. This is one of the best movies of the year. Satire is so hard to do right and in this day and age, yet the fact that they were able to do this and seem both ridiculous and real is an astonishing feat. 

The performances were all great. Jennifer Lawrence who has been phoning it in the last few performances proves she still has the talent I saw in her back in her early days. 

Timothee Chalamet was surprisingly hysterical.

DiCaprio was great as he always is. 

Jonah Hill playing against typecast was a breath of fresh air. He is always charming in whatever movie he is in, but seeing him as a scumbag was nice.

hqsgwsg,"This movie could have been great. There's an important message in there. Unfortunately, the entire thing became super revolved around the past couple of years of US politics, which is going to make it super dated in 10 years. 

The SUPER on the nose Trump parody stuff was eyerolling. I say this as a leftist. Climate change has been an issue for decades, before Trump, and now, after Trump. It's also just... not clever. Like we get it, the characters did stuff Trump did like hats and weird incest comments. Cool, I guess? The irony of this message dominating the film is that the film itself makes fun of people focusing on ridiculous politics over real issues. McKay has zero self-awareness. 

Leo's character arc was a good one. I feel like it's poignant where often times the original faces of a movement get caught up in their own personal ambitions and lose site of their original goals. It was also just a nice character arc in general.

ho3gplb,"Great movie that was legitimately terrifying. Pretty much an accurate portrayal of how science is perceived and how moronic a large portion of society is. People offended by how on-the-nose it is simply don't appreciate that the world truly is like this. COVID, climate change, religion, etc. You're not cynical enough if you don't think this is an accurate portrayal of society, it's not even a satire. The movie was hilarious at times, but I was often too scared to laugh, because this film doesn't even exaggerate the current state of anti-intellectualism. I think some people will find it offensive, or sanctimonious, or preachy, or holier-than-thou, but it really isn't, it's terrifyingly accurate while being hilarious. If you leave this movie offended, then it did its job.

They didn't waste time being too scientifically accurate, because they would have lost the plot if they had. This movie was more about defending the scientific state of mind, rather than trying to be an accurate scientific portrayal. It was more about watching a hapless toddler waddle off a cliff, while everything you try to do to stop it fails. If you love science and feel that the world doesn't listen to the people who actually know what is going on, then you'll enjoy this movie. My only gripe with the movie was that >!they had the science-minded characters fall into a prayer circle near the end of the movie.!< They should have poked more fun at religious people, and taken a Dawkin's like approach to the end, something more nihilistic. Regardless, it was great, even if it does fill you with existential dread.",rcyqse
hpv8pch,Disappointing film for me. Didn't find it funny and the aggressive editing style just felt unneeded.,rcyqse
hpw7ic9,"If I completely agree with the politics of the movie and I still think it was a bad movie then you have a problem. This is the most proudly unsubtle movie and it just doesn't work. Well, not exactly, Big Short was also very unsubtle but the movie works because of the comedy aspect of the movie, frequent 4th wall breaking and actual stories of the characters are engaging. This on the other hand is just pure liberal porn and nothing else. Even more so than all of Aaron Sorkin's work which is also very masturbatory. I'll give this movie one credit is that it shows that large corporations are the real power behind inaction over global warming (the comet), not the conservative rubes. This movie won't convince anyone who already isn't convinced which given that it was the primary motivation for making this movie just makes it fail spectacularly.

Recently the show Squid Game came out, which also has strong political messaging, in it's case being a critique of capitalism, but the show takes a much more subtle approach, the story is still the most important part and it doesn't bash you over the head with it's messaging. The show doesn't want to make card-carrying communist by the time you finish the show, instead it focuses on the story and ideas are sprinkled throughout. People who'll really liked the show might look up why workers in the game wear masks and seemingly have no personality and might stumble and read something about capitalist dehumanization of the working class. Others might not care but like show and recommend it to someone who will end up caring. The setting of the games is also very much removed from anything else which makes it work across cultures and languages (unlike this movie which is aggressively American, where other countries don't matter at all and politically it's purely about late 10s early 20s of 21th century America). There are effective and ineffective ways to spread political ideas and messages through art, this movie (unfortunately) is very much in the ineffective side.

What else to say about this movie, Leo and Jennifer Lawrence are great. Timothy Chalamet has been in 50 movies this year but somehow is in this one too and does well even though it's bit outside of his element. Meryl Streep is unfortunately completely wasted in this movie, could have replaced her with just about anyone. Jonah Hill is lowkey hilarious and probably best part of parodying the Trump administration. I liked Chris Evans's cameo. And I thought the final scene with the family at the dinner table was quite touching.

After watching the movie I looked up what production company made this movie and it's some company Adam McKay founded, and it's so evident. As much as I and others hate when suits mess with director's work, this movie is a great example why it's an important part of the movie-making business. He badly needed someone above him to tell him to trim the fat out of this movie. This movie goes on for two and half hours and still somehow has plenty of minor parts that go absolutely nowhere (one that immediately comes to mind is Lawrence's boyfriend being portrayed early as an important character, all for one joke about him writing a blog and we never see him again). The Ariana Grande song going on for 3 minutes felt ridiculous (and I actually like her songs). Sometimes less is more.",rcyqse

I think what lets this film down more than anything though is just how unfunny it is. They seem to be trying *really* hard with some of these bits, but basically none of them land. Scenes just drag on way too long and they beat every potentially funny joke to death.

I loved the absurdity of the scene and how effectively it showed how groups of people will blindly follow propaganda without trying to find out what is real or factual.

This is applicable on so many current relevant topics. Of course climate change is the big one, but there's more to it.

Another weird thought I had is that the movie is about itself. A movie about media influence is influencing our view of the media we consume, which the movie is a part of.

This is the most depressing comedy I've watched so far and yet I'm glad I did.

hpypdrh,"Just watched it, here are my first thoughts.


Chamalet's character had some of the funniest lines in the movie and he executed them well. Actor of Bash CEO was outstanding. DiCaprio was amazing which did not surprise me at all. The news host and the astronaut were also great. Hill, Streep and Lawrence were decent but forgetable IMO.


The writing and editing in this movie was phenomenal. The Big Short was still more to my liking than this movie, but it's undeniable that McKay has a great way of inserting his own style in any movie. The movie has its hard-hitting moments too, some of the serious speeches were exceptionally written. Feels like the plot was predictable at some points though.The Pentagon chief that charged money was a great touch that exemplified everything I liked about it. 

The satire and some of the themes are definitely not subtle at all. Climate change and the pandemic are the super obvious allegory. I very much enjoyed how traditional and social media is portrayed in this movie though (the actor who called for less fighting made me laugh out loud too). But I think the portrayal of the political system and capitalism was a little too on the nose personally, it could have been delivered less preachy.


Overall, I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. Gave it a 9/10, my favorite satire/disaster movie to date.",rcyqse

hqfkoar,"Overall I didn't like it. Bad writing throughout, with many many jokes that fell flat. Jennifer Lawrence was the only character that really felt realistic. DiCaprio was okay, but an odd choice to play a nerdy anxious astronomer I thought. The subplot where he cheats on his wife contributed nothing to the movie and was totally unnecessary, as was Timothy Chalamets character. Not sure why she needed a last minute new boyfriend for the final act. Especially one that acted like a high schooler when she, as a PhD student should be in her mid/late 20s. But whatever. I think if you're satirizing real life, you need to present realistic situations not a straw man representation of real life. The celebrity stuff was straw man shit. The morning show segments was straw man shit.  I liked the message of the movie and the trailer showed a lot of promise but the execution was botched.

My mom watched it before me and just said it was ""stupid."" Love her, but she has horrible taste in movies and no ability to absorb anything beyond surface level action movie explosions so I KNEW I had to see it. I also read an article which pretty much trashed the movie. But, I could tell from the way that they talked about it that they were really really stupid and probably missed the entire point and I was so fucking right.

 This movie is just slapping the viewer across the head with parallels and at the same time it's so funny because it's creepily accurate. It's like... TOO on the nose right now, you know, since we're literally living through this movie on multiple levels (climate change, coronavirus, tech overlords, oligarchic fascist state parading as a democracy).

Would've worked better as a 5-10 minute sketch on SNL or something than an almost 2 and a half hour long movie, but I see that more people liked it than didn't, so eh what do I now.

The quick edits of people and animals in different last moments of their lives-from the person waiting for the train to the baby to people at the beach hoping to watch the comet to a slow motion of a bee and then the slow motion shaman that was doing his last ceremony while the sky rained fireballs-all while they’re at dinner discussing apple pie and Mindy grinding his own coffee.

It is not a great movie. I would maybe give it a 5 or a 6. It has *many* flaws.

But the biggest criticism from NPR was ""this movie is too smug and it is leveling its satire at the wrong people (the media) when the situation (with climate change) is really very complicated.""

It really *isn't* that complicated. It really isn't!

It's simple! 

The only way it becomes complicated is if you are some big corporation that doesn't care, some politician that doesn't care (aka Biden), or some small(er) entity like NPR that relies on those who support moderate politicians and moderate corporate donors.

It's just not complicated!

And talk about smug!! NPR is *consistently* the most smug news source on the internet. It's horrible.

They didn't address in the *slightest* the way that this movie takes on self-aggrandizing billionaire corporate donors (who effectively *fill the coffers* of an entity like NPR!!! Either directly or indirectly.) 

This moment in NPR history single-handedly made me delete my NPR podcast channels as just being hopelessly center and corporate owned.

NPR is a joke.

Again, this is *not* a great movie and it deserves all of the criticisms it is getting, but for NPR to *completely ignore* the fact that 1.) they themselves *are* one of the media entities being satirized and 2.) they themselves *are beholden* to the kind of ""middle-of-the-road"" mentality that leads to doing nothing other ""wring-your-hands-in-mock-earnestness-and-worry.""

I am so fucking tired of these middle of the roaders.

“Hey there fellow kids. Check out this meme of JLaw with her face mangled. This is good meme, yeah? What about face photoshopped on cat?”

You know what, I don’t even mind on-the-nose satire as long as it’s funny. South Park nailed this with the post-covid specials.
This movie didn’t. 

Virtually no character development. I didn’t care for DiCaprio’s kids or Chalamet’s character, so the emotional ending scene wasn’t impactful.

The future planet scene was lame and unnecessary. Screenplay was awful.

I don’t know how this came to be or what their relationship is, I found out about the movie thru Sirota’s Twitter and thought it was gonna be some low budget random shit. Heavily surprised that some “unknown journalist” cowrote a movie with Adam McKay. 

Sirota was the editor of Jacobin, worked on the Bernie Sanders campaign, and now runs a news site called the Daily Poster, and a lot of his focus is proving with hard evidence how corrupt the government is (which is probably why the politicians felt differently than other political comedies). 

If you felt moved in any way by the movie definitely follow him and checkout more independent journalists who have more freedom and a sort of personal calling that makes them less likely to soften the news or lie, as is common in mainstream media as shown in the movie.

Look, I'm not really bothered by the fact that this movie is blatant and heavy-handed. I think you can do satire like that really fucking well, even in our post-satire world in films like *Parasite* or *Sorry To Bother You*. But the biggest problem with *Don't Look Up* is that it only has one message which is...  


>**THE RICH AND POWERFUL ARE GONNA FUCK YOU OVER.**

And that's about it. That's the one message this movie really has. Hell, I think if you between the ages of 20 to 50 you already know that shit. The movie doesn't really have much else to give you in terms of laughs or other sociopolitical angles to explore.

What I think works out the least is that Leo and Jennifer are super super miscast. Everyone else is playing some kind of character and them playing more naive scientists who are supposed to represent everyday people so don't work, especially when they are some of the most recognizable actors/actresses working today. I think it becomes a bit exhausting and predictable after a while? There's nothing really flourishing in the comedy or the storytelling that'll engage you there.

That being said, there are some funny jokes here and there. Mark Rylance is great, his character is a fucking hoot. Rob Morgan, who is like the unofficial third protagonist is also really good at the best level of balanced, but knows he is in a ridiculous situation.

I thought in particular the idea that a professor and doctoral student would be flown into the White House to personally persuade POTUS that a comet was headed to earth was so ridiculous that I would have needed the movie to keep upping the ridiculousness. Reading so many comments that the film is ""so accurate"" is driving me a bit nuts. 

I get what the film was trying to do, and sometimes, it did it really well. When POTUS >!forgot her son/chief of staff!< and Isherwell (Rylance) >!kept assuring everyone in the command center that everything was fine before sneaking off to the ""restroom"" aka private spaceship!<, I thought the tone and pacing was perfect.   


But other scenes just made me sad for investigative journalists, research scientists, and elected officials -- or especially healthcare workers since the film decided to embrace the pandemic as a unexpected backdrop for its storyline -- who are really trying to make a difference. It just seemed like a cynical movie playing tragedy for laughs and mostly blaming ""those people"" that didn't land for me.",rcyqse
hqbhdfl,"I get that the film is supposed to be a satirisation of American politics, and it's a good one at that. 

I'm not sure how controversial an opinion this is. But I still find it annoying how American centric the asteroid deflection plan was. As if the rest of the world would sit on their hands waiting for America to save the day. 

And I understand they tried to hand wave that away saying all the countries for some reason piled their resources into one mission in Russia, barely before the comet hits. Contingency plans exist...

But let's be honest, India, China, Russia all have nuclear weapons and the capability to launch rockets. They all would have their own plan. They would want to be the saviour of the world. This mission wouldn't just hinge on the president of the United States. 

And I understand that's not what the film is about, but it just gets tiring when America is always the centre of everything as if the rest of the world doesn't exist. 

Again, it's not a ""plot hole"" or whatever, but the omission of that is annoying. 

It's why films like Arrival and The Martian were a breath of fresh air. Things were a global effort. 

Also, I just kept thinking they could just put all the information they had on a social media site like Reddit, and it would have spread like wildfire on it's own. They didn't need the media.

hqhbjtx,"This movie was fucking bleak man. 

Adam definitely nailed the overall theme he’s trying to convey.... but fuck man. It’s already hard enough dealing with how society seems to be crumbling and giving up, the last thing I needed is a movie kind of shoving it down my throat to a point where I felt as exhausted as Leo and Jennifer after 2 hours. 

It’s hard to finish this film and admittedly have a bright outlook on the future after. 

If there are a few things I’ll say positively about the film, Mark nailed it parodying Elon Musk, Timothee’s brief role around the final hour of the movie was really great, ESPECIALLY his prayer. When death is imminent, a lot go to religion as a last resort for comfort, and McKay nailed that moment and gave it some real respect there.

And one last positive thing is that the final 30 minutes make the movie worth watching. Adam really has a knack for nailing the final acts of his bleak/angering films like The Big Short and Vice. This is no exception, even if it’s absolutely fucking depressing to watch. 


So with that, if you’re willing to stomach how far gone society has become for 2 hours, it’s not the worst film to watch. It’s just also one where you’ll never watch it again like “Requiem for a Dream” because you’re gonna feel like shit after",rcyqse

Like I don't know why, but seeing people just start doing whatever in complete panic, whether it was rob stores, riot, just start having sex with whoever is nearby made me deeply uncomfortable. I can't fully articulate why, but it just made me throw up.

Would I call that one ex I still had feelings for and just admit it? Would I just find the nearest guy / girl and just have a sexual experience one last time? Would I stay with my family? Would I just sit out in the backyard with our puppy in numb silence and accept that my life was a complete waste of energy?

There were funny moments where I genuinely laughed but Leo’s acting was irritating me, especially during the scene where he was yelling during the talk show (and more so throughout the movie).

It was a very accurate portrayal of the past two years which is scary to think about, the world is currently a satire/parody of itself? Yikes…

The general who takes their money.  Except the Pentagon is on the side of preparing for climate change in real life.

Also this evisceration of daily entertainment news?  The connection wasn't clear enough.  Am I supposed to hate the Today Show for being the Today Show, and not covering hard-hitting news every day?  Their ""light"" theme for programming certainly didn't seem to point to any of Fox News' shows.  So I'm left thinking that McKay feels we should hate the Today Show for not keeping us updated on climate change on a daily basis?

The analogies needed more thought, but the overall message of the movie was good, and Rylance was hysterical as a Jobs surrogate, though again, it would have been better if he were a Bezos or Musk surrogate.  >!Having a spaceship!< doesn't make him a Bezos or Musk surrogate, he was 99% playing the science denying Steve Jobs, entirely.",rcyqse

I scanned the QT code on a flyer for the promotional concert and that took me to an Ariana Grande video so I figured the phone number might provide an Easter egg that tied in to the premise of the film. I ended up getting connected to a very real telemarketer pitching me “peace of mind” with a Life Alert device.  She then transferred me to a salesperson named Noah who was very upset about the number of angry callers that have ranted at him throughout the day. He said he was oblivious to the fact that the number was in a movie and utilizes their “peace of mind” slogan. I filled him in and we had a good long chat about not internalizing other people’s misdirected anger. Apparently, a lot of people unload on telemarketers and Noah doesn’t need that. I hope he takes my advice and spends a few minutes in positive meditation at the end of his shift. I’m keeping Noah in my prayers. Nice guy. He said it was the best conversation he’d had in quite a while. I still didn’t purchase a Life Alert device for my “peace of mind” but I like to think I helped Noah find some peace of mind himself. He said he was going to watch the film tonight. Maybe you’d like to call the number and say a few kind words to the nice folks working there and help lift their spirits.",rcyqse

I had some issue with the acting, though. Or maybe it goes back to the writing?

Jonah Hill was just way over the top.

Chalamet and Lawrence were given some great lines but their characters werent fully fleshed out. The personalities were inconsistent. In one scene, Chalamet is a twitch-loving anarchist bro, and the next he is passing a glass of wine to someone elegantly?

I don't understand the people saying it was one joke for two hours. There was one premise, but so many jokes ripping on government, billionaires, liberal media, social media, pop music, and Hollywood. I think you can apply the metaphor of the comet to a lot issues focused on by both sides of the aisle that get swept under the rug by the system of government, corporations, and media working in tandem. Climate change, Epstein, COVID veing ignored in the beginning, COVID restrictions going too far now, etc. Climate change was definitely the main one, but it showed how emotional believers of anything get labeled as crazy and good looking and reserved advocates get assimilated into the mainstream.

It's comedy, and despite having the typical quality of being over-the-top, it's also extremely relevant today and not really too far-fetched either. 
It also made me do a lot of thinking about climate change. It shouldn't even be a discussion to begin with, and at one point it could already be too late.

hr7mupz,"Really funny for the most part and captured a lot of feelings one has facing the utter ludicrousness of how business as usual and profit motives act in the face of creeping destruction, as well as how trying to cope fucks with you, but the ending frustrates me a bit.

China, Russia and India together apparently only have one launch site for rockets and nukes? That seems unlikely. Each if those countries has launched stuff into space by itself and has a lot of nuclear armament. Could have gone a step further and have had the CIA sabotage *all* launch sites. It would fit the rest of the narrative. Feels a bit handwaved and very US-centric.

Also, don‘t show the rich-assholes ark actually arriving at its destination. It shows them as far more competent than they are, even if they do die to alien animals there. The Bronteroc punchline is funny, but I thought the punchline was the investor guy telling the president this nonsense line their algorithm garbled up to show how inflated a lot of big data marketing talk is. Show them die in the cryogenic pods or explode upon launch or better yet, show them in a bunker that survives the meteor impact, but show them starve or kill each other, because these kinds of people have become delusional because their ability to thrive in the current economy and do certain very impressive things is so disproportionately rewarded that they consider themselves incredible geniuses, blind to the weaknesses they obviously have and unappreciative of the work that people with less monetarily rewarding and more banale skillsets do. By which I mean stuff that keeps our world running and enables these folks to do the stuff they do.

Overall still an enjoyable film.",rcyqse
hratyq4,Completely un-subtle dark comedies really need their own sub genre. Something like try-hard dim lit comedies.,rcyqse
hrbxr7s,"Watched it yesterday and I have to say I love it.

I saw that some newspapers critizied the movie for the way it handles the situtation. I have to admit this very specific case where something that size and devastating is right above peoples' heads is perhaps not really comparable to many other things people won't accept or believe that are harder to spot or require the evaluation of data. In that way sure, press won't ignore something like that in real life and perhaps the role Bezos, Jobs, Musk etc. was a bit too much. 

But in my opinion I'd rather like a movie that goes into this Kafka motif of ""what is going on here, doesn't anyone see that this is not supposed to be like that?"" that parodies certain ""types"" of people for a given, quite unrealistic event than having them parodied or ridiculed for anything they did or said in an interview like many satiric TV shows would do it. 

But those things aside what I really enjoyed in this movie was its consistency with many small details. Like BASH phones automatically finding a video. The same video that way later shown somewhere on a smart phone. At first this presentation starts off fine but then he adds that it will also call a therapist for you and make an appointment. It's this small line that was added to show us how this technology is getting out of control. And then when the singer and her boyfriend get back together the BASH phone automatically buys their albums. 

Or how we see that the droids first crash on start, then on the comet and in the final scenes they just had to add this one escaped pod that crashes right into the new planet and 50% of the cryo chambers failing to work.

It's this level of details and certain set of rules inside this movie that appear the whole time again and again. Really reminded me of shows like Futurama.",rcyqse

The massive explosion at Russia’s Baikonur Launch Complex - where a joint deflection operation was occurring between Russia, China, and India.  All 3 countries have competent and capable space programs.  

The explosion seems a bit “out-of-place”.  It is possible, and if so how likely, that the operation was sabotaged by actors put in place by the President Orlean’s administration, at the request and with  support from Isherwell & Bash?

From the way Oglethorpe is talking about it, mentioning how Orlean and Bash wanted to cut those 3 countries out of their own initiative, that they decided to sabotage the mission so that theirs was only viable option.

 I don't know crap about movie production or can claim to but assuming the satire is about how people handled ""the comet"" assuming its something like the way covid has been handled, there sure were large groups of people gathering to make this movie.

Which I don't understand given the point of the movie. They had a perfect moment to promote plant alternatives. They best they did was feature a tweet by someone with ""Vegan"" in the name only when it had no relation to the actual subject of veganism.

Leonardo DiCaprio is an executive producer of [Cowspriacy](https://watchdocumentaries.com/cowspiracy-the-sustainability-secret/).

Yes, I know, it's a comedy, it's deliberately filled with kooky characters. The problem is that it spends so much effort trying to be a mirror for society that it has to pretend that society has non-existent flaws; which it then criticises. The film moves from exhausted cliché to cliché, never bringing up any new ideas and never really putting a new spin on the old ideas. On top of that, it's so extremely USA-centric. It leans on the idea that the whole world would wait on the USA to save the planet, and only prepare one other attempt with no contingencies.

To enjoy the film you need to accept that the events are unrealistic, yet at the same time the film is presenting itself as a critique of real life. Its only message contradicts itself and there isn't enough comedy in the film to redeem that.",rcyqse

And they crew in with one man. In the last meal when the ground shook before they blow up kinda cool cuz sound does travel much faster in the ground than in air that's why if a rocket falls in your block you hear the ground shake then a boom.

This movie tried to do too much. There is way too much time spent on every facet of modern life being reexamined through the lens of its setup. I'd love to ignore the satire angle and enjoy these characters as fully original, but there are too many of them and they aren't given enough time. Timothee Chalamet's whole existence is rushed. The subplot with Leo cheating on his wife is rushed. Even if it would have been boilerplate if they'd fully developed it, it doesn't land at all this way. 

At some point Jennifer Lawrence said ""They're not smart enough to be that evil,"" which is funny because it's a perfect criticism of McKay's last film Vice. 

The worst parts of this movie are when they state a message blatantly and that message is bad. Leo complaining that cable news isn't angry enough is bad. Jonah Hill thanking God for ""stuff"" is bad. Mark Rylance's whole character, who is not a 1:1 representation of anyone real and doesn't make any sense to me for comic or defamation purposes, is bad. 

At its best moments, Don't Look Up has the quality of a high-budget Idiocracy. I liked Idiocracy, but I don't think it deserved to be nominated for Best Picture. Unfortunately, it aspires to be more.",rcyqse
i7pn2af,"If it's something the movie explained beautifully is that:

People at the top do the damage and live the lives they do because they are able to control people at the bottom using speeches that make them fight each other and keep themselves at the bottom instead of allowing them to focus on the pressing issues that actually could better their life and the planet.  
Obviously in the movie that was taken to the extreme by the ""look uppers"" vs ""non-look uppers"", which is a ridiculous premise but that's why it's a caricature. At one point neither side cared about the comet anymore, they just wanted the other side to be wrong and their ""team"" to be right  
They even went a little bit on why that this, it's partially due to the decadence of our media who mostly just cares about clicks and constantly presents the lowest common denominator content to the people ( Ariana Grande character being the spotlight of an interview where she had drama with her boyfriend and nobody cared about the scientists who announced the literal end of the world, people only caring about DiCaprio's character because he is pretty even though he was one of the leading scientists in his field, etc. )  
I thought the whole thing was meant as a caricature of every layer of society, we all have fault in what the world is becoming",rcyqse

[This piece](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/12/critics-of-dont-look-up-are-missing-the-entire-point) creates some weird strawman critic that willfully misses the point of the film, and in the process entirely dodges the points of criticism. I know it's just a very loud group of media illiterates who are trying to call critics ""pompous"" and ""elite"", but it's trying to make this movie feel more divisive than it is.

It was an annoying watch with the tone switching back and forth from serious to ridiculous and every minute containing something that’s just over the top, you’ve got to have some subtlety, not hit the viewer over the head with your points. It ended up being either a drama that wasn’t dramatic or a comedy that wasn’t funny. And wasted by my count a combined eight Oscars among cast members.

Dr. Strangelove is the gold standard for taking a serious subject and making a funny film this was most definitely not that. After how wonderful The Big Short was I understand why they gave McKay a blank check and this massive budget but that had great source material with Michael Lewis’s book and real life colorful characters, this is based on a story by a guy who is a journalist and radio host, not an author.  Since McKay also wrote the screenplay this falls on his shoulders, big swing and a miss IMO.",rcyqse

Technology/setting of the movie didnt work for me at all even though I realise it was not supposed to be taken seriously.

Like, yes there were funny moments, but i really didnt pick up a sense of mocking/making fun of. This was to me a shockingly realistic and downright depressing dipiction of us as a species.

Risking humanity for resources, god damn is this greedy. But the more i thought about it, the more i thought ""the CEO isnt greedy (he even said so, and was geniune), he is a maniac, but not greedy. He would litterarly sacrifice ANYTHING to progress us as a race."". This is to me, the species level of ""my dream is worth my death"".

We're in a world where we question our experts when we don't like what we hear. Then we make up our own results based on nothing and truly believe it rather than the actual truth. Social media has become an echo chamber for the loudest and the loudest are usually not the brightest. Yet they control how we think and perceive the world. This movie left my in a position where the choices were the world ending or the shitty president being right. And I honestly didn't know which I preferred. If they succeeded then all the scientists that fought would've been discredited. All of society would've turned on them in an instant like the sheep they are.

The movie had a good number of laughs but the flawed concept was a bit of a distraction.

Reminds me a bit of Elysium where an action film was the driver for the idea that free health care was a right that should be provided to all humanity and, instead of dealing with the fact that the idea would involve significant cost, technical challenge, and sacrifice from all of us, suggested that a magic healing device existed that could solve all problems with little effort (only withheld from the masses by evil rich people).

hr96paz,The movie for me is a complete miss. I adore the concept of mankind rejecting reality and facing consequences as it makes perfect sense but I feel this movie tried to approach it the wrong way. The jokes felt forced(to me) and you couldn’t tell if it was meant to be a satire or it should be taken seriously. Typically I’m fine with satirical shows involving emotions and being genuine. Brooklyn 99 is an example of a show I adore which is heavily comedy but sprinkles in messages about the workforce and deep rooted mental issues. In this movie I felt as though they forced these politicians and actors to be more insincere than any person could possibly be. I feel like a movie of this topic should never be satire with jokes being used to hide emotions instead of jokes being used to make the audience laugh. The only parts of the movie I liked were the dont look up movement and Leonardo’s acting alongside the news host segments. I understand the impact Covid has on the movie and it makes sense but at the same time there are not that many ridiculous people who don’t have any emotions. I apologize for critiquing it like it’s not a satire but that’s one of my gripes with this movie and I believe it takes away from it instead of added to the message,rcyqse

hpwj1gb,"I love McKay's movies, I loved the movie and found it very entertaining and the satire was very on point with everything going on with society. But I still found the commentary to be a circlejerk, albeit an entertaining very on the nose circlejerk, but I guess that was the point of it: I feel like this movie won't convince anyone who already isn't convinced.

Obviously everything looks to be an accurate satire but it's really not thought provoking in my opinion, or clever, compared to Vice and the Big Short. Vice showed the dysfunction of the Bush administration by telling the story through the perspective of Dick Cheney, his vice president. The Big Short showed the dysfunction of Wall Street through the perspective of capitalists making profit from the dysfunction. What I liked about those two movies is it made seemingly unlikable people relatable which I believes makes for a more compelling commentary.

Don't Look Up however, does not do the same approach: None of the characters that were apart of the dysfunction are relatable. All of the characters that are portrayed for the purpose of commentary are dumb, greedy and psychopaths: nobody who were targeted by the commentary are going to see this movie and have their mind changed, they're more likely to be angry and therefore oblivious to the commentary. To me, it seemed more like Hollywood jerking each other off for changing the world and wanting a pat on the back for it (as always) while they pay their A-listers millions of dollars.

hqkn9xd,"Obviously not subtle in its messaging in any way, but I also think it's making a point not to be. There's something very sick with how our society is at the moment, and while it's easy to interpret this film as 'Old man Adam Mckay yells at sky', I think the movie actually conveys a pretty important message of the lunacy that is our current age. 

Some really solid performances and memorable characters across the board. I think Jonah Hill stole every scene he was in, dude plays a douche so well. Was really great seeing Jennifer Lawerence in something new and she played her role perfectly. Thought Cate Blanchett was amazing. Her character was written so well and it goes without saying but she is an absolute mega babe. The guy who played the Bash CEO, Mark Rylance, so good. Both haunting and funny at the same time? He had that weird soulless, every-guy demeanour to him down that all these tech CEOs have. And I haven't even mentioned Streep, Chalamet, and DiCaprio who are obviously all great as well. 

I think because the film is so in your face, and so over the top some of the jokes do feel a little easy, it reminded me a lot of Idiocracy except even more believable in a lot of ways. More rooted in our current age and it makes me think how well will this movie age? Like 10 years from now, because this movie is so culturally relevant at this time will we look back at with fondness or see it as a true capsule of this insane era that we're in now? I don't know if it will hold up as well for future generations, but maybe it will. To get an honest, but satirical glimpse at what it's like to live during these times.

The movie is definitely very America focused and given the subject matter of a comet hitting the world, it's hard to believe the rest of the planet wouldn't do something more than what they do in the film. Though if you look at it as an allegory for the current global warming situation and COVID, the rest of the world hasn't really done much... 

Technically I have some issues with the editing, it's definitely original and feels different, but it can be distracting at times. Cuts and pauses at odd times that made me think there was actually something wrong with my internet a couple times. The cinematography too just makes everything kind of look like a super bowl commercial. I also found the music number in the middle, while kind of funny, mostly unneeded and was losing my attention. Maybe I'm just not an Arianna Grande fan... definitely not a fan of her acting. 

I can see why critics have trouble with the movie because of the lack of nuance, like that somehow means this isn't higher art or as 'intelligent' as it needed to be. And yes, it's over the top for sure, but so is everything right now and for the film's purpose, it needs to be exactly this just for people to look and pay attention. 

Anyway basically what i'm saying is I'm down for a comet to hit us all, let's fucking do it.",rcyqse

hqntomp,"I thought as a movie itself, it was okay, but not great.  A lot of jokes had the potential to be funny, but didn't quite land due to off-beat cuts.  This seems like a film that was made or broken in the editing room, and tbh I didn't agree with a lot of the editing choices.

However, as a satire on current events, it couldn't have been more poignant.  As I watched the movie, my hope turned to anxiety and then to dread, as I realized that the drone mission would likely fail and they were doomed.  The hardest part of this movie to watch was when they had the means to prevent the disaster, yet aborted the original mission just after launch.  They had their survival right in front of them, and instead they snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.

Also, a moment that I don't see people talking about is at the end of the film, when the newscaster says, ""We just never..."" and his voice trails off.  Reminds me of the unvaccinated COVID patients who say ""we wish we were told,"" when in reality people were screaming from the rooftops for months prior about getting vaccinated.

tl;dr Could've used another pair of eyes in the editing room, but still relevant and excruciatingly frustrating for all the right reasons.",rcyqse

hradinz,"Just finished watching it, still reeling a bit.  The star power is incredible and shows a labor of love rather than the typical cash grab.

To say the movie is a specific allegory to climate change is missing the point.  It's more about capitalism than Climate change but ultimately  It's about the U.Ss estranged political reality and the folly of our disconnections, wildly divergent motivations, our hubris.  Climate change *is* complicated, but simple act of looking up shouldn't be -- lo and behold, it was.

The final scene where >!our retirement age survivors landing and dying in a Jurassic era world!< was, *chefs kiss* irony.  We went full circle.  I'd bet money the original idea for this was presidential candidate Giant Meteor^2016 Just End it Already.  A popular meme and sentiment after Trump won his nomination.

This movie's one joke and point is that the world is ending, but people only care about social media, celebrity gossip, elections ect. This movie is that joke, on repeat, for over two hours. Social media is 14 years old now. Does McKay really think he's going to break new ground with social commentary on it?

This movie could have been good, if more care and better writing went into it. It could have been comparable to Pentagon Wars, a good comedy about bureaucracy vs morality. It could have been interesting and informative, like The Big Short was.

hq4rscj,"I don't care what the critics say: this was the best movie of 2021. It was also the most important and realistic movie. 

The apocalypse still didn't happen, but we're definitely on our way there if we continue prioritizing politics, insignificant narratives, celebrities, flying to the Moon for fun, snowflake-politically correct conversations, and material stuff.

That's why this movie being a bit over the top and not subtle at all was the best approach they could take. Although society (especially the Western society) aims to keep everything soft and subdued, people would be appalled 50 years ago at what's happening now and how we ignore everything remotely serious.

Don't Look Up perfectly encapsulates the reality we've been living in the last five years. And yes, it throws it at our faces without any shame because we deserve it and because subtlety doesn't work anymore.

In an era where society cares more about whether Kim K and Pete D went to the cinema together, influencers, TikToks, billionaire space plans, and political drama than the impeding catastrophe, this movie was more than needed. 

We need to stop turning everything alarming that's happening into memes. We need to stop being so desensitized to actual bad things and should care less about making everything sound nice because we're terrified of saying something potentially offensive and getting cancelled in the process.

This movie unapologetically portrays all of that and that's why it's receiving negative critics. Most people don't like the truth and prefer when others sugarcoat the things so they wouldn't need to feel uneasey. 
Those who are genuinely woke will care about Don't Look Up and what's trying to say.

We still have it all. But if we continue not caring about what really matters, we'll have the same ending that the people in the movie had.

""Oh, they're going to downplay the comet for stupid reasons until it kills everyone, and it's probably a satire of global warming"". Then the movie proceeds to do exactly that for two hours. I think the concept could be more properly executed in a ten minutes long youtube video.

Idiocracy is an example of a similar concept being more well executed. It's clear from the start that the joke is that the characters are trapped in a timeline where people are very stupid, but you still have no idea where that is going to take them. Meanwhile here you can already predict everything about the movie, and then you have two tedious hours to watch it uncreatively unfold. Again, long and predictable.

That said, I enjoyed the side characters and side plots.

hqrniap,"Wasn't a fan of everything in it but one of the best movies I've seen in a while. Actually got me to tear up at one point because of how emblematic it is of the crazy times we've been living through.

Think they sacrificed tightness of script for jokes at times. End credits scene with Jonah Hill's character surviving was pretty meh. President Orleans dying to a bronterac was way too obvious a spoiler that they were going to reexperience prehistoric times in some way that it in turn made me nitpick why Isherwell wouldn't be able to deduce that as a sign of their likely failure if its his own AI program (guess you could argue that was the point and they're making fun of him for not being able to read his own data but that's a streetchhh I'd say). Etc.

The Dont Look Up-ers realizing the truth once they saw the comet in the sky and throwing bottles actually felt like the parody underexaggerating and falling short of reality. In reality, people that deluded easily would've just excused that as some random other harmless comet/thing in the sky or something and continue denying. 

Orleans offering Mindy two seats on the spaceship was pretty weird too because \[1\] why would she do that when she's been heartless the whole movie and \[2\] how the hell would he even rendezvous with them, were they willing to come pick him up in Michigan when they were already wasting no time ditching the operation? If it was supposed to be a depiction of the bad guy finally showing a sliver of humanity at the end of it all, think it could've been framed with more effect. 

One the other hand, the writing was really well-done and clever at other parts. As someone who's pretty strictly unforgiving on the whole people who cheat on you thing, that was probably the most convincing scenario that made me want the two to get back together-though I guess it is a bit of an unfair handicap to have the drama of the end of the world on your side.

I'm sure it was the writers just not really putting much thought into his background but my headcanon is that Oglethorpe showed up to the dinner alone and at all because he didn't really have any family/close friends himself he should be with right before the end of the world instead, which made me feel for him even more because of all the hard work he did trying to save the world for the sake of everyone and not himself/his own loved ones.",rcyqse

hpzlr4g,"While I did not dislike the movie, I found the total need for suspension of disbelief in the entire movie to be extremely upsetting, and the fact this movie was 100% made for American viewers is just ridiculously alienating.

About the acting, Lawrence character was highly inconsistent she was smart and street sharp in some points then an entire shit show in others, she was street smart enough to call out the president when she accepted the mission because her loss in popularity, but was not clever enough to sell the idea the first time as the possible moment of glory as ""The president that saved the world"", she could have easily manipulated the president in that window.

Then the character of Dicaprio is wildly more inconsistent, we get shown that he has anxiety problems and has problems controlling it, then somehow he becomes Leonardo from the Great Gatsby in 10 mins? and then cheats and has 0 anxiety over it?, there were parts they use to give his character more dept that would have been better used to understand the transition of his personality and fixing the exposure problem Lawrence's character had.

Then there is the pacing issue, the movie takes 1 hour and 40 minutes to reach the point they wanted to show then they rush the time they have left and in that time no one does anything, hell even the main characters become meaningless  except for the final goodbye, even moments that were intended to be meaningful like the WWII soldiers discussion in the car gets watered down immediately and passed under the rug, just like Marvel movies do, lol.",rcyqse

hq0a08k,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. All the actors brought their A game(Leo certainly earned his 30 mil with that outburst on the news show, which was perhaps my favorite part). Fair bit of comedy, most of which got a chuckle out of me. The analogy between the comet and climate change worked quite well for the most part. I also appreciate them taking the road less traveled and actually destroying the world. I give it a 7.35/10

My major beef was with how the satire was executed. Firstly I personally believe that satire and subtlety are inseperable. The whole point of satire is to call something out by disguising it as something else to avoid just straight up saying what you mean. That is subtlety. If one intends to have zero subtlety, if one want to be as blatant as possible about their message(to avoid misinterpretation) then why even bother with the analogy of a comet? Why bother hiring actors and making up a fictitious story? Surely people would be far less likely to misinterpret you if you just got David Attenborough to say ""Listen to the fuxking scientists, climate change is real "" over some footage of polar bears and call it a documentary. Because of how blatant the movie is, some parts of it end up either looking silly or not making much sense.For example, the old guy sniffing the chick at that meeting is supposed to be poking fun at all the creepy dudes in tech and politics. Except, even in the real world, a dude wouldn't be able to pull that off without so much as a reaction from the rest of the attendees of the meeting. In the real world, old guy creepiness is much sneekier than that. So the scene end up being a strawman of the thing it is poking fun at.",rcyqse
hq0bjn2,"I enjoyed it. Subtlety is not required all the time, every movie (National Lampoons, MAD, Kelly comics and The Onion in general, etc, I'd put under satire and they're anything but subtle. This is about that level.) The point was to hit you over the head with it because the subject matter itself is dealing with the fact that a sizable number of people are acting really fucking stupid in the service of companies that are seeking to profit off of disaster. The scenes are absurd because the real life situation it's taking on is the epitome of absurd.

That said, some of the humor was hokey and didn't land very well. Ariana Grande's bit for the concert was pretty cringe and I can't figure out if that was intended or not. I didn't really enjoy Jennifer Lawrence's subplot with Chalamet, either. Neither really contributed ad could have been easily tweaked.

It's not the best satire, but made its point. I'm finding the people who are shitting on it are primarily the target of the satire, too, which makes it a bit funnier. They see themselves as the gullible morons ruining shit for everyone else, know it's them who are dragging everyone else down but they're more mad that they're being lampooned rather than re-evaluating their dumb ideas and commitment to inaction that are very likely to end up killing us.",rcyqse

Seeing the main characters desperately holding onto a semblance of normality as the world literally crumbles around them, the destruction given an unyielding focus as if to say “look at this, you brought this upon yourselves.”…

One to be studied for many years I bet.",rcyqse
hq4wpgm,"Ok positives first: acting’s great, nobody’s bringing a bad performance, Timothee is hilarious.

That being said, very strongly disliked this movie from an environmentalist perspective. What is it even trying to say? It’s not brave enough to make a statement other than “boy do politicians suck amirite” this movie exists solely to tell people who are already in the right camp that they’re geniuses who have done enough just by thinking the right thoughts, and it’s all the morons’ faults for thinking the wrong thoughts (helpfully ignoring who is actually at fault) Probably why everyone loves it so much. 

if the obscenely rich and oil companies all started arguing “it’s too late to do anything, might as well just spend some time with your families while you can” about climate change, most people would be rightfully skeptical, as well as angry. But apparently all you have to do is package that same message in a satire that includes brave statements such as “politicians are bad, everyone looks at their phones too much” and suddenly it’s “so important and pushing the conversation forward” instead of just being hopelessly nihilistic lol",rcyqse

Then...then the movie took a nose dive, started hanging on gags /cameo that weren't that funny or smart (ariane grande and cudi concert felt really out of place) and taking itself both too seriously on the small things and too  surreal/ridiculous on the big things. 

 Timothee Chalmette or w.e his name is shows up half way thru and plays some random manic pixie dude, who provides absolutely nothing to the plot, provides some cringe worthy dialogue and then just eats up the background scenery doing nothing.  I guess it was J-Laws character kinda becoming her own and accepting the end by saying fuck-it and bringing along this rando but it felt really...pointless?

Random montages of Planet-Earth type shot and disney channel esque soundtrack music interjected between shots of random people doing people things. Extremely lazy emotional manipulation. 

I KNOW  there were 2 distinct segments where they did multiple cuts to random people watching the news and it felt the EXACT same. I thought it was deja vu, almost copy.pasted. 

On-the-nose is putting it lightly. It went from smart and intelligent satire to in-your-face surrealism (the last scene on the new planet felt so out of place). 

I felt like I watched two films. Parts were weirdly edited, cringe acting lines ( the family dinner scene...ugh) and awful writing then other scenes were well acted, funny and interesting. 

Not sure what to think....not great not terrible. Definitely not award worthy. That being said, I loved Jonah Hill in this though, he stole the show for sure.",rcyqse

hq9lz8k,"Mediocre, but nonetheless enjoyable movie with mediocre to great performances. I get what McKay was going for, but that execution was just way off. Some of the editing was noticeable, and not in a good way. Outright bad in some scenes. The commentary McKay was trying to tell is important, but often times it felt as if the style in which it was delivered was over prioritized. The performances, particularly from the leading cast members,  saved the film and made it an enjoyable watch. However at certain times some of the performances felt as if they belonged in a different movie. And maybe that has more to do with McKay's direction.",rcyqse
hqgu6kb,"I dunno, I didn't like it that much. I mean it's an okay movie, but it's just as superficial as the things it tries to call out. Other movies have already pulled this curtain aside, namely Armageddon, The Day the Earth Stood Still, 2012, The Happening, The Day After Tomorrow, or even Perfect Sense. And let's not forget Romero's zombie movies, The Network from 1976, Koyaanisqatsi, and Baraka as bleak depictions of contemporary society. Also, in a way, the ending reminds me a bit of Fantastic Planet (La planète sauvage). :D  
It really felt like old news to me, and I don't understand the hype it receives on social media and the internet. Most of the acting is good, and some segments are unique in a way, but the whole picture just... feels worn out and unoriginal. I think the characters are very one-dimensional, even for a satire.

It also begs for the question: ""how the hell is anyone even surprised about it all?"" The things it criticizes have been around for decades, so I don't get why many people who watch it feel the bleakness of it all (especially the tragic ways of society) only now? Am I alone with this sentiment?

I'm surprised not more comments about the ongoing gag where Jennifer Lawrence can't figure out why the general charged her for free snacks. Her using serious moments to blurt out new theories or ideas on that was one of the best parts of the movie IMO.

Jonah's character praying for all the cool stuff was great as was him purposely having the bag put on Jennifer's head even though the ""FBI doesn't do that"".

One of my favorite parts was Tyler Perry & Cate Blantchett as the clueless morning hosts. Daytime TV is ultimate cringe and they did a good job portraying it as such. At first I thought it would be a bad knock off of how SNL used to skewer Regis/Kathie Lee and others, but it was rather original.

They may as well have called Meryl's character President Donaldine Trump because it was blatantly obvious. The Presidential parts were ones that seemed like they were written by a woke college kid thinking they were making a huge political statement, but Meryl played the character pretty well.

How the owner of BASH completely owned the president.. similar to how the corporations own the governments they reside in - through lobbying, and promoting political parties and making others look worse (such as social media)… how they completely cut out all the other nations out of the deal, how dumb the media people were and the garbage they were spewing (our media today is biased and doesn’t touch on the serious and troubling news of the world), and even the owner of bash’s sensitivity (when he introduced the new phone to the crowd, the announcer told the audience to avoid negative facial expressions, negative comments etc.) and how that relates to how we as a society have become more sensitive and are always making sure we don’t offend one another - gladly submitting ourselves to censorship and obedience to the higher powers that be.

I also found interesting how they made a parody of Steve jobs and Lisa (how jobs denied acknowledging lisa as his daughter) same as the owner of BASH ignoring the little girl that told him “I love you”. 

I’m a little confused as to the purpose of the movie though. Is it the writer calling out the realities of our world and making them known to the general audience?

Wolf of Wall Street, inception, spirited away, the social network, slum dog millionaire

Anyway, straight to the point. Why did this movie treat religion like it was a neat and tidy golden present that should be glorified? I was fully expecting something about people saying the comet is gods plan and they need to die from it to go to heaven. Or how there’s a metal shortage and god sent us a comet full of it for us

Ok fine, if you don’t want to mention religion it’s all good. But then they made Randall, a doctor who strongly supports science, looking at data, looking at proof and only cares about facts, mention god all the time, say that he prays, and then at the end of the movie turns toward religion? Is this some lame attempt at the “there are no atheists on deathbeds argument”? 

And then they also made Kate, who hates bullshit and is very outspoken to point out bullshit, and is a PHD candidate in astronomy, also like religion and be charmed by it? Wtf?

And then Dr Oglethorpe, head of defense at nasa also be impressed by some religious prayer as if it’s something useful? I just can’t this seriously

I'm also pretty far left politically and have very little patience for the ""kick the can down the road"" mentality that seems pervasive when dealing with this issue.  In short, the movie reflects my own personal worldview pretty well.

And frankly, I found it to be a pretty lousy movie.  

Call me old fashioned, but I guess I want a movie to aim higher than simply making me nod my head in agreement.  I want it to do more than get me to think ""yep, it sure is like that sometimes"" as it reflects my worldview back at me.

I also like how Meryl Streep’s character died exactly how billionaire man said she would, but Leo’s didn’t. He made absolutely sure he didn’t die alone, instead he was surrounded by people he cared about.",rcyqse

I was so pissed about the powerlessness and i am even more pissed about the critics on this film.

Another part that really made me drop my face into my hands was when Leo’s character was doing that lame commercial with the hot-line for stressed out citizens. It’s just so disappointing to see a public figure and think “wow they really sold out hu”, which is a relatable feeling.

a) A 10-km diameter comet will not cause sufficient damage to the Earth to trigger a 100% mass-extinction event. It will wipe out a lot of life, yes, but Eurasians in non-coastal areas should be fairly OK - especially if there's some preparatory groundwork to shelter their populace underground. At any rate, a comet impacting in Chile would not cause the kind of devastation that you see in DC and Michigan in the movie.

b) Chinese/Russians/Indians waited for far too long to shoot their payloads into space. There's no reason for them to wait this long - they should've fired theirs off around the same time as US or even earlier. Even more importantly, there's no reason why a single failure should prevent them from firing the rest of their arsenal (and why are they launching ICBM's off Baikonur anyway?)",rcyqse

hr56sei,"I liked the part where they finally looked up. Really though what a brilliant movie. Even if you don't agree with the message, it's still given in a hilarious manner that successfully parodies multiple aspects of society. Particular stand-outs aside from Leo and JLaw were Cate Blanchett (for some reason she was really hot in this movie, like her face even looked different) and Ariana Grande (basically parodying herself?). 

If I had to pick out one thing that didn't quite work, having every single group on the ""wrong"" side be stupid might've gone too far. This is why half the critics are calling the movie pretentious and smug. But maybe Adam felt like it really needed to be like this, no compromising. I agree that climate change is a problem, but I think people legitimately are working towards ways to be more enviro-friendly and eventually people will come around.

Unfortunately imo it boils down to an unoriginal mockery of just one part of the population in order to pander to the other (and I'm part of the latter lol).Every point in the movie has already been beaten to death. We know Trump is bad, too many people are anti-scientific and rich people are greedy.

And again, it's super pandering. For example, I'm a med student who loves watching videos making fun of dumb right youtubers like Crowder, Shapiro and so on, so I'm definitely against the same problems that the movie is criticizing.

hr2i8vr,"Honestly, it was an enjoyable movie to watch, bit I don't think ots going to have the impact its hoping for. It plays off very self congratulatory at times. The people who already believe in the messages get to feel good about themselves for understanding all the social and political references, but the people who dont understand or don't agree will feel like the scapegoats. The ending kind of comes across like ""see the scientists were right all along and all you brain-dead morons were too distracted by your technology to take us smart people seriously, and now we're all dead cause of you! Suck on that!"" It doesn't offer any sympathy for people who are the victims of distraction and lack of education, it doesn't provide people with any options on how to make changes and it doesn't tell them why they should believe scientists other than ""because they're always right and you'll die if you don't.""

I also think that it quite hypocritically engages in a lot of the stuff it criticises, which makes its message a lot less impactful. It casts ariana grande to play a caricature of herself, her character represents the way celebrity dramas are used to distract from real world issues, when she herself is a perfect example of a celebrity distraction. It criticises corporate greed and meaningless distractions and ""sensationalised end of the world movies"" all while being published on Netflix, having an absolutely bloated cast list of big name celebrities, and being a sensationalised end of the world movie itself.

I think the target audience of the film is people who already agree with it, and its not going to make a difference to the people that don't.",rcyqse

hq99koh,"I was of two minds about this movie.

Some scenes were fantastic (DiCaprio losing his shit and yelling at the news anchors probably being the highlight) and the lack of subtlety was necessary.

Also you could see the ending coming from the first two minutes of the film though I appreciate that was probably intentional too.",rcyqse
hqjpw0j,"It fell apart in the second act for me, particularly with the billionaire/cell-phone company sub-plot and the fact the second act was consistently too heavy-handed for it's own good. Overall, it was too muddled/scattershot for my tastes and not one of Mckay's best.

I found myself agreeing with one of the critics who pointed out this concept would have been handled better if somebody like Armando Iannuccci was writing/directing. I'd probably give it either a 5.5 or 6/10 walking away from it. I think it could have used a bit more subtlety and focus to be truly great, but just ended up being just ok.

Some of the humor worked for me, but a lot of it didn't, characters weren't properly developed and I also think think that in terms of pacing, it probably could have been trimmed down a bit since it felt overly drawn out to the point that I was zoning out as the second half went on.",rcyqse

hqqyod2,"I found the movie funnily and scarily accurate but the thing that pisses me off the most is the marriage in the film. 

Leo's character achieves fam and then hooks up with the conventionally(??) attractive newscaster, hence, cheating on his wife. She leaves his ass, good for her. Except, no. As soon as the going gets tough, the newscaster leaves and then he goes crawling back to his wife. Unbelievably, she accepts him back, no worries.

THIS PISSES ME OFF. WHY. IT'S CLEARLY JUST BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. I hate the trope and it happens way too often. And when it doesn't, it's such a big thing. I'd like it to happen as a casual thing but still a thing. Why the fuck did she take the lying, cheating, scoundrel back?? Because it's the end of the world? Maybe. But still.

Yes, it hits you like a sledgehammer, but I think that's the point. it made me think about how people in power often have the ability to fix things, but will only do so for their profit. It made me think about how people can be paid off to say things are safe when theyre not yet completely vetted, it made me think about easily it can be for people to believe conspiracies, or figures in power even after being given hard facts.

I 1000% loved that they had the balls to execute that ending. So often movies end happily ever after and honestly I'm so sick of it. A movie with a happy ending isn't necessarily a good movie. Take more risks, no, the girl/guy doesn't fall in love with them, no the person doesn't win the race, no, the world isn't able to reunite and stop a world ending disaster. 

It's almost like movies have made us believe that eventually, someone will fix it for us. Global warming ? Bah! Someone else will figure it out. Love ? It won't be ""easy"" but at the end of the day(movie), they'll bend and love me forever.

I cant decide whether I *liked* it or not so maybe 50/50 but I did enjoy it!

I enjoy DLU's satirical approach, and how it's like a feel good movie that's actually depressing but yeah there's nothing we can do but just ride along.

And maybe I'm making this up but I think they casted big names for this film but gave some if not all of us a ""bad"" movie compared to top-tier films they were famous for, is comparable to how in DLU's plot, the ""authorities"" such as the president, that tech CEO, and that NASA head who are supposed to be experts in their fields, were really just trolling the people.",rcyqse

Are people under the impression that Doctor Strangelove is subtle? The target of the movie’s ire needs to be clear for any of it to work.

hq537qp,"Social commentaries are my favourite and I loved this movie. So many little details that I've probably missed, and I can't wait to watch it again. My thoughts:

\-This felt like a mix of ""Idiocracy"" and ""The Big Short"" in the best way. It felt like a more realistic portrayal of the former (which is getting closer to reality every day) and a semi-documentary on the pandemic/climate change. Really well written and executed.

\-An unexpected detail I really liked was how the movie portrayed religion. I personally grew up with religion, abandoned it and became a cynical atheist for a while, and can now recognise the value it adds to people's lives (mostly). The movie articulated that really well with Chalamet's' character. The movie couldve taken a different route and talked about the influence of religion on politics (which deserves its own spotlight) and this was an interesting take which I liked.

\-Big business running the government was depressing but great. The little details sprinkled throughout of their power were nicely done (e.g. the lobbyists getting a spot on the ship). The twist of the comet being full of minerals, and the subsequent narrative of ""Don't Look Up"" to get the big pay day was really great and really sad.

\-Further to that, seeing how the best and brightest minds in the world are working towards exploiting the population instead of furthering it was fucking spot on.

\-I really liked how the movie portrayed both sides of the media with all of their faults. The left for being pandering and unrealistically wholesome, and the right for fanning the flames and spreading mistruths. The clip at the end of the Alex Jones-style show talking about topless women minutes before the comet hit was another big laugh.

\-Nice to see Leo play against type, but he was pretty standard in the role. I really liked the parallels between him and Fauci. His monologue on the news show was way too on the nose though, and I wish this had been done in a more subtle way.

\-Streep was fantastic. The obvious parallels to Trump worked a lot better with her in the role than someone closer to reality as it wasnt too ""on the nose"". Her tramp-stamp in the post credits scene made me laugh a lot.

\-Hill's character got the most laughs from me of course. But I felt that his character was a little too extreme in the story compared to the others, and he felt a bit unrealistic at times.

\-Cate Blanchett, wow. She's played so many different character types in her career and I thought I'd seen it all. Completely unrecognisable and absolutely fantastic.  


\-And of course the ending. It wouldve felt like a disservice to everything in the film for Earth to be saved, and it was suitably bleak and awful. The CG was surprisingly good too.",rcyqse

Her main guy played by Jonah Hill could have been Jewish and he wasn't a good guy. Leonardo, the dorky white Professor slept with Kate Blanchette. There wasn't any gratuitous interracial, gay, or lesbian action.  Timothy Chalamet was privately an Evangelical Christian and nobody made fun of him for it and everyone was rather respectful. The Meteor symbolized climate change, but it wasn't man made. And the black characters just seemed like real people, not wannabe playboys, or angry revolutionaries. There was some woke stuff like insulting Trump supporters, but it wasn't terribly distracting. The movie was so balanced it felt strange watching it.",rcyqse
hq98hgs,"TLDR: I want the 2.5 hours of my life I spent watching it back. This movie was like being hit in the face with a brick with ""THIS IS FUNNY"" scrawled onto it.

I heard the movie was good...but it never got good. I won't say all of the jokes fell flat, I did chuckle once. But a *lot* of them don't. Especially if you know anything about space, technology, or climate change. You can write characters however you want. You can write in whatever events you want. Authors have complete free will within their works. However, just because something is written doesn't make it compelling even if you write (with underline) THIS IS COMPELLING. The movie simultaneously wants to pass itself as something to be taken seriously (after all, it's an allegory for climate change) but at the same time it wants to pass itself off as satire )a la Idiocracy). In doing so, it does neither and comes across as a mess that is more focused on scoring cheap proxy attacks against real world institutions/people than telling a story.

The more I look at the movie, the more disjointed it seems. Especially when viewed as a proxy for climate change. I mean it shows the government is incompetent, cannot be trusted, and has been rendered ineffective at basically every level. Meanwhile it shows private companies as being more successful (they at least were able to land on the comet) but ultimately fails and the only people alive are the politically connected. If we replace the comet with climate change, the movie's message is that the government cannot be trusted and we should instead try to prevent whatever problems come up with private enterprise? Or is the message that the film wants to convey that nothing we do matters so might as well truck along because it makes no difference if you hang yourself, build fertilizer bombs, or dedicate your life to fixing the issue: You're dying just the same?

And one last part of the film that really stuck with me was how unnecessary the relationships in the movie were. What even was the point of the affair? That the media woman was more deserving of his affection because she is more knowledgeable/well read/connected/successful than his stay-at-home wife until she decided she was finished with him? Or was it that by going back to his family he rejected the broader society and wanted to live a more traditional life through the end of the world and that ignorance is bliss?",rcyqse

It is a shame, I think this could have been a great satire but it got in its own way of trying to pander so hard. I thought with such an a list cast it would have been a better project.

hscqmrr,"Much of what happened with the asteroid as well as with politics and the media was pretty ridiculous. 

Let's start with the asteroid.

First, it would not be possible to catch the parts of the asteroid due to its incredible speed. 

Second, no one would fly in a spaceship to another start - simply wait it out in orbit around the earth a few years and you are good. 

Third, it wouldn't be possible to keep it a secret. Way too many astronomers would know instantly, since so much data is shared and many people are involved in the process of interpreting it etc. 

&#x200B;

Much of what happened with politics and media was also ridiculous. 

First, the media would love a doomsday story, so it would not be difficult at all to get air time. 

Second, the politicians were obviously ridiculous. No elaboration needed. What was even less realistic was their advisors - with ridiculous presidents like Trump, advisors and top level administrators sort of keep things in check. If an asteroid was about to hit earth, you can bet your ass that the top leadership of the military, NASA, and government at large would react seriously.

Third, you would certainly develop many back up plans. China, Russia, the EU, India, and even others would make their own plans to destroy it or change it trajectory. The US itself would develop many back up plans as well.",rcyqse

The dialogue was nothing of substance, the J-Law & Timo making out scenes were uncomfortable, just no nice flow. I had to constantly pause and watch it the next day or next few hours.

The two main issues with climate change are:

-	the difficulty of organising global cooperation due to free riding
-	the difficulty of achieving the correct balance between economic prosperity and preventing severe global warming

The movie makes absolutely no new insights on either of these issues, and thus is useless.

They oversimplify the issue so much it is thus no longer applicable to real life. Hurr hurr, people want profit so badly that they will let us all die 🧐🧐. It’s not that simple. If we want to tackle climate change, ALL OF US will have to lower our current standards of living. This thus creates an interesting dilemma: how much sacrification of standards of living is worth preventing climate change? 

If climate change was as obvious as an asteroid hurtling towards earth, and if all it took to stop it was a one-time payment of a few hundred billion, then I trust our governments to find a solution. Yet climate change is a slow and uncertain process, and tackling it will require a permanent reduction in our standards of living until the end of time.

Jonah Hill's character was hilarious and I liked how while Orlean was giving the speech about looking down he did nothing but constantly look up.

The message was very in your face, but I think when it's something as serious as an asteroid or climate change it has been blown off so far that this movie says, ""You don't seem to understand so let me make things perfectly clear."" Hell, Orlean was literally shown as being the bag holder throughout the movie to the end.

The ending dinner scene haunts me though. This is how I'd like to think I'd spend my last day on Earth, in the company of friends and family. Which as I'm writing, I realize that Randall made the tech CEO wrong again. But their fear slipping through when the rumbling started made my heart drop because it felt so real. No touching last words or anything, just attempting to hold you shit together despite abject fear as death comes rumbling loudly towards you. That last(ish) line of, ""We really had everything, didn't we?"" will stick with me I think.

My one real criticism, which is pretty small TBH, is that I don't really like how they made the tech billionaire dude someone on the spectrum, it felt ableist and unneccesary.  
He's obviously an amalgamation of a bunch of real life billionaires, but the autism part doesn't seem to be a reference to anyone that I can think of, are there any autistic ultrawealthy tech bros who refuse to make eye contact with anyone?  

I know Musk has Aspergers, but he's not as extreme and obvious about it as the dude in the movie.

Supposedly climate change is caused by us, for one (also a majorly inflated threat..mostly political); but moving on to avoid argument there, the comet in the movie killed the entire world, and COVID has only killed 0.07% of the world's population (and that's the inflated BS numbers too).

So...ya I just don't think they are nearly related or even comparable. Sure, there are still some people who are as afraid of COVID as they would be of a planet-killing comet, and they think it's killed half the world but..that's not reality or the norm.

I think the movie is just about how it very well could play out in reality if there were a comet or some other catastrophic impending event like that, because it's all so close to the reality today:
-the government covering it up (surpise surpise),
-using the crisis for political/financial gain (this is archetypal), 
-people so consumed w their social media and celeb drama to even care or take a catastrophe seriously
-safe spaces (don't say anything that's upsetting or bad news)
-cognitive dissonance

A comet is an actual, tangible object and if you know the speed of the earth and comet and their trajectory, then it's pretty straightforward to determine if contact is going to be made or not. 

Climate change is not tangible. You can see the effects of it, but it is not an object you can take a picture of and say to a skeptic ""See dummy! There's your proof of its existence!"" Plus people generally don't outright deny climate change these days. The discussion is instead about humanity's role in climate change, can we actually do anything about it, how serious is it, etc.

Don’t Look Up is basically a remake of Armageddon, which is another thing about Hollywood, leave the old ideas a lone.   They have been parodying how the pandemic and a asteroid would have the same national debate.  To that I say F you.  COVID is real and people will die and now we are in a never ending loop of when a new disease comes out, we will shut down the whole nation.

EDIT: Finished it. Yep what I predicted, nothing great afterwards, beside Timothe and Jennifers little relationship which was actually cute, the song Ariana Grande sings is beautiful and hillarious, everyone's acting is AMAZING but that was a given.

Its a solid 5/10 because the cast was amazing, very realistic, Bill gates/Elon mu-I mean Ryan Marksomd character is literally how life is unfortunately. I feel the film didn't know how to develop the charcaters and still preach about the things it needed.

This movie is metaphor for the pandemic and the global warming crisis happening as we speak, and all of you monkey-minded nincompoops can talk about is how Jennifer Lawrence was ripped off by having snacks sold to her. Leonardo Dicaprio gave the performance of a lifetime and is not even mentioned once in the top 10-20 comments. He is literally yelling as loud as he can, and it doesn't even make your radar.

&#x200B;

There a million examples of how global warming has affected the planet with the latest example being the increase of the tick population (insects). Every single person has the power to bring the oil industry to its knees through a collective effort of boycotting, pooling of resources, promotion of science, etc. Instead, I guarantee you everyone in this thread will do nothing and die a slow death, including their descendants. You fucking idiots.

&#x200B;

Any person or corporation idly standing by while global warming is happening or actively preventing renewable, sustainable, or green energy from becoming the dominant (and eventually the only) form of energy on earth is contributing to the genocide of mankind. Anyone denying or sabotaging the consensus of scientists worldwide is a terrorist. If you are not doing everything in your power to prevent global warming, you are the problem.

If you are on reddit and pay attention just for 60 seconds, you would realize that Superstonk has been yelling from the rooftops that a financial revolution can be started **right fucking now**, and we can bring about the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind if you would just do one thing: buy or transfer at least one share of GME from or to Computershare and do not sell until the price is at least $10,000,000. The first step to solving the climate change crisis would be to bring power to the people that actually care about the planet. All the research is on Superstonk if you fucking dummies would just listen. The facts are staring you right in the face: go read the pinned thread about Computershare on Superstonk.

&#x200B;

Financial terrorism has been happening for at least decades in the stock market. Inflation, student loans, homelessness, stagnant wages, food insecurity in what is supposed to be a developed country, the only developed country without universal healthcare, unaffordable housing, the parasitic usurpation of Americans' retirement funds by hedge funds, the erasure of the middle class: this is what happens when financial terrorists and criminals control the stock market and buy politicians and government officials.

&#x200B;

America is an oligarchy. Record stock market all-time highs in an economy like what we have now is the most grotesque corruption of the American dream in the history of this country. The ultra wealthy control the overwhelming majority of wealth on the planet through crimes against humanity disguised as legitimate, everyday financial transactions. 

&#x200B;

**I am telling and yelling in your fucking face right now: the first step in changing the world for good is to buy or transfer at least one share of GME from or to Computershare and do not sell until the price is at least $10,000,000.

It is not a perfect movie. I would maybe give it a 6 or a 7. It has *many* flaws.

But the biggest criticism from NPR was ""this movie is too smug and it is leveling its satire at the wrong people (the media) when the situation (with climate change) is really very complicated.""

It really *isn't* that complicated. It really isn't!

It's simple! 

The only way it becomes complicated is if you are some big corporation that doesn't care, some politician that doesn't care (aka Biden), or some small(er) entity like NPR that relies on those who support moderate politicians and moderate corporate donors.

It's just not complicated!

And talk about smug!! NPR is *consistently* the most smug news source on the internet. It's horrible.

They didn't address in the *slightest* the way that this movie takes on self-aggrandizing billionaire corporate donors (who effectively *fill the coffers* of an entity like NPR!!! Either directly or indirectly.) 

This moment in NPR history single-handedly made me delete my NPR podcast channels as just being hopelessly center and corporate owned.

NPR is a joke.

Again, this is *not* a great movie and it deserves all of the criticisms it is getting, but for NPR to *completely ignore* the fact that 1.) they themselves *are* one of the media entities being satirized and 2.) they themselves *are beholden* to the kind of ""middle-of-the-road"" mentality that leads to doing nothing other ""wring-your-hands-in-mock-earnestness-and-worry.""

I am so fucking tired of these middle of the roaders.

Dr. MLK Jr. said it best, the middle-of-the-roaders are doing more damage to this world than the far right ever has by constantly pushing for the status quo.

Unnerving Eye Contact } when he glared at Leo with an unnatural and intense hostile gaze

All The Answers } even though he supposedly prepared for all eventualities, his drones not only blew up but failed to destroy the asteroid ☄️ 

Lack of Common Sense } He managed to have incredible spaceships & cryogenic suspension to bring a small selection of humanity across vast distances of space, enabling them to survive 22,740 years beyond the destruction of Earth 🌍

Funny thing is, one theory why there is almost no records of  that in Europe is there it was during the Great Schism of the church, and was views as a bad sign by both sides. So people were told to ignore it. And since records were mostly kept by the church, they were told to not record it.

So there was great big ball of light in the sky for weeks if not month. And people mostly ignored it because church told them to.

It’s not subtle. It’s funny but not so often that it’s worth the price of omission but that it kind of takes away some of the believability. It’s kind of the opposite situation to the Big Short.

I would compare this to the environmental turmoil happening at this very moment, the rich are trying to deescalate the situation and do exactly what was happening in the movie by sugar coating everything. Finding life on other planets rather than fixing and healing the one we already live on. 

I found this movie quite entertaining yet with an under layer of concern and sadness. 

I hope we can come to the point where people grasp the true subliminal message of this movie and work to heal the world we already live on rather than finding life elsewhere while continuing to ruin our planet, earth.",rcyqse

hsyl3ry,"I know I'm late as fuck, but I wanna add my 5 cents - I think the movie had to be so over the top. The whole point is that people as a whole don't understand until you literally smack them in the face with proof they can see with their own eyes (and even then it's sometimes not enough), so the filmmakers proceeded to smack people in their faces for two hours straight, trying to force them to look in a mirror.

I think the negative reviews claiming the satire is dumbed down too much and too repetitive, are just people sitting on their high horses waiting for complex alegories and deeply hidden meanings to be served to them in every movie with a message. But they don't realize that on average we're dumb as fuck. If the movie hid it's message any deeper, most of the people whom this message is actually directed to, wouldn't even understand it. Hitting them over their heads with a shovel may just be the only hope to change their minds, make them look up

Also, how do you even write satire about the issues presented in this movie without having it seem so dumb? The stuff we've seen mocked is absolutely what could happen in real life. The reality has gotten so absurd that the satire has to start reflecting it at some point",rcyqse

Bunch of goofy redditors pretending this is such a clear and exact representation of reality when it's an overly dramatized pile of overly political crapola.",rcyqse

1. Solving climate change isn't about directing resources towards 6 months it's about a drastic and permanent standard of living change. 
2. Climate change isn't going to displace all of us, let alone kill of us. It'll primarily hurt those in poor / impoverished nations. 

Not saying climate change doesn't need to be solved. But it deserves much more of a cost benefit analysis than this movie.",rcyqse

They have relinquished control and are choosing to be calm and together, remembering and appreciating the good times, but they all know they're just killing time until the comet hits. 

I feel like that's what I'm doing with my life. When I'm going through bouts of depression I fixate on the lack of hope I have for the future, but when I'm doing well I appreciate the time I have with the people I love, even though the bleakness is still there.",rcyqse

In that time it just LIVED in my head. The damn movie was really good but in a way that hit some existential dread for me. The ending, once we got to it, was perfect. I literally cannot think of a better way for it to end. The bit with the ship leaving Earth was a funny aside, my wife and I will still randomly blurt out ""I believe it's called a bronteroc..."" and it's funny each time.

Really good movie. I don't think I'd watch it twice in a row like some others, but will definitly watch it someday again.      
  
Overall it's easier to judge a movie by its cast than by looking at its ratings, Rotten Tomatoes is getting really bad at hitting the mark, it's starting to be like IMDB buying into a lot of the social peer pressure.

Sting farting is such a great joke. 

Also the private sector being ahead of gov’t yet not giving a single flying fuck about actualy helping people, spot on.

It was a bit too ambiguous and for some reason it annoyed me a bit while I was watching. (Am I watching a parody/satire or am I watching something different). Perhaps it was too close to reality to be enjoyable? Which isn’t a bad thing per se :D

Maybe sometimes it's good when it hits people over the head with its message because that means that the wide masses of people will understand it, maybe that's what's needed in the absolutely fucking batshit insane time we live in as far as science skepticism goes.

It's eerie how well this movie matches not only climate change and its societal challenges but also of course the pandemic and the societal challenges that THAT has brought; even though Don't Look Up didn't consider covid yet of course.

It's an important movie at the moment. I don't care that it's not high brow satire, and that it reaches for low hanging fruit. I think that's good right now. People need to watch it and understand what we're doing by letting this mess continue the way it does.

There was dead silence during Dr Mindy's outburst at the talk show near the end, even though people had been laughing just a minute before. This was the case both times I watched Don't Look Up at the theater. The parallels to our world are so heavy and you feel them so strongly during his monologue, it genuinely made me shrink in my seat. - I think the movie is reaching people *because* it's not subtle, at least I fucking hope so, because *qualified scientists* are sure being ignored and doubted a lot by large portions of the population.",rcyqse

In Office Space and Being There, it's a character surrounded by absurdity, but it's an everyday absurdity that we connect with. The characters reacting to the protagonist are downplayed and aren't crazy. They just buy into the absurdity whereas the protagonist is the bewildered straightman. We as an audience can connect to them and say ""I know what that is like and it's absurd!""

I get the sense that Don't Look Up could have benefited from having the characters around the protagonists be more toned down, almost bored by the idea of a meteor that will destroy earth. To them it's a distraction from other things, another Tuesday, and not their priority. I feel like that would play better than everyone being over-the-top, as then there is no contrast with the protagonists and it's hard to connect to relate to it.",rcyqse

They want the movie to present the simplistic world - where what the right thing to do is obvious and easy, and only prevented by people that are evil and dumb - their echo chambers have been presenting them for years now.

Thing is, majority of people are not constantly online, are not radical ideologues, and will see this through the pious, pompous, self-aggrandising flim flam for what it is. A year from now nobody will remember it.",rcyqse

well, he did believe that the plan to break the meteor did have some chance to work. It wasn't until later, during the scene that he mentioned al the scientists being kicked off the project for asking too many questions, that he lost faith in it.

From his perspective, they had already exhausted the attempt to convince the government of diversion. Supporting the break-up method was really the only solution he could work for. For him, it was either work with that plan or go home and wait to die. His decision to support the plan made sense for him.",rcyqse

People are going to relate this to Dr. Strangelove and say that wasn't subtle either. And the difference is that if you are doing unsubtle satire, you need to not simultaneously take yourself too seriously. This movie wanted to be an in-your-face satire while also being melodramatic.

I genuinely think it's somewhat ironic that the reviewers benefit from the exact phenomenon that the movie is throwing punches at. To be a famous reviewer, you are driven by internet clicks and social reaction. I personally think the movie landed those punches.

hqtfjbg,"Your quite right, it could be deeply terrifying. Especially so if they decided to make the movie a serious film rather than a light-hearted comedy. I think the movie was a stroke of genius that will be appriciated more and more in the future.

For me, the most terrifying aspect to it was the power given to the tech billionaire Peter Isherwell and the addiction people had to BASH. This truth gave the title of the movie a clever double meaning i.e Don't look up from your smartphone. 

The reason why I found this the most terrifying aspect is because this is exactly what the world is like today. Most people around the world who own a smartphone are glued to the screen far more than they should be. For most people under the age of 30, getting their phone out is the default reaction in any situation that brings on a level of anxiety.

It's so strange that a piece of communication technology has reversed a persons ability to communicate with another person.

The smartphone is our first step towards merging with technology. Some people say we are already 'androids' because of our smartphone dependancy. I think this paints a very bleak future for us where we will lose our humanity and get lost in forever upgrading technology.

I also wonder how much potential has been lost because we are so submerged by our smartphone. How many innovations and discoveries has been missed because of the generations who now feel socially awkward. Its impossible to know.

Now in regards to the power that tech billionaires have. We all know how much has been stolen from us and turned into profits for these tech billionaires. The amount of our own personal data which has allowed certain individuals to become billionaires.

In recent years, the social media giants have gained far too much power and influence. They have quite literally broken the idea of democracy because a democracy cannot exist when this much power is being wielded by one side of the politcal spectrum. These social platforms have more power than the government itself as well as the best lawyers that money can buy. This means it can become increasingly difficult to defuse their power through law. Even more so in a capitalist democracy when career politicans can be influenced.

I don't see a solution to this problem and I think it will eventually lead to violence which will look like a modern day civil war. This prospect is scary with the weapons and technology that can become available to someone with unlimited wealth and resources.

We have been living through an information war that has been going on since the end of the cold war and I cant see a way to get around a new hot war with advanced technology. People often say that China is the next Superpower but I think the next Superpower will be a private corporation followed by other corporations.

>Don't Look Up was as subtle as a sledgehammer. The message was obvious. It was very clear from the beginning what they were lampooning with little room for interpretation. It's a very simple movie in that regard and many critics don't like satire that's too simplistic.

>The characters in the movie had a very simple message. ""This is a real threat and if we don't take action we are all going to die.""

>I think we're past the point of subtlety and being too clever when it comes to the messages of the film. It needed to be delivered loud and clear.

hpwkg9v,"Why can't satire be overt? 

Feels like there was some kind of Satire Summit where everybody decided satire needs to be subtle or it's ""bad"".  When was that? 

Satire as a genre has mostly been on the overt side of things for all of its >2000 years of history. The Greek and Roman satires were often outright parodies. The modern English and French satires were usually just as obvious and biting in exposing their targets. *Idiocracy* was an extremely overt satire and everybody loves that one. 

You mention *Squid Game* but that was hardly meant to be a satire. The comparison is unfair. *Squid Game* is a dour commentary of capitalism. Satire, instead, has to have an element of mocking, sarcasm and ridicule... or it's not satire. Don't Look Up is a *satire doing what satire does* - so I find the criticism of its overt satirical elements completely unwarranted. It's like blaming a horror movie for having scary stuff in it. 

CMV but I think the reason why people like *Idiocracy* is because it lets them laugh about ""the morons"" (meaning, evrybody but the viewer, certainly) but they dislike *Don't Look Up* because it actually distributes the blame all around for a very real, very pressing issue...

Well it kind of did that sort of approach at just parodying everything: political parties, deep state, rednecks, gun nuts, self absorbed musicians, people obsessed with celebrities, social media, Washington politics, media personalities, journalists, cell phone and big tech. Though it got even less subtle than GTA at times. 

One of the big things at the end was taking on both sides as the comet loomed. One on end, skewering of the leftist style celebrity driven benefit concerts for a cause or candidate, and it's juxtaposed against a skewering of the rightist style Trump rally. But they kind of paint the rednecks as a bit more retarded since that platform is to not look up at the comet. Mind you it's like a massive thing in the sky, like Hale-Bopp or a global version of the Phoenix lights. So you have to suspend your disbelief that rednecks didn't seem to observe it over the course of months.

They made the creepy tech dude really dial up the creep factor. Honestly, he came across more like a Joe Biden parody. He seemed in shambles, then he sniffed a young woman's hair in the Whitehouse briefing room. Streep kind of functions like a Trump analogy but a weird mix of Hillary and Biden, it really isn't until the end with the rallies and the hat that she sort of takes on the Trump comparison. Before, with her scenes in the oval she seems different and even has a photo of the Clintons on her desk, and kind of channels the Hillary look and constant concern with polling and political maneuvering. 

The media parodies were great too. You have Chiklis as a version of Hannity, but he's not in the movie much. Meanwhile there's a whole thing with New York Times parody killing the story on the comet because it isn't getting enough traction. There's a sort of morning show hybrid parody that's part Morning Joe, part Good Morning America, part Ingraham Angle. There's a CNN parody at the end too.

Good. The movie trashes everybody and people apparently get really offended because they identified with some of the characters. Doing that ruins the critique the film is trying to push. It's just a bad idea in general to find role models from fiction, and there are a lot of people who felt improperly ""represented"" by this film.

It's a dark comedy, not a comedy-comedy. But if you're not in the mood for that, or even prepared for that, then you might end up hating it. There are no heroes in this film, so don't look for them. There is no happy ending. There are only characters with heavy flaws and their inevitable failure. It's a totally weird subgenre of film, so if you're not expecting it, you might get a ""wtf did I just watch"" feel.

- the movie lampooned the world of media pundits, social media and celebrity worship and called them all inconsequential, and movie critics are part of that whole circus - some people probably took it personal  
- many felt it was ""unsubtle"" - this one is baffling to me. The movie was clearly in the genre of satirical farce lmao  
- group think, a bit like on reddit, the first few comments set the general tone for the discussion, happens time and again with movie reviews

Some legitimate complaints include 

- it wasn't necessarily very clever (e.g. selecting a unusual perspective to tell its story), it was tonally dissonant, went on too long, the humor wasn't consistently great (I did laugh throughout tho?)

I agree to some extent - Don't Look Up wasn't necessarily very ""clever"" (but hey, why can't a story just be told straight?) but I disagree with the ""circlejerking"" accusation - I don't think this movie was conceived as a tool for changing people's minds. It was just made to hold up a mirror to our society's approach to real crises, which it definitely succeeded at, and it distributed its fair share of blame on the vapid media and celebrity worlds too. I suspect that the reason why most detractors don't like it is because it gives off the impression of ""punching down"" while movies like Vice or The Big Short allow the viewer to mock and scorn widely-recognised ""Bad People"". Which is weird because Don't Look Up didn't even punch down that much but squarely focused the blame on politicians, media outlets, corporations in bed with the governments and Internet ""influencers"". But the subject of human catastrophe through climate apathy is topical and I think a lot of us took it a smidge personally (a lot of the critics surely did). 

This movie will age like fine wine. In 20 years when the climate situation will be even more catastrophically bad and we'll still have politicians and Internet quacks telling people that the comet isn't even close, people will enjoy this movie even more (through the tears).",rcyqse

hqv7wg7,"A 10km comet could easily wipe out about 80% of the world population, no problem. Are you aware that the astroid or comet that wiped out the Dinosaurs was 10km? 10km is enormous, Thats 6.2 miles. Even half that size could be considered an extinction level event.

 It's not just the size of the comet that matters. It's the impact velocity and the mass of the comet that matters the most. The shockwaves would be carried around the entire planet multiple times. The Tsunami's would wipe out all life a couple of miles inland from every ocean. The shockwaves would create winds all over the world that would be off the chart, potentially reaching speeds of +300 mph. Anyone caught above ground in these winds would not survive. 

The comet impact would superheat and ignite the atmosphere all over the planet. This would kill anyone on the surface who managed to survive the impact, the Tsunamis and the winds. The sky would literally be on fire and burn all organic life from plants, animals, insects and of course humans. A superheated sky after an impact is what is believed to have wiped out the Dinosaurs. They was quite literally cooked to death.

If you was lucky enough to have survived all of this, next you will have to deal with a new ice age. Not sure if I would consider it lucky to have survived up to this stage. It's not a normal ice age because most of the plant life has been incinerated and most of the animals are gone. Without a stockpile of food for the 10 years you will starve to death.

When you combine all of the above, this 10km comet is easily an extinction level event. There will be survivors but were only talking in the hundreds on a global scale. If we are optimstic and we predict that 500 people might survive out of 8,000,000,000, that is a reduction of 99,99999%

There are a ton of videos on YouTube and websites that explain everything that that I've said will happen. Go and have a look and you will see that 10km is plenty big enough to wipe out all life on the planet.

Now onto your second question...

Yes, your right. the nations took far to long to try and stop the comet but it's just a movie at the end of the day. In reality, nobody, not even a tech billionaire would have the ability to prevent an attempt to stop the comet just so he can make a ton of profit from the rare minerals. It wouldn't happen.

Here is another truth that the movie didn't address and will get you a bit worried... 

We still don't have a viable solution to prevent a 10km comet from hitting us, even if we knew it was going to hit us a year in advance. 

It is a problem that a team of the worlds best scientists tried to solve but they failed to come up with a solution that would work. The team of experts included some of the worlds best engineers, physicists and astrophysicists but they still couldn't provide an answer.

The obvious choice that most people think is to simply hit the comet with a bunch of nukes. This could break up a 10km comet but then your still left with a bunch of smaller comets that could cause the same problem as one big comet. It would be near impossible to carry out a surgical strike in the exact right place to cause a break up that would help us.

Another solution is to gently push the comet so that it misses Earth. The problem with this solution is it will be too late to push the comet to miss Earth by the time we reached the comet.

People think we have a solution ready for this but we don't. We don't have the technology to move a 10km mass in space yet. Scary thought aye!",rcyqse
hqwmbuq,"The point is the major countries of the world (Russia, China, India, etc) aren't doing shit about climate change either.  Nobody is.",rcyqse
hquzzht,"Your thinking about it logically and the premise of the movie was how illogical we are.

I thought even a mile wide asteroid would wipe us out. Your talking about a much bigger rock.

And what would firing nukes do? Absolutely nothing. You would need to know many years in advance to be able to stop one of them and I dont think nukes really work that way. Last I heard they think they could try to send up multiple craft to try to pull it slightly in a different course. But I'm not an expert by any means.",rcyqse
hqwuyqc,"Thought the same. I get that the movie wasn't trying to be too realistic when it comes to such aspects... BUT, the friggin world is ending!!! Really no more effort was done?

Russia is a large country that is mostly empty but with a lot of oil and natural gas. They are not as capable of launching like we are.

Tellingly, even when shit is really dire, he still tries to plan for a future that won't come (he asks Kate to be his fiancee like 8 hours before the end of the world - is that human optimism or human foolishness?).

If enough people see how messed up things are w.r.t. climate change that they made a whole ducking movie about it, that’s amazing.

If we replace the comet with climate change, the movie's message is that the government cannot be trusted and we should instead try to prevent whatever problems come up with private enterprise?

Because it’s about climate change and how blind our society is. DiCaprio has been campaigning for climate action for decades. He is using this film to raise awareness. 

It’s an allegory for how climate change is completely going to destroy society and devastate the planet, yet most people don’t even realise how bad it is, many people don’t believe it’s a problem or even exists, maybe people think it’s a government hoax to “control us”.

The scientists have the data, it’s undeniable it will devastate us. Yet there’s nobody in charge taking it seriously, and the elite and rich is society are in control of our politics preventing us from taking meaningful action so they can continue to stay rich. And in the end whilst everyone suffers they simply can hide in their billionaire bunkers in New Zealand etc shielded from the worst impacts.

Remember the Ebola scare about 10 years ago? We all thought we were going to die horribly for about two weeks.

But then we didn't, it was contained, and then something like Covid happens and people think 'ah ah, you aren't fooling me again! Last time it didn't even make it to the US!' and forget that the only reason the Ebola outbreak didn't wipe us out is because of the fast actions of the same scientific community to contain it.

Which is exactly the type of thing people were saying in response to the Chinese and European scientists and hospital workers two years ago who were trying to warn us to take covid seriously.

But I think a basically face value interpretation is more applicable to the movie’s themes: here’s a guy who is at or near the top of his profession, his profession is fairly respected and undoubtedly important, and it’s by far one of the most straightforwardly *powerful* professions in the world. All that power and success, but he *still* has a need to feel just that *little* bit more powerful by jerking around these people who he sees as weaker.

It goes with Leo’s last, quite poignant, line in the movie:

“We really did have it all”


That’s the tragedy of global warming. We could have stopped it, and maybe still could, and *still* had everything worth having, but everyone always wanted more.",rcyqse

It’s all about the military industrial complex.",rcyqse
hq8zybp,"I think it is just straightforwardly something that happened to someone once.  I once was a guest of a billionaire in his box seats when a teen as a favor to his brother who I had done some menial work for, and the billionaire sent us a bill for the sodas we drank.  A bunch of 17-20 year olds.",rcyqse

hq3izs6,"I think it was more like “why would someone go out of their way to inconvenience me when I’m just going to find out that’s what he did”. It’s a subtle reflection of the film’s larger themes. People causing problems almost intentionally, people being deliberately awful in plain view without hesitation, abusing power for no reason even when they know they’ll be found out etc",rcyqse
hq6jy0m,He wrote it so well because it would always sound as if she's talking about something else much more serious and it ends up just being the snacks again lol,rcyqse

hqs31k0,"I think it was a shot at Flynn. She said something about ""he didn't need to do that, he knew I'd find out, was it just for power?"" which Flynn and the Q stuff seems to fit. Plus that dude was a 3\* general.",rcyqse
hr8691f,Or maybe he just likes to prank. Like the fart story to oglethorpe. And said he actually pulled it off. Thats his charm. But a young woman like Kate would overthink yeah. Everyone might actually. Funny bit.,rcyqse

hpz4eqh,"But that smartness came across with Blanchett's character.

She may play a bubbly idiot revelling in ignorance, but she's the smartest out of all of them; she's just realised that the quickest and easiest way to wealth is to give people what they want.

I've often thought about that - why do I put in hard graft to make things that work and help people, when there are people playing video-games for a living making several orders of magnitude more than my salary? Maybe I'm deluding myself by insisting that there's a moral component to it, and I ought to try and be useful to others.

If you're willing to grift, life is so much easier.",rcyqse

I really liked seeing the difference between when she told off Leo for trying to talk to her about her relationship — it really isn’t his business, he doesn’t know her and didn’t know anout her or her relationship until 36 hours before — and then going on air and getting sucked into doing that when she really just wanted to promote her single but got forced into a pretty fucking private moment on air. And then she listens to scientists and uses her power to try and get people to listen to them in the way she can. Sure, she isn’t a doctoral candidate but she is still making pretty smart decisions.",rcyqse

hq5le8a,"Oh, my mind totally went away for a walk when the song started. It was even a little cringeworthy - it felt like the movie was taking itself seriously with its own ""celebrities pretending to care about real stuff"". Like if Grande's characters turned her silliness for good this time. But how can such a bad music, in such a cynic display of using tragedy for vanity, be good? Maybe the movie was trying to play this joke straight, I don't know, but the whole editing was telling me I was supposed to be moved by it. Felt like a contractual requirement from Grande or something. Still loved the movie, but that scene was off.",rcyqse
hr7s9a7,"too funny. taking shots at celebs who hop on the latest social bandwagon. ""Fuck the manatees""",rcyqse

So happy the picked Cudi! He’s proven his comedy chops before, but Ariana was really funny.

Almost everything in the White House was hilarious. Meryl hugging Clinton like one of the Epstein photos, there was one with her and Mariah Carey too. Basically showing how shallow she was. 

But yeah go back and watch the background. The meta jokes in the movie are off the charts",rcyqse

hpvw0y1,"The President and her staff initially rejected the claims as being fallible and incorrect. They later downplayed its severity while showing that they were committed to rectifying the situation which they allowed to worsen. The leadership then transitioned towards downplaying its severity even more (which the media did as well) by claiming that they could control and manipulate the event in order to turn it into a beneficial one. They went as far as claiming that those who weren't in line were being alarmist and manipulative, thus the slogan ""Don't Look Up,"" or ""don't pay attention to these alarmists who are manipulating you with false or misleading information. We are doing right by you. You just have to listen to us.""


The ""Just Look Up"" was likewise a direct challenge by stating that the other group was blatantly lying about the severity of the situation, and seemingly purposely mishandling it. It was a slogan literally saying ""look at the facts staring at you in the face, rather than what these people are telling you to believe""


I found the two slogans to be perfectly in line with how their thought processes and coping strategies evolved. This happens every day in real life. It's what one of the favorite services of  media/image consulting firms



If you think either slogan in the movie is stupid and nonsensical, then you should look at most slogans that exist in the real world as being the same because being short, simple, and easy to say/remember while getting the point across is exactly what most slogans are built for",rcyqse
hpzqpxo,"I found that super-realistic. We already have similar mixed messaging about climate change and Covid. People will outright call it a hoax in one breath and claim that actually their politician/party/whoever have got it handled. Horse medicine and bleach will cure the virus that doesn't exist. The planet isn't warming at all, and actually it's a good thing that it is.  


Internal consistency and coherence simply doesn't matter next to ""owning the libs"". I too would call that point unrealistic, if I didn't see it every fucking day in real life.",rcyqse

Fact that you are mad at fact that Movie touches politics, which will be always the case if you think about it, just shows how limited their view is thus events of this movie could happend 1:1.

Fact is: rich and powerful people in movie destroy world by being greedy and same is happening right now. Regular people who just wanna eat dinner with their family are getting fucked by people who will survive no matter what and we are to blame coz we allow then to do that, just like in movie people keep supporting them untill its to late.

It was as if McKay couldn't even trust the people that understood the problem and agreed with the message to even begin to understand what the problem was.

Pretty sure the point of the movie was not to attack one particular side, but more to show how communication has completely broken down in our world. It’s impossible to distinguish the real/important facts from the noise, and random celebrity bullshit takes precedence over a world-ending event.

It would also require cooperation and giving away some of the tech to other countries to implement instead of clinging to patents to squeeze out every last dime of profit. It's not that we don't have the resources for a quality standard of living for everyone and changing our energy infrastructure would lower it further, it's that massive amounts are being hoarded at the top.

Malcolm Gladwell delves into how subtle satire doesn't work to enact change on Revisionist History. He takes the example of the British satirical figure Loadsamoney who was created to make fun of the rich. Being a working class man who finds his fortune Loadsamoney spends lavishly and looks down on the class he was once a part of.

The problem being is that those who were being made fun of loved Loadsamoney, he was seen as being a figure that represented ""both sides"". Gladwell also talks about Stephen Colbert and how popular he has been with both Democrats and Republicans because both sides see him as taking the piss out the other.

The last two years in this pandemic told me that I’m completely right, but it also weirdly gave me some comfort. In the end, if I at least try to stop the destruction, I know that I at least gave it my all. If we really are gonna slow walk off to great destruction, at least I can prepare myself. Climate change, Kessler syndrome, nuclear war, pandemic, famine are all very realistic and interconnecting issues that the world could face in the next century. It’s just important that we look up and try to resist the urge to accept that they are inevitable. The movie’s society may be representative of too many people on Earth, but that doesn’t mean humanity has to remain this stupid. We can build a better, more unified humanity. We just need to embrace that rationalism and selflessness should be the basis for our society. We have to keep in mind that every decision we have will effect those that will descend from us for eternity. What world do we want to leave them? Will we even leave a world for them? We’re a rational and intelligent species when we want to be. If we stopped thinking for our own individual greed and bias for one moment, then we could maybe build a glorious global community that could tackle these threats? The most important part of this movie is that we collectively as a species get to decide the planet we live in. We have technology that would make us gods compared to our ancestors. The real question is how do we use it. What type of beings do we want to be for our planet? We can accomplish anything we set our mind to do.

They repeatedly insisted the Ivy Leaguers should be relied on, not these mere astronomers. It was never stated directly in the movie, and you had to figure it was just the idiot President & son grasping at straws because they didn't want to believe they were doomed, but it also was a sly dig at all the Ivy League types and how they seem to slide into positions of power wherever they go. You got a vague sense that President and her failson believed the Ivy Leaguers were ""their scientists"" who would give them the results they wanted to hear, an even nastier dig.

I think most of the critics just whiffed on this one. On every level.

I think your notion that the critics whiffed in large part because they concentrated more on the delivery and not at all on the message is true nonetheless, but maybe not the whole story. And you're right, the critics behaved EXACTLY like the politicians and media types in the movie did, ignoring the message and focusing only on how it was delivered. The basic message of climate change is, ""If we don't get a handle on this NOW there's a good chance that ALL of our grandchildren are gonna die."" It's a scary message, and people are ignoring it. This movie attempts to show how dumb that approach is. And the moviegoers, by and large, seems to have Gotten It. The question is, why didn't the critics? Have they grown so isolated in their little media bubbles that they don't get that some movies can't be judge purely on aesthetic grounds? 

It has long been my theory that most movie critics are made different just by the basics of being a critic: they watch a lot more movies than the rest of us, and they also watch a lot of movies in genres that they don't personally like because they're critics and it's their duty. Most moviegoers only watch films they have a pretty good idea that they will like. It's a fundamental divide between critics and fans. But this movie is a satire, the sort of thing critics tend to like. They all say it's too heavy-handed, but audiences didn't get that at all. I think it might be because regular people are more scared of climate change than movie critics, especially given the ignorance and grotesque incompetence we see in Congress and the White House, in both parties. Most movies either ignore climate change or trivialize it. This movie sure didn't. This movie felt like a breath of fresh air to me.

ho5vm7u,"You can show love and humanism without any reference to God or anything mystical. I think it would have been more moving and powerful to show that love and whatnot does not come from anything spiritual, but those concepts are strictly human emotions. Would have drove home the point that what's good about humanity is each other, and that the bad parts of humanity come from our false beliefs that something divine exists or cares about us. How even in spite of certain death, what mattered wasn't thanking some god that doesn't exist for love, bravery, etc., but that we give each other those things through our actions, they don't come from anything or anywhere else. The nihilistic aspect would have shown that the only thing that matters is our actions, and we can choose to be loving and kind, or choose to be ignorant and spiteful, and how religion fosters the worst of humanity by passing the buck to something that doesn't exist.

The end scene of >!them just being thankful for each other at dinner, sharing food and wine, telling stories about their happiest times would have shown the best of humanity, but it got deluded with fake prayers as though it's god or spirit that is responsible for the positive aspects of humanity, when really it's spirituality that is responsible for the ""Don't look up"" crowd.!< How religion is just a form of delusion.",rcyqse

hpxzpnc,"I am not a writer so all I can tell you is what worked and didn't work for me. The main problem this movie has is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. Doesn't want to be a parody of the ridiculousness of the modern society and politics like the Idiocracy or does it want to be a chilling portrayal of ignorance winning over science like Contact, it tries to be both and unfortunately it fails at both. The movie starts serious and then they have the meeting with the president, I am like that's bit on the nose but whatever, but then they go to the talk show where the hosts aggressively talk over and talk down the scientists and I realized ""oh okay, this is liberal porn"" and from then the plot is painfully predictable. And it's fine if in a comedy a movie is predictable, but here the movie tries to do both and it just falls apart. A lot of jokes don't land and when it finally manages to land few jokes in a row it goes back to serious and realistic stuff, like all the stuff with Leo's wife, and it just kills the mood again. The movie actively works against itself by not making it's mind what it wants to be.

And as far as CMV I don't think the movie really distributes the blame, it's mostly just ""republicans bad, liberals good"", with a few minor stuff, like showing that tech billionaires are actually bad guys (who liberals until like 2020 practically worshipped, most of reddit still has hard on for Elon). It doesn't really show how most neoliberal solutions to climate change just paper over the cracks without really tackling the issue at it's core. Though I am not sure how would you portray in a movie about a comet, and I am not saying it would have made movie any better or worse. I just wanted to address your point, I don't think critics (who I secretly have maga hats at home) who disliked the movie have done so because they felt attacked or blamed.

At the end of the movie the family sits around and Leo says ""We've done everything we could"" and it almost felt like makers of the movie absolving themselves of the blame. But did you really done everything you could? You had a star-studded cast any movie has had this year and large enough budget to shoot all those scenes. If you wanted to convince people to take action against climate change, to become politically active, to understand the seriousness of the situation, then you should have made a different movie. If you wanted to make a comedy about the grotesqueness of modern society and politics then you should have made a different movie. I wish this movie was successful at what it was trying to do, maybe it will convince some people, in which case great, but I can't help but feel like this was a big missed opportunity.",rcyqse

Others may see him as Dr Fauci meets Carl Sagan mixed with a super Aspergers version of Elon Musk and Bill Gates. In a way the character Streep plays(holy crap she looks great still) feels at first like a parody of the typical 90s movie president but then goes full ""MAGA"" by the end which is perfect. The ""Dont look up"" crowd  scenes is so spot on toward the end, parodying the MAGA/Qanon folks. Leo's character selling out for Apple like commercials is also so tone perfect. Strangely I hated Mckays movie ""Vice"" despite hating the Bush presidency, something felt off with that one. Of the post Will Ferrel/John C Reilly comedy era, of all his ""Big Short"" era I feel Dont Look Up is Mckays magnum opus. Sadly Jonah Hill isn't in the movie much, but I did love Tyler Perry and Timothy Chalamet's characters.

But as time has gone forward its no more dangerous than the flu, though that in itself is a big killer too.

hq33w94,"I worked at the Onizuka Center for International Astronomy Maunakea Visitor Information Station for a few years. 

We had nightly stargazing sessions with several high powered telescopes for the public to look through, and I used a laser pointer to give a guided tour of the night sky, pointing out constellations, planets, stars, distant galaxies, and other things, depending on what was visible that night.

I worked with the observatories on the summit, including Gemini, Keck, and Subaru (Keck and Subaru were featured in the movie), to help the public understand and appreciate the astronomy and astrophysics research being performed. 

I would show people the Andromeda Galaxy and explain it was two-and-a-half million light years away.

I legit had a woman respond with ""but if the universe is only six thousand years old, how can the light have travelled that far?""

'well, this would be evidence that the universe is older than six thousand years'

""Hmmm... I don't know about that""

Had a younger guy, early 20's, ask me

""If the world is round, how come the water doesn't fall off at the equator? Like, how does it stick to the underside?""

Always, some poor, ignorant, uneducated person, as young as high schoolers to older boomers, asking questions that could be answered by paying attention to primary school science or watching Bill Nye, or, like the first example I gave, answered themselves.

Occasionally, they would ask a *good* question, only to dismiss the answer if it clashed with preconceived notions.

'how can you tell the distance to things like the Andromeda Galaxy, or things too close for there to be cosmological redshift?'

'for that, we use type Ia supernovae. Because of how they happen, effectively, they are all twins. So by looking at how bright or dim they are, they're used as 'standars candles', and we can tell how far away they are'

'Hmm.... I don't know about that'

And that's when you realize they had pulled a question from some anti science Facebook page that was used to 'stump' a straw man, and not an actual question a scientist couldn't answer.

The overall energy level reaching the planet might be the same, but the impact might be significantly diluted.

Regarding the size of the comet - 10 km is not small, but its not overly huge either. Yes, its about the same one that killed the dinosaurs, but the mechanics of that are not even all that well understood. 

The heat flash from atmospheric ignition, while dangerous, will only last a few hours - easily enabling anyone with some preparation time to survive. Assuming the 6 months prior to comet impact were spent preparing underground bunkers and vaults for people, you could easily preserve millions of people in those vaults for a few days. Basically any insulated shelter will prevent deaths caused by the heat flash. 

Tsunamis - as you said - will only affect people living within a few miles of the coasts - although most of the high population cities falls within that range, with a 6 month lead time, you could have a significant chunk of population migrate to areas where the tsunamis would not be a threat. 

Realistically, the short ice age that follows due to the ash and dust particles in the sky will be the biggest of humanity's worries - to combat that you'd either have to prepare underground farms running on nuclear power or breed edible food that either does not rely on sun for its nutrients, or can work off significantly reduced solar availability (like 20% of the usual).",rcyqse

In contrast, the shuttle/ICBM plan was self-sabotaged from the start. The president specifically points out that they need a ""hero"" (fat Ron Pearlman) and the shuttle is obviously decorated for patriotism. However, neither are what the task at hand requires.

As far as it's political messages go, as someone that is neither a republican or democrat, I was hoping for a satire that captured the whole picture and absurdity of both sides that a lot of people like me have witnessed as more neutral viewers of the political spectrum. Instead it took a more holier than thou more to one sided message. I honestly think they could have taken the satire much much farther but they limited themselves with its own bias. It almost felt self serving I guess? Alot of preaching to the choir so to speak.

That's kind of what I got out of it. I am sure if you are of the crowd that it heavily pandered to then I am sure it would have been more enjoyable as a form of confirmation and it would be easier to jump on board with and forgive it's shortcomings.

I was trying to say, or should have said, I understand if NPR or anybody else wants to criticize the movie for some of its flaws. But instead they criticized it for political reasons!

""Climate change is really complicated!"" this idiot on NPR kept saying. It's really not. It's life or death. It's now or never. And NPR's ""enlightened centrism"" is going to get *billions* of people killed just so that they don't piss off their centrist donors.

They would have been better off not reviewing at all than to trash it for bullshit political reasons, IMO.

It just made me realize what they really are and how bullshit they are. There are so few media outlets we can trust at all anymore, really almost none. Even for a ""nonprofit"" company, the dollar drives all decisions and ends up corrupting any kind of real truth-seeking or truth-telling.

hqlxeht,"You are right. Biden tried a little bit. But it was far too little, far too late, and removing the teeth from the climate change proposal in the BBB was the very first thing that coal monger Manchin shut down. He would only agree to positive financial rewards for green energy and made them remove any actual regulations or fines *as his very first move*.

And then, as we all know, he had no intention of passing the rest of it anyway.

I hope that he has grandchildren, and I hope that on his deathbed, he realizes the horrors that he has sentenced them to through his greed and apathy.

But you are right, Biden has done more than most presidents (and Trump has for sure been the worst). But at the end of the day, the reason why Biden/Obama won't go after climate change with any real vigor is because they are beholden to their corporate donors.

Because even what passes for the ""left"" in mainstream American politics would barely be the ""center right"" in Europe. And somehow, nobody but the ""far left"" in America seems to care if the world is uninhabitable in a few hundred years (or sooner).

""But what about the jobs the comet will bring??"" the center keeps asking us.",rcyqse
hqmhoat,NPR is honestly fine overall even if they just had a really bad take on this movie.,rcyqse
hqlvxqh,"It's really more ""enlightened centrist"" than right-wing.

One of those funny and horrible things where as the right-wing pulls into full-on totalitarianism, the center gets pulled further to the right.

And NPR is usually not even too far to the center, but the way that their hosts just attacked this movie ""when climate change is such a complicated issue"" just reeked of tonedeaf privilege.

If you were to ask them ""why"" they think climate change is a complicated issue, they say the same thing as the people in the movie that we were supposed to oppose: ""well, think about the economy and the jobs!""

I just hate ""enlightened centrism.""

The movie addressed that too with the brilliant Chris Evans scene ""I say look up *and* down"" as if that makes sense or solves the problem!

It's like a joke I have heard lately attacking ""enlightened centrists"" who think we shouldn't go so hard on the new rise of right-wing neonazism: ""Hey guys, what if we compromise and just do *a little genocide*?""

On some issues ""the middle"" is not a sane position, is all I am trying (poorly!) to say. Just ""doing a little genocide"" isn't enough. Just ""caring a little"" about climate change/the comet isn't enough.

NPR just pisses me off lately that they try to walk the line of supposedly being woke, but really they always side with the corporate politicians and end up pulling that ""let's just do a little genocide""/""climate change is way too complicated"" bullshit.

I am not saying both sides are the same. I am a hard leftist. But shills like NPR are what is killing the left. Biden's middle-of-the-road-ism.

The fact that you won't wake up to this is what is killing the left.

Say it with me now: *They. Don't. Care. About. Us.*

The global reaction wouldn’t resemble anything like what is seen in the movie, in my estimation. 

The analogy being made in the film, is patently absurd. Climate change is a much slower process, and far more abstract in the minds of most people. Humans are naturally not very good at long term risk assessment. What scientists would actually want, is for people to react to climate change data, as they would if there was an immediate extinction event threat like an asteroid or comet heading our way.

Looking at a streamer is like looking at a professional soccer player and saying “why didn’t I do that?” Well everyone tries and very few people succeed, most of them make less money than you think, their careers don’t usually last very long, and something could happen that might end their career at any moment, either because of scandal/injury or just because the way the game’s played changed and their skills aren’t as valuable. 

I doubt streamers work as hard as soccer players but still a lot of work goes into it varying by channel. Working a normal job has a bunch of benefits against it. Feeling morally accomplished is definitely one of them but it’s not the only thing. It’s never a good idea to compare yourself against the most successful in another field. You should compare yourself to the average or equivalent level as your field. The vast majority of streamers have other jobs because they can’t make enough money to support themselves. 

Don’t disabuse the perks of job security and stable income. When you are grifting you will be up against a bunch of other grifters always looking to out grift you.

An example being the fbi over the head gag. In a properly written movie, that would be a one line kick, with maybe a face from j law.

Or they (I) thought the movie was way too long and tonally inconsistent, with satire that's way too broad, but even worse, not clever or funny. The performances are great, but the characters are flat and their personal stories (the stuff that should be emotional) take a back seat to McKay beating you over the head with his edgy, cynical satire that feels like it's written by someone who would look like Timothée Chalamet's character.

Also, it's been a long time since a film's editing has legitimately irritated me this much. I can't stand McKay's faux-documentary style. So many random cutaways and pointless closeups that add nothing but distraction. The amount of times scenes would transition while a character is speaking was egregious.

I think the design is to be so blatant because there's just this overwhelming dread of holy shit holy shit, roe v Wade is about to be overturned, our court system has been filled with conservative sycophants, districts gerrymandered to shit, and the there is no happy ending anymore.  It's a dark comedy that reflects the dark state of affairs we're in.



Conservatives never needed ammunition, they were outraged at a tan suit for Christs sake you know what I mean?  The hate for liberals on the conservative end has been a play in motion for decades at this point.  



I think the debate for how to address climate change for example is not simple but the fact that conservative politicians refuse to believe it's real is exactly why the movie is so point blank because that's what our reality is today.

Yet it was still personal. It drew you in, made you really reflect on a sociopathic bureaucracy, and all the while it made you laugh too. Not only that, the ending stung. It was a brutal and harsh pang of reality

This movie just didn't have that grip. Decent movie, just not as good as it could have been, and The Big Short outshines it. Maybe I'm comparing apples to oranges",rcyqse

Respectfully, look at yourself and ask yourself if anything I’ve said is true. Yeah there are tons of Covid denying/Fox News idiots out there who I despise - but the other extreme are people who just shout “all Republicans evil, Biden is a saint that can do no wrong” which just cuts off any rational discourse or discussion (I’m not a Republican and also voted for Biden btw)",rcyqse

It wasn't global warming to me (not to say it wasn't about it, I just didn't think of that specifically when watching) as much as it was just ""yeah, we're fucked if something like this happens"".

Covid is a gigantic clusterfuck that shows how entirely dysfunctional our (at least American) society is, whereas I thought this movie was more about greed and willful ignorance towards actually settled science (aka climate change)",rcyqse

Even if you managed to take 100% of all their net worth without them leaving and liquidated it all at cost (big maybes for both) that would cover 4 years of the current U.S. budget deficit before any new spending. 

So you don't have the new money to implement these technologies. And that doesn't count the trillions to implement it. And btw all of that is just for the United States. That doesn't count the need for someone to subsidize India, Africa, etc. in reducing their emissions as they modernize otherwise it'll never happen and they don't have it themselves. 

We're nowhere near fucked if we don't do it. Current forecasts are for business as usual warming to peak at roughly 3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century (according to Median estimates). A big problem? Yes. The end of life as we know it? Definitely not. Will the average American see a noticeable change ""or fuck up life"" likely not. Will the average African already on the brink? Probably. 

In reality (as someone who's done research in the field), the single largest thing we can do to combat emissions isn't fund solar in the U.S. or EV infrastructure. It's to fund international projects in developing nations to avoid new emission sources. The Grand Inga Dam and Kra Canal together both have the potential to reduce emissions significantly. Increased nuclear power in the United States instead of coal could also have a large impact as could LNG instead of coal in Africa.",rcyqse

I mean, I checked the timestamp at one point, thinking that the movie was half over, but there was still a feature length film left. Pretty crazy. Especially because comedies, particularly contemporary ones, very often have a third act problem. Either the plot isn't enough to fill the time and the stretching is dull or it just becomes progressively less funny as things wrap up and that makes it dull. I didn't get that with this. Maybe the ticking clock nature of the story kind of helped with that, but overall, I thought that it was an excellently structured film.

No, the criticism leveled at the film is overwhelmingly due to it being as subtle as a kick in the teeth and that it's preaching to the choir to such a degree that it's just condescending, even to people who agree with the message. The pacing and plot was also a mess.

>Some basic principles that we stick to as a bit of a generalisation is - state the conclusion first (or the ""key takeaways"") and then present the supporting evidence.

That's how scientific communications work too. Most publication abstracts will start by stating the conclusion followed by a tiny summery how they reached that and why it's important. What Leo's character initially lacked, much like a lot of science people, is eye to eye communication with clear enunciation *infront of an audience*.

The ""customer is always right"" mindset that dominates our society has the burden fall entirely on the one doing the talking. But some topics just can't be breached without effort on the part of the listener. And in this case, the topic was also highly emotional for *entirely justified reasons*, and simply going ""nah, won't listen if you keep bitching!"" was actually detrimental. Everyone's in control mainly of their own actions. If you're the one talking, talk well. But if you're the one listening, listen well, and make up for what the other may be lacking. And if the topic is important but complex, don't demand the complexity to disappear. It may be superfluous, but sometimes, it's actually really core to the issue.

If the pilots adjust their language and begin speaking directly to the children, instead of each other, there are better outcomes available. Right now, we have scientists talking to scientists, talking to researchers, while also having not-scientists and not-researchers such as platformed media, politicians, business, etc actively fighting to lessen the message, change it entirely, etc.

When the world faces a crisis different countries react differently. This is made apparent how European Countries are more likely to adopt more environmentally friendly policies compared to USA.

This has nothing to do with it being an extremely black comedy. I get that. Most reviewers get that. People are trying really hard to make people who didn't like the movie 'get it'. My issue is that I think it poorly executed what it was trying to do because of poor writing and editing. 

Reminded me of how I feel about, 'Sorry to Bother You' which was altogether fine, but tried way too hard to make sure everyone really got it, to such an extent that the process of 'getting it' got in the way of the movie presenting its ideas

Writing was horrendous, similar to the point above, but as you watch more critically acclaimed films, you realize that each and every line is masterfully utilized, and there's not much **redundancy** in the **sentiment** you're trying to get across in a scene. You say one or two lines and get your point across succinctly so you can progress the story, the humor, or the character. When Jonah Hill admitted that he had fbi put the bag over j laws head, that should have absolutely been a one line moment. Just as j law is walking out, Jonah should look at her and say 'I did the fbi thing' and she should flip him off and that's it. **instead** we had like four lines of dialog dedicated to that gag.

The movie deliberately portrayed the two mains as confused and discombobulated with the way everything progressed from their initial call with the NASA administrator.

The gravity of their discovery caused them to contact NASA, as NASA would not only have access to the resources required to perform a peer review, but also the resources to actually do something about the problem assuming it was real.

They weren't expecting to be connected from bureaucrat to bureaucrat and forced to get on a military charter flight the very same night. 

All that said, they mention many times after the initial hush-hush chapter of the film that the data has been peer reviewed by virtually every institution capable and is entirely irrefutable. Even if they don't really show the peer review or accurately describe how one takes place, it doesn't really detract much from the movie for me.

hql721d,">The as you say ""private enterprise"" solution (I don't like that phrasing but for clarity I'll stick with it) didn't try to break the laws of physics unlike the space shuttle/ICBM plan.

Okay this movie very clearly isn't about physics and orbital mechanics. The federal government's mission was going to work, or at least it had the greatest possible chance of working.

There is no spacecraft available that could deflect a 10km asteroid with only a few months notice. If we detected an asteroid that large and it was 6 months from impact the only feasible solution would be a nuclear strike.

>They were able to actually rendezvous with the comet and touch down. The failures were due to not properly reviewing and testing which while catastrophic in the movie is not insurmountable.

No, the failures in the BASH mission were **catastrophic and fundamental.** Kinetic energy is very simple E = (1/2)mv^(2). It's a function of mass and velocity squared. The BASH mission was going to allow the entire asteroid to impact earth, but in 13 or so pieces. This does not dissipate any of the asteroids energy, it's still the same mass traveling at the same velocity just in 13 pieces rather than one. It would have been equally catastrophic even if their mission went off without a hitch from a logistical/technical standpoint.

That's why they made a point of Kate and Dr. Mindy saying there's no safe way to bring the asteroid to earth. Because there wasn't. It was a fundamentally flawed plan, which the wealthy tech oligarchs overlooked because they were salivating over the potential profits.

This is the crux of the film's analogy to climate change. There is no safe or sustainable way to continue extracting and burning fossil fuels, any scientist with half a brain could tell you that. But wealthy oligarchs are hell bent on continuing to do so because of the profits.

>In contrast, the shuttle/ICBM plan was self-sabotaged from the start. The president specifically points out that they need a ""hero"" (fat Ron Pearlman) and the shuttle is obviously decorated for patriotism.

Ron Pearlman's character had **literally no bearing on the progress or success of the mission,** aside from his racist ramblings symbolically tarnishing the mission. The was the whole point, that politicians love to grand stand and flex for public approval even when they're doing the right thing.

>Why do you think the film showed the ""private enterprise"" solution was more successful (or at least was closer to not failing) than the shuttle/ICBM plan?

It wasn't more successful!  The ICBM mission was going to be successful, it was literally the only possible shot at successfully mitigating the asteroid. The film portrays the mission as though it is going to succeed. The scientist protagonists fully support the mission. IT WAS GOING TO WORK.

Why didn't it work? Because the Bash CEO pulled the president aside and told her to call off the mission because they discovered immense mineral wealth on the asteroid.

The mission failed precisely because of private enterprise interfering in an attempt to secure lucrative profits.

Even with the colony ship, they could have staffed it with more qualified and fit individuals other than the crusty old lobbyists that supported Orlean. But they didn't because the point here is to satirize how irrational the world of ""Dont Look Up"" is, and how selfishly stupid Orlean and Ishwell are in handling such a crisis.

Steel and concrete production produce a ton (metric ton, 1000kg) of CO2 for a ton of material (steel/concrete). If we can get that to say, 750kg of CO2 per 1000kg of steel, we'd save a BILLION tons of CO2 per year.

""Stop the car"". Do you realize what that means? I'm not being condescending, i have no life experience at all. I'm 18 and studying engineering. 

But stop the car means stopping steel production in this case. Stopping building power plants. Stopping everything the world runs on. Stopping hospitals and schools being built.

I'm really sorry, but most of the world is still poor as fuck. Stopping the car means billions will die. I can't watch that happen. I'd rather drive the car straight into a mountain. 

If you find this distressing or if you find me unempathetic, i'm very sorry. We simply cannot afford to stop the car. If we do, half the planet will be dead anyway, and then saving the world is a moot point.",rcyqse

If an actual asteroid was announced to be heading to earth i have no doubt in my mind that politics (like actual geopolitical issues, not the current use for the word) and negationists would really throw a wrench into a plan that is already hard enough to pull off

For example i can see one nation shooting down another's attempt at stopping the asteroid because they want to take the moral highground and ""be the heroes"" justifying their shootdown by saying that it was gonna fail and make it worse (which is actually the case if your plan was to just nuke the asteroid)

This is why I wish they would’ve done a twist on the dumb ditzy pop star trope.

However that would require giving Ariana Grande more screen time, and she probably only agreed to that cameo and song.

Side note:
I know you said AFAIK but she is actually heavily involved in her creative process, though more composing/producing than lyrics.

The banality of celebrities, morning news, clickbait, and Tik Tok is inconsequential in the face of the impending Armageddon. Pearl-clutching about dumb social media trends or vapid talk shows doesn’t do anything about the comet/climate crisis. Similarly, IMO, Meryl Streep’s character reads too literally as a gender-swapped Trump, right wing politics, dumbass kids, and red hats included. She can’t touch the real life buffoonery of Trump, which (to me) made her gags pale imitations of his batshit behavior. Worse, by skewering Trump specifically, the movie allows anyone center and leftward to feel smug about supporting more superficially competent politicians who pay lip service to the need for action but never seem to actually act. All of us have failed and we have been failed by decades of leadership across the political map.

On the balance, I really liked the movie. The scientists at its heart (plus the skater boy and Mindy’s family) felt real and whole and fallible and sincere, whereas many of the characters were weak amalgams of or analogues to public personalities. The best dark humor came from the moments the actors were allowed to play humans (the running joke about Kate being not able to get over the general charging her for snacks) instead of satirical archetypes. 

I just wish that the whole movie had the courage of the last 30 minutes. Yeah, some people don’t pay attention, they don’t accept the science, they are too selfish and too stupid to care, and they don’t even try to stop the threat. Yadda yadda, that’s just the daily news. That’s all about those *other* people. But I’ll think about the end of the movie for a long time. I found it a really poignant cry of despair and rage and hopelessness.

I know a lot of liberals who think all we need to do to meet climate change is to stop coal (but they don't have to lower their electrical usage), drive electric (ignoring the mining and power generation issues), tax really rich people (but don't raise their taxes), and eat organic (which actually uses more land and resources).

Basically the film IMHO is just a feel good story so middle and upper middle class liberals can feel good about how they aren't part of the problem, while doing nothing to actually stop climate change, because they feel that they are not part of the problem. 

Consumerism is a HUGE issue with climate change, but tell people that suburbs are unsustainable, that they should cut back their purchases by at least 50%, and that they should live in cities where cars are not needed and they loose their minds.

In my opinion the left in the US is just are almost bad (like 95% the same) as the right **when it comes to climate change** (they are super different in other ways of course) because they refuse to even think about what really needs to be done. They want to do things, but only if it doesn't effect them personally.

Other nations would likely be nervous to make an alt plan against the US for fear of stepping on toes.

Doesn't alter the fact that food production isn't oriented around actually feeding people, but by creating maximal profit.   


We have the technology and resources to implement it, but not under a private profit driven model. If our actual objective was raising quality of life by eliminating diseases and common parasites, providing housing, food running water, electricity, education, etc., we could do it. We could do it to a degree that wouldn't meaningfully lower the living standard of the developed world. And we could do it without fossil fuels (a sizeable amount of geothermal and nuclear laying down a baseload for a whole lot of decentralized solar, wind, and hydro with a vast array of energy storage technologies). We could do all that if that if solving problems and improving quality of life were our actual priority. But it isn't. Obscene amounts of resources and labor power are wasted in squeezing ever more profit into private hands.

And I'd agree that funding alternative to new emission sources in developing countries is vital. And I'd say that goal requires ditching certain concepts of intellectual property law and giving away tech if we want it to actually be used. We can't be repeating this patented vaccine bullshit.

I’ve been to Cuba the standard of living is way worse and the only reason it is anywhere is because they export doctors who get paid very well on capitalist societies.

It's not Adam McKay's job to solve the climate crisis, he's showing that the people in power who are causing this crisis and who's responsibility it actually is to fix the crisis are doing nothing to do so, and the film extends that line of thinking out and says ""hey, if we don't act now, this is what's going to happen.""

This is a black comedy/satire. Adam McKay is not the authority on how to solve climate change. Honestly, having a hopeful ending or including ideas to solve climate change would absolutely ruin this movie. They even make fun of in the movie itself how no one wants to listen to qualified people and would rather listen to politicians and the media who don't know shit about how to stop a comet. Including ideas on how to solve the crisis would do the exact thing the film is criticizing: encourage people to listen to non-experts on issues that need expert opinion.

What Adam McKay is doing as a filmmaker is saying ""hey, scientists have made it very clear this is a problem. The people in charge need to listen to the scientists and start doing something about it or we are fucked"" and this film gets it's message across perfectly about that.

After typing this whole response out, I've realized that you definitely aren't getting the point of the movie. Sorry if that's abrasive. It's fine to not like the film, but to ask it to do the exact thing it's satirizing/critiquing makes no sense.

In the movie i think it is described as 5-10km which is smaller than the one that killed the dinosaur. Although the movie does also say it's bigger so you know. However, I saw something from a Astronomer that says you'd need a 50-60 mile wide one to completely wipe out all life with no chance of a come back.
Obviously you don't want to be around for it but we know life survived that impact, albeit almost all large animals were killed off in impact and resulting winter,  so no reason to assume all animals, plants or even humans would be wiped out. Getting off world for a couple thousand years and returning to a planet you basically know seems much safer to me than shooting off to the starts.
Hell in the movie Johan Hill seemingly survives the impact in the same hemisphere. If that was the actual case there would doubtless be millions of people surviving on the far side of world, especially if China/Russia/India or places in Europe stocked up in fallout shelters or mines etc to avoid effects of re entry ejecta. The resulting global winter would obviously be bad, as I understand it this is what killed off most of the dinosaurs the cold/destruction of food sources.

> I’m not sure if I actually have to say this, but one of the reasons there is a lot of misinformation about COVID and climate change is that it’s NOT as simple as “asteroid coming and will kill everyone in 6 month”

With Climate Change it absolutely is! What are you on about? We're talking unprecedented heat waves, rising ocean levels, the displacement of billions, and more common cataclysmic weather events if we do not end our reliance on fossil fuels. The response to COVID is also simple, mass testing and tracing, vaccinating, mask wearing, and isolating people who do catch it. Countries like China, New Zealand, Cuba, etc figured this out ages ago, but countries like the US and UK are incapable of doing these things due to a government that is so bought and broken that it can't adequately respond to mass emergencies.

> People obviously respond much more to immediate and visible/quantifiable threats, which is why terrorist attacks and natural disasters get more mobilization

Terrorist attacks like 9/11 got a quicker response because it could feed the US military industrial complex. If all it took was a terrorist attack to get a country to mobilize quickly the constant school shootings would've ended by now. If all it took for mobilization was a natural disaster Climate Change would be being adequately addressed by now.

**TL;DR:** curiosity about world religions had me understand that the idea of God wasn't necessarily irrational, that God wasn't necessarily evil, etc. Going foward, I started truly believing in God. Going even foward, my studies made me believe Christianity was not evil, like I used to think, that it was a religion like others, that it could be more or less close to truth like others are. Finally, a spiritual experience made me believe I belong in evangelicalism, in Christian communion, in looking for Jesus as my personal savior. In the middle of all that, being a father really opened my heart to love, specially to loving my neighbor.

\-

I don't know how the name ""evangelical"" rings in US or UK, but in Brazil it's a minority religion - it used to be small, then it has grown very fast in a few decades, and now evangelicals are something like 25% of the country. So, growing up, I was very prejudiced against those people - both their weird habits and their emphatical belief. I didn't like Christianity in general, but evangelicals had a very bad rep among the middle class, from where I came, of being naive, robbed by their pastors, unintellectual, loud, etc. But, from what I gather, in the US there is a liberal vs fundie issue that is largely regional - fundamentalists would be white folks from the countryside, right? In Brazil, we're talking black, brown and not-so-white people from the shantytowns and ""suburbs"" (not your suburbs, more like poor urban neighborhoods). It was way less a protest vs catholic thing (though it happened) and was very, very linked to class. Also, in Brazil, we have a contradictory situation with belief/rationality and prejudice: atheists suffer prejudice, but greater belief and ""superstition"" are seen as tipically a poor people thing. So, pentecostals churches with rigid customs, exorcisms and miraculous healings were not only judged by the lenses of rationality, but also by being very ""poor like"" in their beliefs. And they were expanding! I've seem the word ""cancer"" being used more than once.

So, after I was 18 or 19, I was exploring spirituality. Not that I was willing to believe in the supernatural, in the begining, but at home I had a very colourful education, and I was always curious about foreign religions. So I was looking after buddhism, hinduism, I was reading a lot. I was figuring a materialist onthology didn't make sense to me anymore (not that I knew these terms so long ago!) - that I liked to speak *as if* I was materialist but in reality that was not my experience in life. More fundamentally, I figured that if I was a real skeptic, I would doubt skepticism - as in, take those ""negative beliefs"" (X isn't real) I was so sure about and leave the question open for a while. That opened me up for more spiritual experiences, both regarding self-knowledge and mysticism. So, maybe there was something like a God, maybe not, but the God idea made sense, God making rules could make sense, God interfering on ""Earth"" could make sense. Even sexual morals could make sense, though I tooootally did not want to think too much about that. Going a little foward, I went to a ayahusca rite once (Santo Daime) and something really, really clicked. I could go to details in private, because it was a very private thing. I don't quite believe in Daime's theology, but I believe I had a legitimate experience with God. So I was convinced God was real and that he loved me.

I kept looking, reading, thinking. I was a father when I was 21 years old, which was an even greater door to feeling the enourmous size of life. It was like I understood what love was for the first time of my life - I thought, I never really loved my father, my mother, my siblings, my friends, my girlfriend - I only ever loved this little guy. So I went back, trying to love them as hard as I love my son. I understood every person on Earth deserved to be loved like I love my son, and I finally understood the deep and transcendental importance of a human life. About a year later, I had a JW coworker, a guy I loved very much, very wise Northeaster Brazilian dude, who like to talk about the Bible with me (I liked debating and learning any time) and also a neopentecostal coworker. By that time, I didn't think Christianity was an evil religion anymore, I thought it could be just as valid as the other expressions of faith and theology. I went once or twice to the evangelical coworker's church, and started going to house meetings, which we call ""cells"". One day, after a hymn, I closed my eyes and could feel God ""hugging"" me, I felt his embrace in a very spiritual, but not metaphorical way... as I opened my eyes, I saw everyone was in the same mood, and an elder member of that cell said, ""the Lord's Holy Ghost is incredible, isn't it?"" We were all feeling the same! So, it checked all my rational concerns. God is real, but He could be in any religion, maybe all - but He showed himself to me, in an event that wasn't only psychological, in an evangelical meeting. To me, it could only mean God wanted to show me my path to Him should be as an evangelical.

Politics is our *specialisation*. And we're fucking terrific at it, but also, it's sort of self-referential - it can only solve problems created by other humans (for a definition of ""solve"" that includes things like ""genocide""). 

Science is us finding out that we can sorta, kinda skew our various capabilities and aim them at something that they weren't meant for, and if we keep ourselves focused and on track with other humans keeping us in check, sometimes go somewhere that isn't up our own ass. But it's hard enough that very few people can do it well and some reject it altogether because it deeply feels *unnatural* to them - playing devil's advocate to my own ideas? Why would I do that?

The initial mission was to band together with other nations to tackle the issue. There was a moment when they were doing the right thing and had a planned mission put into motion in time to destroy the comet. Thematically this is the “best case scenario” for fighting climate change. People agree the threat is real, pull together and enact change while we still have the time. 

The whole thing is sidetracked when the billionaire throws his disproportionate level of authority over the democratic effort and they cancel the mission. This is the equivalent of Elon Musk trying to tackle the global problem/possible capital venture by throwing half baked ideas with lots of money and flashy, unproven tech and zero peer review, as co-operation could mean splitting the profits. 

Then the US pulls away from the joint effort, meaning the rest of the major powers try to do it on their own. The failure thematically represents that we can’t tackle climate change alone. If we rely on the billionaire to hoard the wealth while beta testing the most important solution needed to ensure human survival, absent of the rest of the world’s collaboration, we all fucked. 

Throwing in a possible subterfuge plot about the US stopping the rest of the world from making them rich doesn’t seem to fit in with the rest of the movie’s themes.

Climate change over time can absolutely lead to a complete removal of life. Over a long period of time? Yea, real long. But we know that a planet can decay to a point where nothing can live.  Again, coming back to inevitability. 

Knowing the outcome, and choosing to not course correct is the whole point of the movie. Its analogous to COVID and Climate Change.

The Ariane 5 launch was ESA's main contribution to James Webb.

James Webb is a distinctly NASA initiative, with involvment from ESA and Canada for the sake of international cooperation.

ESA and CSA's are junior partners for the project. They aren't equals to NASA.

The US could have undertaken the entire mission on it's own.

The US doesn't lack launch capabilities, and no other country possesses greater launch capability than America, just by SpaceX on it's own.

The US only lacked manned launch capability to the ISS and that was only for a relatively short period because the US didn't have a homegrown capsule after the Shuttle.

NASA initiated the James Webb program in the early 90s, many years before ESA and Canada even officially signed on to the program.

ESA's financial contribution to James Webb was US$810 million.
Canada US$160 million

This isn't some thinking movie, where it is taking itself or its subject matter seriously or subtlety.

People walking away from this film with any sort of revelation or insight into humanity, as though the film had invoked, or unlocked a new perspective of the world are either:

1. Extremely sheltered
2. Very young
3. Looking for any pedastal to stand atop of to circle jerk over their own wokeness

And before any panties get into bunches, I'm just saying that this movie cannot be designed or conveyed to be a 'thinking mans' movie, or having a deep message when it is so loudly ham fisted that if it were a book, and you were to open the inner flap, in giant bold letters it would say ""humans dumb, amirite? Updoots to the left!""

All that being said, I still lean back on my initial statements, the plot was fun, it's always cathartic to laugh at allegories of stupid people, especially when the parallels are so vividly seen in today's conservatives.

>people who didn't like this movie are the same group that 'wouldn't look up' 

That's just such an insanely presumptuous thing to say when the movie has **such obvious flaws** in the way that we **quantify if a movie is good or bad via acting, script, and pacing**, such as I've mentioned.

It's just so frustrating (and fascinating) how people on the left will do the **same** things as people on the right, such as ignoring flaws in a narrative, so long as it **fits** the narrative, and this is just a prime example of it. People are using a **bad movie** as a champion to lord over the people on the right (that would absolutely be a part of the 'don't look up crowd' but that doesn't mean you can't judge a movie on its own merits, because it's political. I've seen so many people mimic the:

>If you didn't like the movie, then you didn't understand it, because you're a part of the problem!

Rather what you mean is my views disagree with yours/your social media echo chamber, so therefore I’m being disingenuous.

Of course Trump handled the pandemic terribly, and of course tons of stuff (most of it) he said is completely moronic. But if it’s satire it has to be relatively accurate, at least IMHO - probably a better portrayal (in my personal view) would have had POTUS responding to it in an over the top (and maybe xenophobic) way, before thinking the threat wasn’t real. This just feels like McKay/Streep saying “Trump = stupid & evil” without any further content.

Now I’m sure you’ll just ignore everything I’ve said and call me (unfairly) a Trump lover. But I think satire fails if it’s just hitting people over the head with a sledge hammer. Also as much as I hate Trump, he’s clearly not a one-dimensional evil caricature as otherwise he wouldn’t have been elected President. Is he a stupid/bad/nasty guy? Yes. But to portray him as a one dimensional caricature means the satire misses the mark and fails to actually get to the core of the issue.

I just feel like McKay was going for the viewers like yourself who would laugh and shout along “Trump evil!” at the screen without any further thought as to how we ended up in this situation. Dismiss me all you want as disingenuous or whatever - but if we don’t address the problems/reasons for him being elected in 2016, don’t be surprised if someone else likes him wins in 2024. We were all just laughing at him as a caricature in 2016 - look how that turned out.

Contrast that to Vice - it showed Dick Cheney as a *nasty* piece of work, but it also showed *why* he got where he did, because he was also a strong leader in times of crisis (or appeared to be). I realize this wasn’t a Trump-focused film but given the Whitehouse caricature was a big part of it, I felt it was too in your face and therefore lost its meaning.

hq3v5w8,"In the 1400s, Martin Luther and other prominent European clergy led what's referred to today as the Protestant Reformation, a critique of Catholic practices and doctrine that led to the splitting of the Catholic Church, producing a number of denominations and religious movements. Today, many Protestant denominations can be characterized as ""evangelical."" 

Protestants generally are characterized by the five solas (latin for ""alone""): 

1. By scripture alone - the Bible, and not tradition or church teaching, contains all the knowledge needed to be a Christian,
2. By faith alone - people are saved from hell by their faith, and not by doing enough good things,
3. By grace alone - people are saved by the mercy of God, and not because they somehow earned their salvation,
 4. Christ Alone - priests are not needed to mediate between God and man,
5. Glory to God Alone - Mary, angels, or saints Re not to be worshipped, or venerated in ways that approach worship 

Evangelicals are protestants who are characterized by the following four focuses:

1. Biblicism - the Bible
2. Crucicentrism - the crucifixtion
3. Conversionism - making converts
4. Activism - living out one's faith in material, tangible, ways.",rcyqse

First was denial — both her and Dr. Mindy went through this upon their initial discovery. Dr. Mindy actually said something along the lines of ""This isn't real, this isn't happening"" while Kate decided to try and ignore the problem and get high. Next was anger — this comes up throughout the entire movie, but the clearest examples were probably in the White House meeting when she started yelling at Orlean and those around her. Bargaining is a little less obvious, but I think that her trying to go public and convince others to care was her form of bargaining. Depression was when she felt resigned and signed the Attorney General's deal then started working in a convenience store. She seemed entirely apathetic about her impending death until meeting Yule (Timothee Chalamet). The final step acceptance seemed to happen while she was with Yule.

The individual is important, for without the individual in multiplicity, there is no group. But the group is important too, and that's the major conflict inherent in Humanity at large: the needs of the many versus the needs of the few.

First, it's a comedy, so consider not thinking too hard about it. Second, I just rewatched the introduction on youtube - I'm not sure it promotes eugenics or at least it's a big stretch to get there.  It brings up the idea of evolution, so they are at least partially discussing heritability of intelligence, which is fiercely debated but probably somewhat heritable. Remember that who a person is depends on genetics \*and\* environment, and environment plays a big role here.  Eugenics has a very dark spot in human history that attempted to directly interfere in human genetics to optimize human genetic code.  I didn't see it promoting that or even making a statement on it.  

I do, however, see it possibly making a comment on the complex issue of home environment and education and family size.  There is a well understood relationship between level of schooling and family size and affluence and there are many sociological studies investigating this.  If there is a sociological intervention on this I would suggest the solution is better education and certainly not eugenics - forced sterilization of individuals deemed genetically unfavorable -  is a horrible, dark time in human history.

If you can let fix the problem then all you can do is try to bring as much real pleasure, in the form of time with loved ones, into the world. 

Maybe I'm too pessimistic, but I don't think climate change will get solved. Individuals and groups can make changes to limit their carbon footprint, but without many world governments working together to make big sweeping changes the problem will continue to get worse. 

So, I still do everything I can to help on an individual level. I educate my students about climate change and try to minimize my own carbon footprint. But I realize this is really all in vain. So, I agree with Leo.  The best thing to do is to enjoy our time as much as possible in positive ways. ""we really did have it all"" is the quote from Leo at the end.

hq20j46,"The powerplants thing is non negotiable. It doesn’t matter if we kill all billionaires today, we’ll still need more power plants.

If energy usage is going down it means we’re seriously fucking something up. 

India and China are getting several hundred million people out of poverty, and those people will now consume electricity. Nowhere near Western excesses, but even one fan and a few LEDs per person adds up.

They will consume more, simply by existing, because now they will go to schools and use hospitals, all of which uses energy. But a promising sign is that their electric grids are increasingly renewable. It’s already 30-40% of capacity.

The continent of africa will repeat a similar process in the coming decades. So energy reducing is not a solution

The greatest use of steel and concrete has been for roads, railways, dams, and housing in places where none of these have existed before.

Billionaires can eat shit, but investor driven property market is a tiny sliver of concrete used. 

We need to keep doing everything we do, because people in the west won’t suddenly live without the comforts they’re now accustomed to.
You can’t tell third worlders they can’t have nice things because the world won’t like it.

So the solution is making everything more efficient.

I’ll give some hard numbers. 60 percent of world emissions are energy related. Renewables can ease that. 29% of the remaining 40% is industrial processes.

We make 35Billion tons of CO2 per year. We can stop catastrophe by limiting that to 8Billion tons. 0 would be ideal, but impossible to reach without some crazy new invention.

The ‘contact process’ is used to make Sulphuric Acid. And sulphuric acid is used to make everything. If we double the efficiency of that one process, we can cut down on a few hundred million tons of CO2. That’s a significant amount of our target.

hqdgrz4,"> What does this movie have to say? 

1. Billionaires have enormous influence in our government. The steve jobs character was able to shout for the president by first name from the other room and she hustled out for him

2. Society is more interested in pop culture than the world ending: the pop artist breakup featured hugely over the segment with the main characters talking about an asteroid coming to earth

3. Politicians' main concern is politicking: the president squashed the asteroid story because midterms were coming up, and only brought the characters back when she was in hot water for sending nudes to the supreme court nominee

4. Those in power are often sociopathically focused on power dynamics: the general charging the main characters for snacks

5. Capitalism and profit motive are destructive forces working against humankind's interests: the diversion mission was cancelled because it was determined capturing the asteroid could result in large profits. Then, we get tidbits of this playing out in geopolitics: various countries selling out their coastal communities by negotiating for mineral rights in return for letting meteorites land off their costs, for example. 

6. The USA will use its military to generate and enforce profit for its capitalist class: I believe the PRC / India / Russia mission failed due to USA sabotage. I wish they had explored this more

7. Our idea that those in power will ""do the right thing"" when it comes to global disasters is a farce. So many other movies show countries working together and throwing their entire productive effort towards diverting an asteroid or whatever. This is obviously untrue and now we have a movie that's willing to point this out: during covid, not only did we depend on private organizations to develop a vaccine for us, we let them charge us for it, and this all happened in country-centric private bubbles (other than in the EU). *Then* our people didn't even trust the achievement because... reasons? So much for pandemic movies where a vaccine is made just before all of humanity dies and everyone takes it without question. 

8. Not only is our society not doing enough for global disasters like climate change in general, there's now a swath of the population that's formed an identity around irrationalism and anti-intellectualism. The title: ""don't look up."" The catchphrase forms a political movement that the president runs on, trucker hats and everything. Leonardo's character says in an interview, ""What do we do when we can't even talk to eachother anymore? How can we fix this?"" 

9. We're failing to protect and appreciate the incredible bounty we have today. Leo's last line: ""we really had everything, didn't we?""",rcyqse

Humanity will likely carry on unless it escalates to something like nuclear war. There will be mass suffering and devastation, but tons of life will survive, and will adapt to the new environment likely in a matter of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years.

With a meteor impact of that size, it's going to be much much worse. Humanity will have a much much larger chance of extinction. Life on earth in general will be much more heavily impacted and will likely take millions to tens of millions of years or longer to adapt. It'll be totally cataclysmic. Because of how immediate it will be there's not even any chance for selection pressures to develop.

Again I'm not saying that climate change isn't bad, it's ridiculously bad. It's the worst problem facing us, it's a complete catastrophe, it's something we needed to act on 40 years ago. We need immediate and dramatic action right now. But at the end of the day, it's ""only"" up to several degrees increase in temperature, up to metres increase in sea levels, etc. The planet has dealt with these sorts of changes in the past, and the impact has been serious but not complete destruction. But a meteor of that size hitting the planet is just complete and utter destruction and chaos, when we have seen it happen in the past it has caused an absolutely devastating impact.

>Capitalism causes its own set of problems but the system that incentivizes everyone to do what's best for themselves benefits others on the way up. 

That is blatantly and transparently false. I really don't know how anyone can say that with a straight face anymore. No, everyone being a hyper-greedy sociopath does not somehow result in better result for all than active collaboration. Besides which, massive power imbalances mean only a very few ever even get to act in their own self-interest and most act in the interest of others via threat of starvation and homelessness.  


Again, you've got it backwards in regards to food production. It's a profit driven market system that causes people to care less about producing food the moment the market says it's not longer profitable to do so, and actively incentivizes DESTROYING food to maintain local prices. You can still implement incentives for people to become farmers if you don't have enough, and just tie production to actual demand (in the form of hungry people) instead of artificial demand (in the form of market price). And it's not like farming is all small family plots anymore. A great deal of it is large, highly automated agribusinesses. Seize and nationalize those assets and scale production accordingly and stop wasting what's already produced.

Most of the socialism/planned economy =  famine talking points are nothing more than completely fabricated propaganda. The few instances where it relates to anything in reality it usually ends up being a case of management by people with no knowledge of farming and putting pet ideology and politics over agricultural science. Pretty easily solved by listening to the actual experts on relevant subjects. The same way you'd consult actual engineers instead of a politician if you wanted to build a bridge. And once again, Capitalism really doesn't want to get into an argument of who starved more people.

While there are a couple prominent examples of the revolution being hijacked by bad actors and veering completely off course of the initial goals (a risk in any revolution and a good reason to be wary of vanguardism and to try to get the new democracy up and running as soon as possible), most of that ""failed every time"" phenomenon is due to a very specific reason. Imperialist powers (usually the US) come in and blows the shit out of them. The moment a country democratically votes to start using their resources for the benefit of their own people or even sees a socialist political party start gaining significant traction, it's either an open attempt at regime change, or the CIA swoops in and starts assassinating people and funding far right death squads. People wonder why the Middle East and large parts of Central and South America are such a shit show. It's because we drenched them in blood trying to kill any socialist movement in its infancy, and killed all the folks in favor of secular democracy along with it. Honestly, Cuba has done shockingly well with having a hostile super power so nearby and all the sanctions and destabilization attempts by the CIA . Massive gains in healthcare, education, food security, and general quality of life since the US backed Batista dictatorship was overthrown. Far from perfect, but pretty damn well given the circumstances.

So yeah, in order to end Capitalism and transition to a sustainable resource driven economy that still lifts the quality of life for 99.99% of the planet would require toppling US imperialism so as not to be instantly crushed. Do I think that's likely to happen in the near future? Not really. It just so happens to be a necessary step in taking serious action to avert the worst of climate catastrophe, because we sure as hell wont' be taking necessary action as long as it's still around. And unfortunately I don't see any way to achieve that without a bloody revolution that will cause massive collateral damage and produce a shit ton of greenhouse gasses in the process, because the ruling elite have made it very clear that they will burn the planet to ash before they give up even a miniscule amount of wealth and power to the working class.",rcyqse

I've been in church services where the pastor likens Catholicism to idol worship, which is just ridiculous. The main difference is that evangelicals believe in salvation by faith alone, not requiring works. Catholics believe you must perform certain sacraments to achieve salvation.

For one thing, money isn’t a real thing like “engineering expertise” and “enriched uranium” are. There’s a reason we didn’t throw trillions of dollars to make a COVID vaccine in a month, but instead threw billions of dollars to make it happen in six.

As an example, we’ve gotten better at welding as the decades roll by, but if you were to offer 5 trillion dollars to every welder on the planet to make an instantaneous weld at an arbitrary point in space tomorrow, none of them could do it, so, for building a rocket you’re already limited by how long it takes to weld, *not* by how many welders you hire.

houm86u,"I earned a Bachelor's degree in engineering from Arizona State University.  I grew up here in AZ as my user name implies.  I actually just kind of lucked into my first job working for a local Aerospace and Defense Contractor.  That job was more on the ""space"" side of things.  After a few years of doing that, I moved over to a new position was a company that manufactures rockets.  

There are tons of systems on rockets.  I work on rockets parts that align with my engineering degree.  Forgive me for being vague, but I really don't like to broadcast a lot of this information.

If you really want to work in the rocket launch industry, you'll need at least a Bachelor's in an engineering field.  A Master's degree would certainly help.  I used to be a hiring manager with my current employer.  We really liked to see new hires that had spent their spare time in college clubs that were oriented towards Aerospace Engineering projects.  Having extra curricular experience that aligned with rockets was a big plus.

Now, as far as the fanciful satirical world of ""Don't Look Up"" is concerned...  I mean...  It's not reality.  Right?  

The scene where Ron Pearlman was getting launched into space on a shuttle with a big armada of Nuclear weapons was visually pretty cool, but realistically, it was stupid.  I was cringing really hard at that point.  It was just too hard for me to suspend disbelief.  If you're familiar with the concept of delta-V, you'll understand this.  Basically, the Space Shuttle only has enough rocket fuel to make it into Orbit a couple hundred miles up.  it would not have been able to get anywhere near the comet.

As far as the Russian/Chinese rocket blowing up is concerned.  I mean, that kind of stuff happens even when you have years to plan a rocket launch.  Here is some video of a SpaceX rocket blowing up on the launch pad.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6FNIdbPGV4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6FNIdbPGV4)

hqn2tje,"Oh hey, sorry for the late reply. There isn't any specific theory that I could point to you, but rather the totality of the problem. In short, everything that you can think of as being a potential issue becomes magnified with interstellar settlement. Here are some examples (non-exhaustive):

1) The unknown long-term effects, but known deleterious effects that impact travel such as muscle loss from lack of gravity (no, a propulsion system that attempts 1g of constant acceleration won't actually work) and higher incidence of cancer

2) humans have struggled to cooperate for very long periods in small, confined groups. The failure of the biodome experiments point to this, and attempting large scale colonization magnifies these issues tremendously

3) We don't actually know if it's possible to construct a vessel that can survive interstellar journeys. Theoretical travel within the solar system is almost certainly within our technological grasp, but requires methods quite different from today IMO (orbital shipyards to get around the mass-launch problem; completely ignoring the effects of economy or currency in being able to secure the necessary materials such as lead or gold for radioactive shielding, etc.). Also, even though it's technologically/mechanically possible, that's separate from the human side

4) All life on Earth evolved to live on Earth. It's impossible to duplicate every single factor somewhere else. We don't even know all the factors, but we know of many, such as atmospheric composition, the effects of the moon and it's orbit (far more impactful than many realize), the length of the day-night cycle, atmospheric pressure, etc. Now, the good news is that we know humans can actually adapt considerably to varying conditions, but we don't actually know how well *generations* would live and die under very different circumstances (we haven't actually even found a planet close to ours yet, so we don't know how close in proximity one might be either). There's actually a lot of interesting philosophical questions concerning transhumanism and how humanity is defined that relate to this, assuming survival is possible on a colonization candidate. This is on top of all the unknowns related to any potential terraforming. Even terraforming Mars is ""short-term"" in astronomical terms due to it's lack of internal heat and magnetosphere

5) all of the problems related to no. 4 above, but applied to every living thing you want to bring with us (even vegans eat things that used to be alive)

6) the logistics in transporting literally everything. Machines, tools, food, water, medicines, and so, so much more. Due to the distances involved, and the corresponding timescales in subluminal travel and communication, each expedition is effectively no different than journeys in antiquity except for the additional challenges of flying through space and colonizing another world

I have actually put more thought and detail into this, but I just got off work and it's not really coming to me, so my apologies. This is just kind of a very high-level primer that suggests the challenges involved may very well be too difficult to overcome for anything that we would like to accomplish (even automated He-3 mining from the gas giants and their moons may not be feasible)

Nowadays with 3d printing and technology improvements, I wouldn’t be surprised if you walk out with the new crown the same day.

We all kind of have to put a lot of faith in people and institutions we don't really know, ideas and abstractions that we don't intimately understand, in order for our society to get as far as it has. That's just reality, and it's kind of the best we can do. The shoulders of giants, right? Sure, some of us are confused or ignorant, and misplace that faith. Some of us are nihilistic or malicious or vindictive and work to actively mislead others, yes. And some people genuinely do put more into, or have a greater capability to understand the world around us.

Personally, I felt that scene was pandering to the religious crowd, and it (for me) was representative of a come-to-jesus moment right at the end of their lives, whereas the ritual of having a dinner with your loved ones and sharing stories was enough to show the love they had for each other. I personally would have found that scene more powerful and on-message for the movie if they had cut that scene and just had them die while having dinner, trying to bask in each others presence and appreciating the little things. I felt the prayer implied that they were holding out hope for an afterlife or whatever else, and I think it would have been better had their final moments been dedicated only to each other, without asking a higher power they have no reason to believe in to bless them. I would have appreciated the characters understanding that the kindness and appreciation they had for one another was just part of being human. Not at all trying to be edgy, I personally felt it would have been a better display of personal responsibility and been more on-message for the movie. Obviously you're free to disagree, and I'm glad you can.",rcyqse
hor4q5k,"How patronizing of you. Kindness absolutely does not come from spirituality. Perhaps for you, you use spirituality to justify your kindness, and that's fine. Kindness is a behavior, it's words and actions, and it's how people perceive you. What's kind to some people is unkind to others, but empathy is generally a common theme. Religion contradicts scientific fact, and for me, that's enough. Everyone can be kind, it certainly doesn't require any religion.",rcyqse
hpu1p2w,"When we're specifically debating spirituality and religion, I feel obligated to be honest about what I feel is a defense of reasonable fact, and the scienctific method. In this context I am truthfully not very hopeful in changing most minds, as I don't think people generally want to have their minds changed. I hope that by pointing out the glaring flaws in their logic, some people on the fence from a evidence-based PoV might be swayed. 

In all other contexts, I avoid discussion about spirituality and religion because for most people it's a deeply personal topic that doesn't have a place in most casual conversation. I don't attempt to prove to people that atheists can be kind and good, I just live that way and choose to be kind to everyone I meet. Most people have no way of knowing if my (or anybody else's) kindness is coming from a spiritual perspective or an atheistic one. Atheists don't actively attribute their kindness due to anything other than empathy, so it's hard to advertise the source of your kindness and give credit to your reasoning.

That being said, in the context of a movie review that was specifically about religion and spirituality, I feel entitled to be honest of my opinions, and the bluntness of my word choice is critical to accurately portray how I feel about these topics. I feel there is plenty of evidence to outright dismiss religion and spirituality as a whole, and being forced to cowtow around the topic in the name of not offending believers feels like an attempt by them to stifle real discussion and shame non-believers into silence. I don't I've been unkind in this thread, I've offered my opinion on religion as it was portrayed in the movie, people are free to disagree and I'm glad they are.",rcyqse

So it's less a ""pinning all the world's problems"" type of thing and more just an example of why having a shitty president can lead to a compounded issue. Even beyond that though, with someone as awful as Trump, we absolutely CAN and SHOULD blame him for shit that he fucked up. We're capable of doing both things - both complaining about what he left behind AND working towards a better future.

I was born in the 80's, so there wasn't yet the new atheist movement. I was reading about it aroung that age I was exploring spirituality, when I was 19 or 20. I thought it was interesting, but I disagreed about it from the beginning, because I already felt I left my anti-religious feelings behind - with the exception of Christianity. But growing up, as a teenager, I identified very strongly as an atheist, really liked provoking people into debates, specially more religious people. I made a point of telling people I did not believe in God and so on. I grew more tolerant with time, and also more patient - I understood there was no point in talking about the lack of a God with believers, who are 99% of Brazilians, counting non-religious people, according to the census. Patience was important, because anti-atheist comments popping up from nowhere were offensive to me, and still are, in a way - I feel almost like an ""ethnical atheist"". I empathize with atheists under prejudice and I even feel very at home around philosophy and fiction that come from an atheistic point of view. Though, as a convert, I see everything from a different point of view now. So, atheism and materialism were very important to my personal philosophy. It was as a young man that I became very suspicious of the possibility of we having true selves, and it is still an important intuition to me, which I try as possible to match with my belief in a trascendent soul.

However, I think the years around my conversion were kind of my ""formative years"" and I wasn't a full blown atheist by then. I think we have a stronger identity with a certain past self of ours then with the rest of them.",rcyqse

No, Adam McKay doesn't think climate change is an extinction level event - it's hyperbole, probably the most common narrative device used in satires)

Leo's speech in the talk show is another example of the film being a call to action, not simply a ""we're all gonna die lol"" nihilistic doomerism that you're accusing it of being.

Does your country have hundreds of millions of people in their total population, spread over almost an entire continent? It's quite a bit easier to govern and manage a small European country that doesn't have to deal with such a huge and wide diversity of people and different states with different mindsets, histories, priorities, issues, etc, so making a comparison of the US to say, Sweden, or Germany doesn't really make sense.

In general, I agree with this sentiment. 

> Because I view the message from the movie to be extremely shallow and transparent, even if I agree with it, therefor it's only purpose to me, me being a part of anyone, is what I qualify as 'fun' (which I then provide a descriptor of).

I would suggest a re-watch, or at least a reconsideration, because I actually do think you've missed the ""point"" of the movie. It was an expression of exasperation—there is *no* way to communicate warnings of existential crisis, no approach to messaging, no clever persuasion, no reasoned argument, that can reach and persuade enough people—in positions of power and not—to respond appropriately to existential threats to the species. The point isn't ""we need to respond to climate change"" or ""we need to respond to covid,"" it's ""our society is fundamentally ill-equipped to hear and respond to *any* warnings of dire consequences, and this movie, like any other possible movie that could be made, isn't going to change that.""

The reason for that, the movie argues, is that people in positions of power and influence do not believe they have any duty or obligation to say true-but-difficult-to-hear things to the public, and many parts of the public simply do not like listening to true-but-difficult-to-hear things and will engage in motivated reasoning to discredit or ignore the message itself. 

Changing the ending of the movie to be more ""fun"" would fundamentally change the message of the movie and make the whole thing pointless. It would have ruined the movie. 

I do think perceptions of this movie's flaws in pacing, acting, and dialog, and whether those flaws critically undermine the work, are strongly influenced by whether the viewer accepts the message—which is quite unpleasant!—or instead wishes they had watched a ""fun"" movie. Intentional or not, the critical response to the movie has neatly aligned with the movie's own critique of societal and human response to unpleasant-but-important messages.

They want to quickly establish how far from the status quo and how deserted the world has become as people prepare for the impact.

BUT the deer further emphasize how long the road way has been deserted - long enough for them to feel comfortable lounging about in the middle of the highway. Probably longer than an hour. People have become scarce in the face of the impact.

In mathematics, that term is called Big O. Where if you have a function x+y\^2, it doesn't matter what x's actual value is since it's a static linear number - it's utterly overshadowed compared to y\^2 which is an exponential, so x can be outright ignored in the calculations.

hpx0c1h,"Not the same guy as before, but I study a similar field and know lots about rockets. Not much of a ""generic"" list (because there's so much that can go wrong most failures are unique), but here's a few of the more interesting ones from the past couple decades to give you an idea of the types of things that can go wrong: 

[One rocket failed](https://youtu.be/PK_yguLapgA) because they used software from a prior iteration of the rocket without validating, and it went out of control from was essentially was a software glitch from a value overflowing. 

[One failed](https://youtu.be/OAX7UFd70M8) because an internal strut from a supplier wasn't able to handle as much stress as they claimed, which made a helium tank used to pressurize the main tanks come lose, rupture the upper stage, and the whole rocket disintegrated. 

[Another failed](https://youtu.be/vqW0LEcTAYg) because the sensor used to determine the rocket's acceleration was installed upside down, so it essentially thought it was going backwards and veered into the ground. 


Also generally speaking, something going wrong doesn't necessarily mean the entire launch or rocket will fail. There's been launches (Space Shuttle and Falcon 9 are the ones that come to mind) that had individual engines fail but still managed to get to orbit successfully.",rcyqse
hqdmij4,"u/ARocketToMars gave a great answer.  I'll give you my best attempt at adding on a bit to what he said. 

Generally speaking, there are three main reasons that I think launching rockets is VERY difficult.

1) The launch environment.  

You have to understand that launching a rocket unleashes SOOOO much chemical energy.  The rocket is designed to unleash all of that chemical energy in just a few minutes.  A byproduct of the quick release of all of that energy is a very intense vibration environment.  Think of the difference between driving down a smooth asphalt road vs driving on a bump dirt road.  It's like that, except literally 1 million times worse.  And it's not just the vibration environment, you also have to deal with the acoustic environment.  The sound is literally so loud it can break mechanical and electrical parts.  But wait, there's more.  

On top of that nasty dynamic environment that occurs because of the rocket burn, you literally use explosives to chop your rocket in half two, three, or even four times per rocket launch.   Rocket staging events generate enormous shock waves that propagate throughout the launch vehicle.  If you have any sensitive parts, you do your best to keep them far away from the explosives, but this isn't always possible.  

All of that being said, all of this stuff is probably the best understood problem we deal with.  It takes an enormous amount of engineering resources to plan for these problems, but we can do it.  Dealing with this set of problems mostly takes A TON of time and manpower.

2) Economies of scale and supply chain management.  

Think of an iPhone.  How many of those things does Apple make.  I just looked it up on Wikipedia.  Over the history of the iPhone, THEY HAVE MADE 2.2 BILLIONS iPhones!!!!  Now look at the Falcon 9.  It is arguabbly one of the most successful rockets ever made.  How many of those have flown successfully? 132.  Now, look at the Apollo program and the Saturn V rockets.  12 Successful launches.  

Maybe a better comparison is commercial aviation.  Boeing has made nearly 7,300 737's and has back orders for almost 2,800 more.  Airbus has made 10,000+ of the A320 family.  Combined, I'd guess all of these commercial aircraft have HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF FLIGHT HOURS.  Now, let's circle back to the Flacon 9, the most successful rocket in human history (arguably).  If each of those 132 successful flights has a total of 20 minutes of active rocket flight, that's 44 combined hours of active Flacon 9 flight.  (note, I'm saying ""active"", as in the time when the rocket is being propelled by its own power, not coasting in orbit)  Hundreds of millions of commercial airplane flight hours vs less than 100 rocket flight hours.  We just don't do it enough.  It's hard to be really good at something that you don't do as much of.  

3) The consequences for small mistakes are incredibly large.  

There are literally hundreds of small little things that can wrong that can cause a rocket to crash.  One of our rocket chief engineers is a friend of mine.  I talked to him about what the day before a launch is like for him.  The entire day before the launch he would just replay every single little thing in his head that could go wrong and cause the rocket to crash.

Here are a few examples.

That tiny piece of contaminants that got into your hydraulic actuator?  Ya, that caused your second stage rocket motor to go off course for five seconds, which resulted in going slightly off course and now you don't have enough delta-V to make it into orbit, so you crash in the Indian Ocean.

Oh?  You didn't think it would get below freezing overnight and you didn't design your O-rings that contain hot rocket gases for freezing temps?  Now you' blow up a space shuttle and kill a teacher and other astronauts.

What?  you didn't notice that piece of frozen condensation that hit your heat shield during launch?  Now your going to burn up on re-entry and kill more NASA astronauts.

Huh?  You decided to use 50+ year old soviet rocket engines in your new brand new launch vehicle and then your surprised when the turbo pumps can't handle the load?  You crashed an ISS resupply rocket.

Your engineers forgot how to convert between metric and imperial units, so you crashed a rover trying to land on Mars.

Darn, your breathing ventilation valve failed when you separated from the mother-ship and three Cosmonauts suffocated.

Your engineers put the wrong values in the specification for the inertial reference systems and you missed your orbital inclination by 20 degrees.  The satellites still made it to orbit, but they have to burn up a bunch of their fuel to get into the right orbit and it shortens their useful life.

You've got to be kidding me... You failed to properly consider the loads on the separation charge on your nose cone, resulting in your nose cone failing to properly deploy.  The extra mass you were carrying kept your rocket from making it to orbit.  And then three years later, you did the exact. same. thing. again.

What?  Who would have know that when oxygen gets too cold it would not react well with the carbon fiber tanks and blow up your rocket on the launch pad.

Darn.  A propellant leak caused one of the fuel lines to sever.  Luckily you rocket still flew on four of the five engines.  Unfortunately with all five engines, your thrust to weight ratio was 1.25, so with four, it's only 1.00.  You spend quite a few uncomfortably long seconds essentially hovering before you start to move away from the blue marble.  But that darn gravity well is just too strong with only four engines.  You burn through all of your fuel and the range safety officer pushes the big red button when he knows the resulting debris field won't hurt anybody.",rcyqse

Humans individually are very much products of their environment, but religion as a whole fosters ignorance and placates a natural curiosity for how the universe works with human-centric lies, and is often used as justification for projecting unfounded beliefs onto other people. Individually, people can be great or terrible, regardless of their beliefs, and actions speak louder than words. Be a good person because you want to be a good person because you know that having people be good to you is nice, not because you think some third party is assessing your moral quality. Being religious or spiritual certainly doesn't preclude one from being kind or good, the vast majority of the time religion or spirituality won't even be being thought about. Most people are good most of the time, and most people are spiritual or religious, so just going off these numbers, most generally-good people are religious or spiritual(and vice-versa).

I don’t know that I would agree with that at all. Inter-country politics didn’t have any narrative thrust in the story. It was an allegory about climate change. The whole point of the aborted mission was to show how we could have had a chance. The interruption of money thwarted that chance when the usual people who deny things like this (conservatives/corporations) listened to the scientists and the data for once, and put aside all politics and worked together. 

From a narrative standpoint, mixing in global politics gets in the way of theme at that time. The mission was the best case scenario of everyone (in an ideological sense) would set aside politics and work towards solving the problem.

The pandemic for the most part has been fought by government and the majority of people to reduce its damage on society and our populations. Climate change on the other hand like in the movie has been completely swept under the rug. Government have taken way to long to take action ( if they have at all ) and we’ve basically left it up to corporations and   entrepreneurs to solve the problem. The media until recently didn’t take it seriously ( and honestly still hasn’t, considering it’s the biggest threat to our society you’d think they would be talking about it 24/7) instead they will talk about some new study for like 10 seconds and then talk about some other bullshit that doesn’t matter that completely distracts us from real problems, and the general public eats it up and gets outraged by things that really don’t matter and have such a short attention span get outraged by some other thing that doesn’t matter a day later. 

Considering how much middle America and rural voters love the outdoors and being in the wilderness you’d think that they would see all the effects of climate change is having on our forests, lakes, streams, animal life, bugs and all that stuff that’s in the areas they like to hunt and fish in, but the choose to not see it, That is the Dont Look Up moment we are all living through.",rcyqse

hr9g76u,"I appreciate your thorough responses. Thank you.

**This was a LOT longer than I thought, and was basically just responding to your points. Feel free to skip to the last bolded paragraph.**

It's absolutely worth mentioning that I am potentially an outlier to the efficacy of this movie's method of sending the message - I'll try to explain:

My career has put me into a position where I have a passion for understanding many different perspectives so that I can better provide a product that users can engage with to fulfill their needs. This is important because humans in general are awful at voicing their desires.

Now why do I mention this? If you look up my total comments on analytic sites, you'll see about 400 comments in the /r/asktrumpsupporters subreddit from me. Not for persuasion purposes, but to better understand the people that *defy* logic, rational thought, Socratic method and generally commit to mental gymnastics to appeal to a crowd so that they can 'win'. 

**I am now jaded.** Between the tools that I use in my day to day career at one of the largest software companies in the world to better understand human sentiment, to directly interacting with humans and engaging their thought process, I am jaded. 

Let's bring it back now. The expression of exasperation that you're maybe 'finding' in this films message, is so blatantly obvious in **not just one particular political ideology, but humans in general, as we do not value critical thought in our scholastic curriculum**. If you're engaged in politics, or engaged in any type of metric aggregation (like big data AI work) where you look at huge datasets of vast demographics, these 'messages on the wall', the ""Society cannot be **reasoned** with, because they are **unreasonable** (as the true definition of the word)"" message might as well be on a giant, glowing blinking marquee not in times-square, but lit on the Moon for all to see. 

>I do think perceptions of this movie's flaws in pacing, acting, and dialog, and whether those flaws critically undermine the work, are strongly influenced by whether the viewer accepts the message—which is quite unpleasant!

I agree - I don't think I've seen many people use the flaws that I mentioned as justification to **disregard** the message or use it as a sleight against the message. I certainly didn't. The plot, and message of the movie is great, I still personally believe it's still shallow in that it's surface-level and basically just appeals to the cathartic side of me that wants to roll my eyes in agreement of how doomed we are as we continue to spiral into anti-intellectualism. **I still think this is  okay, and doesn't / shouldn't detract from the film - only that the execution of the film, that I subjectively have qualms with should.**

Lastly:

>Changing the ending of the movie to be more ""fun"" 

Just to be clear, when I mention the movie being fun, I don't mean the ending or whatever, the movie doesn't have to be Jungle Cruise to be 'fun' - Just entertaining without long swaths of non-fun (read as stale dialog, or not entertaining portions - **this is subjective**)

Again, as I appreciate your responses, and I think beyond this we'd probably speak passed eachother, as I believe we've clarified our thoughts, I want to leave with some resolution.

I agree with you that the message is just, I do think that I am perhaps a bit too hand-wavy? (unsure of the proper word here) that the message is too shallow and doesn't resonate with anyone *truly*, simply because this is something that has been hammered into our every-day lives for the last 7 years, and if this is just **now** news or a message to 'take away', then where have you been; However, that is selfish and pretentious of me to assume everyone is as 'clued in' to what the message would be to see this as redundant appeasement to the greater public.

My last takeaway for you to hopefully see my greater point (again, talking specifically about the criticism of the film's execution, and not the message or plot):

**Do you believe the film used the 2.5 hours effectively? Do you believe the extra 30-45 minutes added to the messages poignancy?** 

If your answer is no, then we see more eye to eye than it may appear in our messages. If your answer is yes, because society (movie goers) needed to see the president's disregard 8 times instead of 7, then my eyes glaze over even more harshly at how far a message needs to be driven for someone to have an 'a-ha' moment in 2022.",rcyqse

More likely they think, if he’s not worried enough about it to stop flying private jets, why should I be concerned enough to start car pooling? 

Your food shelter example is not a good comparison. We can buy food for shelters, but we cannot just throw money at climate change. To actually combat climate change people and corporations across the globe have to significantly change their behavior. 

I think people like Leo actually set back progress when it comes to climate change. When the leaders of a movement say you need to change your behavior to reduce your carbon footprint, but you see them having an excessive carbon footprint with absurd luxuries, why would you take the burden and inconvenience when they won’t? 

If the people speaking out about climate change want to change people’s behavior, they need to not have the philosophy of do as I say not do as I do. Instead they need to lead by example. Climate Change meetings where people fly their private jets from across the world, in some cases where the hosting city has to stop letting them land because there is no more room to land is a satirical solution to climate change. Especially when we have the technology to have a lot of this conversation done remotely.
