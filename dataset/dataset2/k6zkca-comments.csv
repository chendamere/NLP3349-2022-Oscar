geo8jq1,The sound mixing/editing deserves SO much attention this upcoming Oscar season holy shit.,k6zkca
gerfe5d,The shot of Ruben drumming on the metal slide while the little boy put his ear to it was fucking beautiful. I’m tearing up thinking about it.,k6zkca
geot0tm,THAT LAST SCENE.,k6zkca
geqvqwo,"That ending was so well done.  They didn’t harp on the break-up or basically that his life is now in shambles and he is homeless, yet it had such an impact in those final moments.  He got the implants to get back to his old life, thus destroying his new life, only to find his old life has moved on without him, and is left with essentially little to nothing.",k6zkca
gey7kmd,"One thing I love about this movie is the lack of extreme plot twist. I’ve become so accustomed to thinking, “alright what shit is gonna happen next...” and it turns out? Nothing. And I really loved that. The center wasn’t fishy or suspicious, Lou never do anything out of line, and Ruben although stressed never had a crazy tantrum destroying anything outside of the trailer scene. 

The Sound of Metal is a great title as well.",k6zkca
gewvmvf,I just realized the title refers to both the music Ruben played and the sound his new implants gave him.,k6zkca

geohxnr,"Beautiful film. I don’t have so much an analysis but just wanted to share personally how much this movie struck a chord with me.

I played in a touring band and am into the same bands as Ruben (if his shirts are any indication) so that’s what initially compelled me to give it a watch, but was not at all expecting how much I would identify with his story.

I am an addict who was in a long term relationship with a non-addict. I had an intervention via a relative and was essentially forced into rehab despite my wishes. My partner promised she would wait. That scene of Lou and Ruben standing at the cab broke me- because essentially same conversation happened to me.

After arriving at the rehab, fighting it, a couple of months go by and I eventually began to find my place & form deep bonds with the people in my facility. I was offered a job there to work with others dealing with their addiction. 

However, my primary goal was to get back into my relationship, get back to my band. “Save my life”

So against the advice of everyone in my program, I left. 

I returned and tried to revive my relationship, since I was now “fixed” . But we were on two totally separate life trajectories at that point. That open arm embrace upon my return that I had been fantasizing about was instead stifled, awkward. We just didn’t jive anymore. Our breakup looked the same too, through tears and solemn acceptance.

My sobriety ultimately failed- and I can’t help but wonder if it’s in part because I prioritized the wrong things at the time.

So yeah, wonderful movie. Makes me really love and appreciate the power of film. Feels weird getting so personal on this sub, but if you read this, thanks.",k6zkca
genzv6e,"The scene where Joe is telling Ruben he can’t stay with the group anymore; specifically when Ruben is anxiously explaining why he needs money, and Joe tells him he is acting like an addict was incredibly well done by both actors. The mix of disappointment/sadness but softness from Paul Raci, and the frustration and inner turmoil from Riz is done perfectly. A scene that will stick with me for a while.",k6zkca
geoh33y,Is that really what it sounds like for people with implants? I naively assumed it would be like audio feed of normal sound. Not the crackling static.,k6zkca

gjmeppj,"Anyone else notice how when Ruben starts working on the roof and Joe says not to, it’s because “it doesn’t need fixing” just like his deafness doesn’t need fixing? Thought it was a cool little detail",k6zkca
gh90i8y,"Just watched it. My cousin's wife, who recommended it,  has cochlear implants.  She can't really understand music thru the implants, either.

I don't think this movie is really about just deafness specifically.  It's about loss.  Ruben spends the whole movie trying to get his old life back. The airstream, the gig life, the metal, the girl.  And he can't, because none of it is the same after. He rejected the deaf commune because it required him to cut ties with the hearing world, and everyone in it. He wants his old life back, that's the goal.

In the end, he has that moment of acceptance. Of course he's not throwing away the implant forever, he's just cutting off the sounds when it gets overwhelming. He gets his moment of stillness, when he accepts that everything has changed and he can finally move forward. He has nothing, but he's finally free.",k6zkca

geodjid,"This is one of those movies that really scares me and it's heartbreaking. 

It really was a rollercoaster of emotions. 

I found it funny that Matthew Amalric is in this movie when he had another which evoked similar feelings, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. Movies were the main character goes through a medical ordeal in this way always unsettle me.

It definitely is Top 5 for me this year.",k6zkca

ggpmode,"I guess people choose to view this film differently. There are some that choose to interpret the moments more reassuringly as acceptance. I thought the ending was incredibly sad.

ggzfrfd,"Okay, I get that movies studios do remakes/reboots/sequels/IP movies to make money, but this film is a textbook example of what major movie studios should be filming.

gfe7xuz,"I've been a drummer my whole life and this movie, while great, was also big time nightmare fuel. Couldn't be happier that my drum teacher was always constantly pounding the need for hearing protection into my head; You can't catch me at a gig without in-ears with sound canceling / a show without sonic earplugs. Protect your hearing people, once its gone its gone!",k6zkca
genymk6,"I've been looking forward to watching this one for quite a bit and I'm glad to say it was unsurprisingly good. It's filled with impeccable sound design and a moving performance from Riz Ahmed (which is one of my favorites of this entire year). This was just really well made, and absolutely devastating. 



P.S I have never been more distracted by a pair of eyebrows through out a movie.",k6zkca
gf502fz,"I love how Ruben’s entire story arc can be summed up with three different interpretations of the title:

1. The sound of metal, the music genre 
2. The sound of the metal slide
3. The sound of the metal implants (metallic sound)

Such a beautiful, sad, and horrifying story. Loved it.",k6zkca
gewxpy6,"As far as I’m concerned, this is the best film of 2020 thus far. My senses are sloshed, and I mean that in the most overwhelmingly endearing way possible.

geoa523,Riz should get an Oscar nom.,k6zkca
gulo2w7,"So I’m a little late here, but as a implantee, I thought I would offer my 2 cents to the movie and I can only compare it to my journey.

First off, the first act of him losing his hearing... I lost mine slowly, so I can’t imagine how frustrating it would be to lose it so quickly.   The having to have you SO talk on the phone was very realistic.   

I’m deaf, not Deaf (there’s a difference), so I never am going to be part of the Deaf community, so the second act when he is at the rehab center and deaf school were not something I connected with.

The surgery/activation.   I understand it’s a movie and you have to condense some things.   Getting activated doesn’t just make everything better, you have to work on it.   There’s hearing therapy involved and you have to train your brain to deal with the new sounds.   The metallic hearing he heard and the scenes at the party and walking down the street were realistic.   Getting implants doesn’t make the world loud, it makes it busy.  However, your brain adapts... he could easily go back to playing drums and living his previous life.

Living in the Deaf community vs the rest of the world:  For Ruben, being accepted into the Deaf community offered him stability and a community vs the nomadic life he was living.   It ends with realizing Lou was better off without him, leaving him all alone.  But for most of us, the choice would be to obviously live in the rest of the world.   Would I leave my family, kids, friends and job just to join the Deaf community?  No, that would make no sense.   So for most of us, getting an implant let’s us function better in the world.  

The sound:  I found it pretty accurate, the muffling when he’s deaf and the busyness when he gets activated.   And I’ve been there when you take it off and the world goes silent, like the end of the film, and it’s a great relief.  But it’s even better when you turn it back on and talk to your loved ones.",k6zkca
geozjzn,"Paul Raci as Joe was a really great performance. Could really get a good feel of his emotions in every scene. Especially the final one between him and Riz Ahmed where he has to tell Ruben to leave the house.

The sound editing was very well done. It made things quite stressful and it hurt to be placed in Rubens world and feel his frustration. Really felt for him after the surgery didn’t end up working for him.",k6zkca
gjozwu6,Late response but I really enjoyed the movie. The ending scene in bed was very real. Trying to get back his old life but coming to the conclusion that it wasn’t going to work. Then telling her she saved his life. And that he’s thankful for her. One of the most real breakup scenes I’ve seen in media.,k6zkca
giug62d,"This movie was humbling. Simple, straightforward, gripping and real.

I loved the juxtaposition of the ending. His life is seemingly at its worst, and it’s only then when he discovers a moment of stillness.

The final shot left me humbled. It left me emotional and inspired. It reminded me that I value the pursuit of mindfulness, even though day-to-day routines and habits ultimately end up distracting me a majority of the time.

It left me annoyed with myself that I haven’t taken enough time out of my life to be still.

Truly one of the most human movies I’ve seen",k6zkca
gk785vp,"Fantastic sound design throughout the film. The last couple of scenes with Ruben & Lou in bed, then Ruben on the bench were fantastic. Was really anxious leading up to Ruben leaving to see what had happened to Lou and was very happy to see her also happy, if not very different; probably how Ruben felt too.

What does everyone think ends up happening with Ruben? Does he go back to the community, continue with making music, or embrace an entirely different path?

Think my personal takeaway from this film is to try to have some quiet time to myself. I cram media consumption in damn near every second of my waking life. I need to sit down with a hot coffee and a doughnut and just exist for a while sometimes.

EDIT: Think my favourite scene was the final conversation between Ruben & Joe. Joe breaking emotionally after being such a rock for so long really got to me. It was like seeing a close friend who you've never seen cry, cry. Really great performance.",k6zkca
gs2fjir,"Notice the disappointment at the quality of sound he finally experiences in the doc’s office. The whole time before that initial activation he’s thinking how the implants will be a return to normalcy, and the restrained response that revealed so much was just amazing from an acting perspective. I swear I could hear his thoughts. So well done",k6zkca
geytpu0,"Brilliant film about a topic I haven’t seen before. As someone with a disability, it meant a lot to me that the actors at the rehab were in the deaf community in real life too. 

I hope Riz Ahmed is recognized this award season. He’s a wonderfully natural actor.",k6zkca
gjbdeue,"The ending is so bittersweet and it feels so authentic in how it handled the subject matter of life. 

At the end of it all, he has to come to terms with the fact that as much as he tried, the life that he once had was over. His hearing would never be the same and him and Lou are at separate paths in life. As he takes in Joe’s earlier advice to sit and take things in, he comes to also realize that life goes on; his old life may gone but as he takes some time to reflect, he finds some calmness and peace as he begins his next chapter in life.",k6zkca
gsktf5p,"Did anyone realise when Ruben first got to the deaf community and sat there trying to figure out everyone’s hand gestures and signals? He was so confused, he doesn’t understand what’s going on and how to be deaf. Fast forward to when he’s in the party at Lou’s father’s place, he got his hearing back but he still didn’t understand, because of the language and the cochlear implants.

I just thought it’s devastating juxtaposition. He can’t wait to get his old life back yet it’s never the same, life passes.",k6zkca
genwddf,"Saw this Thursday night and have been waiting ever since to talk about this great movie and Riz Ahmed's perfect performance.

I've always been a big fan of movie scores. But the absence of one here was amazing, to just be immersed in muffled sounds/silence and nature, was profoundly effective. Starting with that chilling first time his hearing went out when they were setting up the merch booth, Riz's acting and the sound design were so successful at bringing us into Ruben's world. His panic, the desperation to return to who he used to be. But also hope and calm, like that beautiful scene with the student on the playground slide.

Also, a shout out to Paul Raci (Joe, the leader of the deaf house/program) who was great too. That final talk between him and Ruben made me cry. ",k6zkca
gfn7f7k,"I don’t know if you guys noticed but during the ending credits you can hear childrens laughter in the background.. implying that Ruben eventually went back to helping out at the school and starting a new future.

Truly a beautiful film.

Each of them found a new normal.",k6zkca
ghkw1sv,"Very good film, one of the year’s best so far. It absolutely deserves the positive reviews and awards buzz it’s been getting. Riz Ahmed was great and the story was very moving, I wished Hollywood could do more movies like this.",k6zkca
gep2x0d,"I was highly anticipating this movie because I am an audiologist. I had some issues with this movie, but overall really appreciated the light it sheds on my profession, the Deaf community, and the importance of the ability to communicate with others. All of the acting was amazing (obviously Riz Ahmed) including Lulu and Joe.

Sudden permanent hearing loss is rare, but terrifying. It usually occurs in just one ear, but in Ruben's case, can occur bilaterally. HOWEVER, an initial identification of sudden bilateral sensorineural hearing loss would NEVER stop with the audiologist, especially < 24 hours after occurrence. The audiologist would have referred to an otolaryngologist (audiologists are not MDs) where steroid injection in the ear has potential for hearing recovery, at least to some extent. In the movie, Ruben went from deafness to living at the Deaf community in what seemed like 3-4 days, when really 4-6 weeks of treatment would occur between those events. Also, Ruben's hearing loss was portrayed as possibly stemming from noise exposure. Yes, loud noise can damage hearing, but drumming with in-ear monitors would not cause a sudden hearing loss like Ruben had.

Next, the portrayal of cochlear implant had some good and bad aspects. The sound quality through a cochlear implant is drastically different from hearing through the typical acoustic pathways. I can't say if it was exactly what CIs sound like (it is actually different for every wearer due to differences in insertion depth/position), but it was mostly realistic, especially the incredible difficulty in background noise situations. HOWEVER, these expectations would always be explained to Ruben UPFRONT. He would not be going into the surgery with expectations of perfectly restored hearing unless there was a gross negligence of counseling on the audiologist and surgeon's part. What's also important to remember is that much of the initial distorted sound through CIs naturally resolves as the brain adapts to hearing sound in that manner over time.

In my opinion, these were two issues that were pretty crucial to the plot and somewhat removed me from the movie. I realize only someone with specific knowledge of that would be annoyed by it and without knowing that, the movie was truly fantastic. Acting, emotion, sound. I would recommend this movie to anyone to gain a better understanding of the Deaf world and a better appreciation for the abilities we take for granted.

Shameless ""plug"": Please wear hearing protection around loud noise.",k6zkca
gepxtpv,Fuck me. I hope Joe ends up letting him come back if he keeps the implant attachment off. This movie fucked me up,k6zkca
ggw888c,After watching this movie I am fully on the Riz Ahmed train. Kindof doubted the constant praise he gets. But now I get it.,k6zkca
gjnq9f9,"I was left breathless when I watched this movie back in November. It's so real. As a Deaf and Hard of Hearing person, I never thought I would see the angst and confusion inexperienced as a child on screen. I loved it so much I did a review. I encourage you to watch it to get a perspective from a deaf and hard of hearing person: https://youtu.be/FIW8oVGAdwU",k6zkca
gknrgl2,I'm curious to know whether those implants actually sound that bad in real life. Does anyone know?,k6zkca
gf4pun7,"Great acting throughout and gut punches in every act. I gasped when they >!turned on his implants and it sounded like someone speaking through a broken drive-through box. And I'm sure they would have explained that to him, but Rueben seemed so damn stubborn to get his hearing back!<",k6zkca
ghd7pq4,"Really beautifully observed - the most moving film I've seen this year (though to be fair, I haven't been moved by much thus far). 

The film never judges; Marder just stands back and lets you feel Ruben's journey. And that final scene was pitch-perfect. Riz Ahmed and Paul Raci were amazing in their roles - I never felt a trace of actorly technique. They did so much by showing emotional restraint.That said, the film didn't quite wreck/inspire me the way I thought it would. 

I think the biggest issue for me was the way it glossed over important developments (Ruben goes from signing the alphabet to becoming fluent within a few minutes of runtime) or avoided potentially gripping scenes (Ruben getting caught using Joe's computer). Also, Olivia Cooke was fantastic in her limited scenes and I could have used more of her character.

But overall, Marder is definitely one to watch and Ahmed and Raci absolutely deserve the awards buzz they're getting.",k6zkca
gqx0hey,"As someone who used to be a blues rock drummer in my teens and 20s, the scene where he first starts silently panicking from a tinnitus episode legitimately made me feel like I was on the edge of a panic attack because it reminded me of my tinnitus episode when I was younger.  This movie is incredible and I hate that it took me this long to see it.",k6zkca
gw0ukfr,"I lost all hearing over a year and a half when I was 16. Of course this move spoke to me. His experience was pretty accurate, I’d say. Expect his loss seemed to progress very rapidly, and they never explained the cause of the hearing loss. Not even my hearing loss was that rapid. If it was due to exposure to loud music, it wouldn’t be that rapid and it probably wouldn’t have continued to decline rapidly once he stopped playing in the band. 


A lot of the movie was true to the real world deaf community, a lot of them do view deafness as something that doesn’t need to be fixed and there are parts of the community who are very against cochlear implants, but most won’t shun people who do get cochlear implants. 


I’m not a candidate for cochlear because the auditory nerves between my cochlea and my brain are destroyed, so stimulating the cochlea wouldn’t work. Instead, I am a candidate for Auditory Brainstem Implants, which are similar to cochlear, only about twice as expensive, the surgery is much more dangerous, and the sound quality sucks much more than cochlear. Even if it’s nothing like the hearing I had before, I’d jumó on the opportunity to get an ABI immediately if presented with one. I don’t get the part of the community that’s so against fixing deafness. Yes, you can be proud to be deaf and embrace it, but I think we can all agree it’s a pain in the ass when interacting with the hearing world, and I’d just much rather have whatever tiny little sense of hearing an ABI would give me than stay completely shut out of the hearing world forever.",k6zkca
genydd2,"I was very taken back by this movie. I thought it would be good but I didn't expect it to go the direction it went. So much great storytelling in times when dialogue isn't necessary. Even before the hearing loss when we see how he takes careful care of his sound equipment and how much he loves Lou. 

I wasn't sure, at first, how him being an addict tied in to the movie. At first you think that the idea of him being sober the same amount of time he's been with Lou would mean that she saved him, which is true. But the main conflict within him seemed to be how ""addicted"" he was to their life before he lost his hearing. His singular focus is her and, in turn, the dynamic that kept them together being singer and drummer. As Joe predicted that focus got in the way of his acceptance of how his life would have to be now. Him sneaking e-mails to her and checking up on her tour seems harmless, but even when he's doing well at the retreat he still has the goal of getting his hearing back. And it's not because she might leave him, it's because he sees his ability to hear as necessary to keep the life they once had. 

It becomes clear towards the end that she never considered leaving and that him being her drummer wasn't what was keeping them together, but he was missing the forest for the trees. Only seeing what was directly in front of him. And that makes it all the more tragic when he gets the procedure and not only is he shunned from his co op, but he realizes he'll never truly have his hearing back or his ability to perform like he did.

There weren't many main or supporting performances, but the ones there were were just incredible. The scene where Joe had to kick Ruben out of the house for getting the operation and therefore implying there was something wrong with being deaf killed me. Props to Olivia Cooke too, who tends to play more fragile characters but is so strong and steadfast in this movie. 

Solid 8/10 with possibly one of the more beautiful endings this year. Riz absolutely carries this movie and he's looking effortless doing it.

/r/reviewsbyboner",k6zkca
gfp29bd,"Riz did an amazing job. You can see how desperate Ruben is throughout the film. And how he struggled to get his life back. And the most touching scene, the final scene, he finally accept the fact that he just can't go back to normal. It's heartbreaking.",k6zkca

gr3f3cy,Just wanna quickly praise Olivia Cooke here as I thought she was phenomenal and went toe-to-toe with Riz in all of their scenes. She’s come a long way since Bates Motel,k6zkca
gt09r8e,"I've never seen Riz Ahmed in anything before, probably because I don't watch that much British stuff. Man, he nailed it. 

I guess I didn't know what type of metal band to expect going in, but if I had to hazard a guess, it definitely wouldn't have been drone metal. Points for introducing that genre to the people who vote on Oscars, I'm sure the one Sunn O))) fan in the academy was digging it. 

I watched this without subtitles. I'm not sure how much I missed but surprisingly you can get a really good viewing experience without them. 

I also love how the movie doesn't clearly take Joe's side and end with Ruben going back and admitting he was wrong. I imagine it would ruffle a few feathers among people who actually got cochlear implants if they did. They show that the implants aren't a perfect substitute for functional ears, as a perfect substitute does not exist. This movie isn't trying to argue that deafness isn't a problem that needs to be fixed, it's content to introduce that debate and show the community responses to it. And I think that's cool. It's easy to get up on a soap box, but you can make a great film just by showing how people feel, no agenda necessary. 

Absolute worst scene: Ruben tries fixing the roof, Joe tells him ""You don't need to fix anything here."" My eyes rolled all the way back in my head when I heard that. In a movie that was otherwise fine script-wise, it's by far the hackiest thing they do.",k6zkca

gtzs896,"It is a sad movie, but also eye opening. How small things can alter our lives.. we spend everyday worrying about futilities, and only when we lose what we used to take for granted that we know how much it is worth.
If there is one word i could get out of this movie, it would be ""GRATITUDE""",k6zkca
gxru2qi,"ENDING TAKE: This is for the immediate ending, the very last scene. The sounds of a sheltered and controlled existence become very distinct when he is leaving Lou's place (birds, then motorcycle, stairs, door slamming). Then when walking in to the outside the sound distortion starts to kick-in and you start hearing more noises blending together in uncontrolled chaos. Now here is the absolute key parts of the ending. The church bells ring, the clanging of the bells represents his old life pre-hearing loss (sounds similar to cymbals on a drum kit). Then you also see the two kids playing with the skateboard which represents the life he lived at the rehab facility when he was interacting with the kids at the deaf school. He takes off his implants while listening to the church bells, which represents his realizing that he will never be able to live his past life. Then you see another shot of him looking at the kids with the skateboard and it's silent, that represents him realizing that if he wants to he can move on from his old life and still feel fulfilled in this world doing something else, like he was when he was helping the kids at the deaf school. 

Also the last scene is shot in such a way that yes, being able to hear sound has it's own beauty, but in a world so chaotic as ours (a busy cityscape is the perfect place to illustrate this point), being able to not hear and enjoy stillness can be a blessing sometimes and not perceived as a handicap (as alluded to multiple times previously). In a way, the non-deaf population has simulated this feeling with noise-cancelling headphones, ear-plugs, and other devices that try to block noise completely.",k6zkca
gex4tlq,"Gosh, this movie was simply amazing. I was enthralled from beginning to end, and Riz Ahmed was a revelation. I'll really be rooting for him to get some awards recognition & love, as well as for this movie as a whole. It has a quiet power to it that I think could propel it to being an awards darling -- though I know there are a lot of heavy-hitters coming during this atypical awards season.

Something I wanted to talk about was this movie's effortless case for why Representation matters. I talked about this with someone after watching, but have you ever seen a movie where there was a big dinner table scene that featured a bunch of people just talking in sign language? Those scenes in particular I found to be quite beautiful in their modesty. I loved the scenes with the deaf community -- both with the kids at the school and the adults at the house. So many moving & incredibly powerful moments. This cast also was quite racially diverse, too, I must say, with of course the lead of this movie being Pakistani.

Representation matters. Diverse opinions and diverse groups could lead to some diverse & incredible storytelling. Sound of Metal is a clear result of that. Bravo to Darius Marder and team.",k6zkca

gg7hfw2,"The Sound of Metal was written and directed by Darius Marder. It's the story of Ruben, a drummer on tour with a metal band. His life comes to a halt when he begins rapidly losing his hearing. As he grapples with his new reality and history of heroin addiction, he checks himself into a substance recovery group for a deaf community. Very few films can achieve the level of connection this movie makes you feel for its lead character. 

You dont just feel for Ruben, you participate in his crisis alongside him. The film doesnt try to explain anything to you, instead you experience everything as he does. It gives the audience a sensory connection to the events. It is not just the emotionally devastating performance by Riz Ahmed as Ruben. The film uses sound to tell the story as much as what you are seeing on the screen.

It moves easily between the chaotic noise of a life on the road as a metal musician, to a suffocating tension as the sounds are gradually replaced with ringing and muffled voices that sound as if they are coming through so much water. It will occasionally pull away from its lead character to contrast the muted world that he is not quite adjusting to. And in a few perfect sequences, the film captures moments of perfect stillness that left me feeling weightless. 

It is not an easy thing to watch or to hear. It is not a pleasant thing to feel the losses of ambitions and comfort, that come from adapting to a new normal. But I did not end the viewing feeling drained or sad. The ending felt complete and cathartic. I cant wait to see what else Darius Marder and Riz Ahmed have in store for the future.

My score:
9.4/10",k6zkca
gsanp0d,"Incredible movie. Watched it last night with a friend who is a sign language interpreter. I'm also a drummer.

The acting was so good and the sound editing to go between ""normal"" hearing and what Ruben was experiencing really gave you a feel of what he was going through. I also liked how they didn't have subtitles for the sign language when Ruben didn't understand sign but as time passed and he understood it more it gave the viewers subtitles to let you know Ruben knew what was being signed too.

Just an all around fantastic movie. I hope it wins some awards.",k6zkca
geosxcf,Had no idea that lady from the walking dead was actually deaf in real life.,k6zkca
ges45v7,"loved the ending shot where he finally sits in silence with the crowd. Just the way it was like his thoughts floating in and out of his head just completely visualized on screen. 

The way he was framed with the crowd behind him almost resembling the kids at the community and then an old man pass by as they pass by what looks like entering into his ear. then the woman pushing a stroller moving out of his ears as he accepts his new direction and that idea of future with lou drifts away. 

just really well done and stuck with me.",k6zkca
ggozd7f,"I have never seen a movie tackle deafness in this way. That early dinner scene where it cuts in and out of our perspective and Ruben’s was really fucking cool.

You from this quiet frantic looking scene to just a perfectly normal lively dinner when the sound is cut.

Really beautiful movie and I don’t think I will ever forget the last couple scenes. I cried so hard when he and Lou were in bed together.",k6zkca

hqdksqb,"In the second to last scene where he’s leaving her bedroom, he’s surrounded by instruments and musical equipment. The walls are literally packed with nothing but music. He wouldn’t be able to get away from it in that life, he’d always be on the outside trying to listen in.",k6zkca
grgbeay,I loved this movie. I was so uncomfortable and almost aggravated by the audio. Just mimics the smallest portion of what Ruben was feeling. So cool how they involved watchers into the hearing loss experience.,k6zkca
geq4i0g,"Wow, Riz Ahmed delivers a great performance in this beautiful movie. I noticed so many shots capturing sounds of simple things like winds moving through fields, insects chirping in the dark, planes moving in the sky and birds singing in the forest which really makes us appreciate such simple things that we usually take for granted. That scene with Joe and Ruben was fantastic, Joe really points it out well that Ruben stopped doing drugs with Lou entering her life but in the end she became very drug that he later became addicted too. Great sound design as well, those scenes after Ruben got his implants activated were so jarring and put a dagger through my stomach knowing how much pain he went through to make his condition even worse.",k6zkca
gvsdwxc,"I just want to say.. This movie was amazing.

I understand the situation with the deaf community.. But it felt way too harsh on Ruben. Getting his hearing partially back, doesn't prevent him from teaching deaf kids how to play the drums, nor does it mean he is back to what he used to be, which is obvious. 

I feel like the community situation represented the two extremes. Ruben, who is obsessed with getting things back to how they were in their prime and Joe, who accepts his deafness to the point of obsession as well. The scene where Ruben is fixing the roof is the perfect contrast. ""We have people who believe that deafness doesn't need fixing"" which is true and that's an amazing outlook in life. But Ruben got deaf from literally a moment to the other, his life was going great and then the ONLY place he can go, is a community that literally forces him to ditch his life. No car? No phone? Complete disconnection? That just feels like total isolation.. It's positive when you see everyone happy, but for someone like Ruben, his life doesn't revolve around being deaf, it only just changed to that.

That's why I feel like the ending is perfect.. He doesn't belong with the community because they clearly don't accept them. But his old life is never coming back either. He can carve his own path now, listen when he wants to and take it off when he needs peace. And that's just the perfect balance.",k6zkca
geu303o,"The breakup scene was sad yet somehow touching and beautiful. Very interesting to see how addiction is portrayed as something larger than being addicted to drugs, it can also manifest as an addiction to the chaotic and nostalgic past. By far the most powerful scene and in my opinion the climax of the whole film was the discussion in which the disappointed but sad deaf program director painfully tells Ruben to leave, with the very touching explanation that being deaf was merely a mental handicap, not something to be desperately fixed. It was definitely a very difficult decision that shows the deep loyalty of the instructor to the other deaf people at the commune as well as his uncompromising sense of integrity. Very powerful stuff.",k6zkca
gf4qx72,"The breakup scene at the end was heartbreaking. I didn't really see it coming, at least not in the beginning. If anything, she came across as needy, and I thought that he would be the one ready to move on. What do you think happened in the months that they were apart? He's fighting to get his life with her back and she's quickly moving on after 4 years?  I know that she was scratching but they seemed to really love each other.",k6zkca

gwjvna2,One of the most compelling movies I’ve ever seen! Riz Ahmed really solidified himself with this performance.,k6zkca
geux2qb,"Just the kick in the ass I needed. A drama about a drummer named Ruben who losses his hearing. Played masterfully by Riz Ahmed. Starts by kicking us right in the middle of his band's show. Loud noises, vibrant colors, a drunken crowd shot you can almost smell them. Just an overload of senses on screen. Cut to the next scene. Him waking up, drinking a green smoothie, doing some calisthenics, putting on some Jazz while he makes breakfast for his girlfriend. I haven't been so hooked in the first 5 minutes of a movie in a long time.

&#x200B;

The characters are all fleshed out. Three dimensional humans who have all been through some shit. Resilient, fighters who are still here making the most of their situation. Everyone in the film deserves a movie but this is Ruben's. 

&#x200B;

Not often do films come around that make you thankful for bad situations. 2020 has been rough, but were still here, making it through the best we can. ""Sound of Metal"" is just stellar and one of the best the year has to offer.",k6zkca
gfqcupc,"At the risk of sounding stupid, why did Joe get really upset when he caught Ruben fixing the roof? 

It goes without saying that this was amazing. I agree with everyone else about how it subverted my expectations. It's funny how we're so trained to expect certain things. I was expecting Lou to have to turn to crime to pay for his hearing equipment and an inevitable scene where he secretly gets jumped lmao. 

But what I got instead, a poetic character piece about accepting certain situations (along with being an ode to the deaf community) was way better! This probably is my movie of the year. It just took the whole year to see it!",k6zkca
gvtaj66,"watched this ahead of the Oscars and i enjoyed the movie so much. I really hope it gets to win in some of the categories it’s nominated in, especially sound editing. 

Riz did such an amazing job, and the final scene when he took off the implants and got to have that moment of stillness Joe was talking about almost had me in tears. Amazing name as well.",k6zkca
geuc9qg,"Just finished this film last night and WOW!! That ending!! Beautiful! I’m a recovering addict and so much of recovery is about surrendering your will and accepting the things you cannot change. I thought that ending scene represented that PERFECTLY. Talk about quite literally turning off the noise of the world, and FINALLY finding that stillness...but only once we surrender and accept that in which we can’t change nor control. Beautiful!!",k6zkca
gexg97m,"As someone who has hearing loss (but is not fully deaf), the film was quite emotional for me and certainly “rang true”, no pun intended. The scene where Ruben first realizes the first signs of trouble recall mine. It is terrifying when you realize that something is not quite right with your hearing. You almost want to deny it as a “one off”. That scene brought tears to my eyes.

One thing I am curious about: I always thought those who are 100% deaf have distorted speech because they can’t hear themselves talk. Am I wrong in that? I figured Ruben and/or the others at the ranch would follow this speech pattern but they didn’t. Not knocking the film but I expected their speech attempts (if any) to be different.

Anyway, Ahmed is an excellent and very intuitive actor...perfect for this role. I thought the actor who portrayed Joe, the head of the camp, was very moving and I’m not surprised to hear (again, no pun intended) that he comes from a deaf family. I was also not aware that the deaf community views those who get cochlear implants with some disdain. I didn’t know that was a thing. That option was presented to me when I first exhibited my own hearing loss but fortunately, it hasn’t gotten to that level yet.

TL;DR: as someone who is also hearing impaired, this film had a big impact on me. I also appreciate the fact that the film touched on other issues like addiction and wasn’t simply about hearing loss to the exclusion of all else.",k6zkca

Riz Ahmed was amazing as I had expected, I have no doubt he will get more and more leading roles. I hope he at a minimum gets an Oscar nod. I've been following him since I saw him in Nightcrawler and he's a pleasure to watch.

gf5degw,"Really solid movie with really solid acting. I love that Riz learned drumming and ASL for the role, that is commitment. He played the role to a T. Olivia was amazing as well. Olivia has the voice for the genre too which is awesome. I was expecting it to be a run of the mill metal band but they went somewhat post-metal/experimental with it, which as a fan of that type of music, and a musician myself, I was delighted to see.

It also resonated with me as I worked with children, two kids I worked with were deaf so I learned some ASL myself. It made me actually miss working with kids in general. I think at the end he realized that life actually made him happy, although he does miss the rock star life.

I did however think the ending was kinda obvious. It's not OBVIOUS but I've seen so many of these dramas that I was pretty sure she'd find a new life and he will throw a new life away to go to her, only to be disappointed. I was, however, shocked he took his hearing aids out. I hope that signals for him returning to working with the kids.

All and all, solid 8.5 out of me. Can see this being a best picture nominee for sure.",k6zkca

geoapyf,"I cried the entire time.  I’ve had hearing loss and I’m a musician.. it’s affected me for higher and lower tones, and mid is ok- volume is tricky, I need tv louder, music louder and conversations cannot be mumbled.. 

This movie spoke to my fears.. and the struggle of not being able to hear.  I’m lucky that mine does come back most of the time.. but there are days that go by when I wander in that quiet haze, struggling to hear the water in the shower, my own voice- doing anything I can to get a clear sound.  That resonated with me so deep down.  

Sleeping is the worst- they referenced that with him being up so early- that could be an addict thing too, though- I have no experience with that..  all I know is when I can’t hear and I sleep, I fear nothing will wake me.  I wear my watch with the vibrate alarm on all the time. 

This movie was so good, so very very good.  I’m disappointed in the ending- no tie in from the deaf community to the outside world.. deaf people are the outside world too- I find it impossible that he didn’t see another deaf person on his entire journey to Paris.. and the effect of once you learn something new you notice it everywhere HAD to happen..  but I’m still happy with it.

gh23mu6,"I was really expecting this to be my favorite film of the year and it almost was. But the more I thought of it after watching it, the more I realized some things were bugging me.

**Where's the music?**

* I thought the introduction at the beginning was disappointing. His band sounded amateur. Then there's the fact that we jump directly into the hearing loss part. We never really had a chance to feel for passion for music. At least I didn't. One shot of playing the drums doesn't emit that much emotion, it's not enough to show his connection to music. Apart from drumming a bit with the kids, that's the last we see of music and it doesn't make any sense. Maybe this was done intentionally, and we're supposed to see that he was a mediocre musician and the name of the film has nothing to do with music but>! with the metallic noises he hears at the end.!< But then where did he get the money to refurbish the van like that? It looked like an expensive van. Is it implied that it was Lou's dad's money? Because that looks like and 100k+ investment and that band doesn't sound like it would be making them a lot of money. If it was with her dad's money why doesn't she offer to take him to a specialist and maybe find a possible treatment?  Like at least try. I can't see this other than a convenient plot point >!for him to end up all alone at the end. !<

**His girlfriend**

* >!A  lot of telling instead of showing, again. We find out that most likely she's been the reason he's sober but she doesn't seem supportive now.  She just kind of abandons him? The way they communicate after he finds out he's going completely deaf is nonsense. If they had such a strong relationship but she just picks up her things and orders a car to the airport without discussing him first? Why, how? I wish they included a part where she at least struggles with the idea of leaving him.!<
* >!I thought him being a musician would be a much bigger deal of the story l but it's not about the music at all. It turns out he's getting cochlear implants for her, for the girlfriend who abandons him and then moves to Paris without telling him.!<

&#x200B;

**The Deaf Community**

* >!He just fits right in. Sure, he shows some rage when he's in the writing room but other than he just learns to be deaf in a hot minute. One moment he's in a classroom not even knowing how to say his name in sign language, a few moments later he's signing perfectly and he's offered a  job at the center. The transition felt too smooth to me. It was the acting but the editing.!<

>!The implants!<

* >!Everybody brushes off that he's dead set into getting the implants. Nobody takes time to talk to him about it, apparently not even the doctors. The whole conversation with the implants doctor and the being release after a major surgery looks like a lawsuit waiting to happen. It sort of implies doctors some money-hungry vampires that split open your skull just like that. There are protocols, they give you disclaimers before the surgery, there's a recovery period in the hospital.!<

>!Being cast off from the deaf community!<

* >!Getting implants doesn't mean you automatically get back to hearing. Especially when the initial loss was that bad. Setting this aside, I do understand that people in the community don't want to treat it as a disability. But Ruben was clearly struggling with the idea of losing his hearing, he mentioned the implants right and the beginning and people don't just magically adjust to a completely new life just because he learned signed language. Writing in a  notebook every day is not therapy, and it doesn't help everyone cope with this kind of life-altering situation. Even Joe turned to alcohol in the beginning to cope, I feel like he's asking too much of Ruben. He needs time to accept what's happened to him.!<
* >!I totally understand and support not giving him the money to buy back the van. But throwing him on the street a day after having surgery, not having any place to go?  What kind of a person/community does that? If one person can jeopardize the entire community because they made a personal choice that sounds more like a cult than a support community. It's not like Ruben would be walking around there encouraging everyone to get the implants. He made a choice for himself. A choice that I thought was a bad idea not because I think implants are wrong or total acceptance of going deaf is right, but because he made the decision when he was desperate. It's a major decision that required research and knowledge and time to consider what's right for him. Not the community, not his girlfriend, but for him. I really think this part could have been done a bit better. I know it was done so he would feel he's all alone at the end and accept being in silence but it's kinda laid on thick.!<

**The girlfriend again**

>!How does he still money to travel to Paris after spending it all on the surgery?!<

* >!And when he gets there he finds out she's not really planning on being with him or moving back to America. I'm skeptical he would accept the break-up that calmly.!<
* >!I don't have an issue with her doing what's best for her happiness. It's the way she does it rubs me the wrong way. Maybe in the time apart she realized her mental health was worse on the road. But I do have an issue with how she left, very cowardly and that she didn't want to go back to their old life or be with him. He didn't need to find this out in Paris. She's such a selfish coward. She knew he asked her to wait for him. The issue I have with this arc is that the film is portraying her as a sympathetic character and that we should feel sorry for her but I don't think it's the case.!<
* >!At the end, it just seems like a romaticised version of what it would be like when we find out we lost everything. He got those implants because he thought their relationship would go back to how it was but in the end, when he realizes he has nothing, no money, no girlfriend, no community, no support, no future, he had no reaction at all. He's calm and composed and finally gets the meaning of ""The kingdom of God is in the silence"".  This seems like a cliche for me. !<

For me it was a good movie that had the potential to be great but wasn't because all of the above.",k6zkca

The film was directed so well; Darius Marder shows Ruben's isolation when he loses his hearing and then its progression after he gets his hearing back through framing. Paul Raci and Olivia Cooke give great supporting performances as well, but the real star of the film is the sound design. Whoever mixed and edited this film needs an Oscar immediately.

Seeing him lose his hearing while also losing his old life was heartbreaking but it was wholesome to see him briefly enjoy the community and embrace his deafness.

The absence of sound and how they made Ruben and the audience aware of how things would sound if he goes back to playing the drums was amazing. My heart sank when the church bells rang and it sounded like cymbals and he had to take off his device.

gi5fc34,"Unfortunately, I didn't boogie with this movie. It just didn't captivate or intrigue me. And it's not an instance of ""oh, I've seen something like this before that's lesser known and was done better."" I just simply... was bored. I'll try to explain:

I was a bit put off by the relationship of the leads in the opening. The scene where they're first driving and we're peering in from the back seemed like improv, which okay, great, but it seemed like it was from a place of a couple barely getting to know each other. At that point, I had no idea how long they've been together so I can't quite judge, but it turns out they've been together for 4 years. So off the bat, it's not entirely ringing true to me.

I feel like there's been talk of Riz Ahmed for a few years now being such a great actor. Am I missing something? Is he on a show that I just don't watch? Everything I've seen him in, he's been surface level at best. Venom and Rogue One are obviously the most mainstream and flat performances, but even in Nightcrawler I just thought ""yeah, he's decent."" And here, which I would say is his best performance so far, he still seems a bit performative like he's dramatizing his emotions a bit to be captured instead of naturally living the scenes as they go. A bit extra twitchy and eye move-y and such that some actors do to make it look like they're conveying an emotion instead of actually having one. I could get more into the technicalities of acting, but for the sake of simplicity, I won't.

The writing seemed a bit awkward with how people interacted with each other. Especially with how Ruben's character is at this place to cope with his hearing loss, he was pretty much a prick to everyone for the first half of the movie. He doesn't desperately do whatever he can to learn from others, instead he's scoffing and acting non-plus by everyone. He wants to go back to his old life, yet isn't willing to take the steps to get there? Dude just seemed like a douche for no reason, it didn't ring true, his behavior honestly didn't look like he'd willingly be there under any circumstances if that's how he acted, even if it was for his girlfriend.

I thought Paul Raci was pretty great, could definitely see him securing a nom for Best Supporting. I think he's one of my only main positives about this movie. At this point midway into the movie, my score is hovering around a 6 or a 5, but after Paul Raci's final scene (which is the scene I think could be his nom securing moment), this movie dipped to a 4 or a 3.5 for me as it suddenly nose dived into a place that just worked even less for me.

Olivia Cooke was... fine. I was waiting for her to have a really good moment. Her character didn't ring true to me either. The transition at the end to assimilating to that lifestyle just didn't seem believable. Their nomad/gypsy lifestyle before just seemed to cleanly be gone. While this happens to many people and they go through phases, I think the very idea that this was something she did for money, I don't see it easily being stripped clean from her personality like that. The ""old her"" seemed almost completely gone. Just a different look in her eyes all together and like a new character, which I'm sure is the point but in that time span it just felt like forced for the sake of the movie and to help jolt our lead's acceptance of his situation.

Speaking of which, the final scene of him just kinda coming to terms in some sort of way, learning to deal with his new situation and realizing his old life will never come back? The overwhelming sound of the bells seemed too easy. This dude went through a lot of turmoil, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, and did a whole lot just to retain that tiny bit of hearing. With what we've seen of his character's behavior before and his frustrations at that party and the way his girlfriend suddenly seems fine not living their old lifestyle, this acceptance coming in this moment felt fake for the sake of a movie moment. This would be something he'd be visibly frustrated with for years to come and seems like the actual thing he would NOT accept. Yet I'm supposed to believe he finds his moment of stillness in one scene? Comparing this to another drummer movie about obsession, Whiplash perfectly captured a dickhead we could root for because it was easy to understand him and care by seeing how willing he'd put up with shit. I don't think I ever understood Ruben or cared, because in the beginning he seemed so unwilling to do anything. Dude didn't even tell his girlfriend he went deaf until a whole day after.

And the whole ending in general was so lackluster compared to the rest of the movie. I was now realizing a lot of scenes throughout just came and went and happened without any impact to the rest of the story, or dragged even if the movie had a pretty decent pace in editing. It was around this point that I really wished we got to see the documentary this is based on instead as that would at least have some natural catharsis.

4/10, and if that's if I'm being generous. I can see myself forgetting I even saw this movie in a few days and dropping this to a 3. This Oscar season is already shaping up to be pretty terrible, but I guess that only makes sense considering its 2020 and coming off 2019 as one of the best.",k6zkca

gex7i0e,"I thought the sound design was great since so much of the story is told through that. I would like to know what deaf people think of the film, and I hope the subtitles were utilized to their fullest extent to communicate all the sound cues throughout.

The ending worked for me, but I wish that the story was about him dealing with him losing his hearing over a period of time. The opening scene had me thinking that we would be introduced to the character right in the middle (or even towards the end) of his hearing loss. But the film treats his predicament very quickly without him having any prior knowledge of some sort of hearing loss. Sudden hearing loss is a rare thing but it DOES happen, so there is a solid reasoning behind his hearing loss in the film. But it seems more fitting that a metal musician would be suffering from progressive hearing loss.

Also, I thought the credits should’ve been silent. The film starts with noise, and it ends with silence. Gives a good reason to keep that silence, and that feeling of calm, going into the credits.",k6zkca

gerobfp,"*spoiler*

Awesome movie. Character reactions seemed on point as far as being genuine. I liked that there wasn’t any random 180 being pulled where a character acts....out of character?....just for the sake of “a lesson learned”. Even though his experience in the home was relatively good, he ultimately still wanted what he originally strived for. At the end he seemed to *appreciate* his situation to a degree and in a realistic way under the circumstances.  Compared to the directors other movies (which I think are all incredible), this definitely can be considered the closest to a feel good ending.",k6zkca

geplecu,"There’s still a lot of movies I want to see like Black Bear, Nomadland, but I can already see this being one of my favourites of this year, I’ve been quite interested reading critiques from the deaf community as well as audiologists like an earlier comment here, as someone with hearing I took a lot of things at face value, for example the shock of how the implants sounded, the earlier comment about the discussions that would have been had are important, but in retrospect Ruben was so laser focused on getting his hearing back, that all he would have had to hear would be that “there’s a chance” and gone with it anyway. I’m someone who gets really anxious around too much noise, too many people talking over each other, abrasive sounds like alarms, and the scenes after he got the implants made me want to crawl out of my skin but it was incredibly effective. So many scenes stand out, but I loved the scene towards the end where he’s watching Lou sing at the party, sad and beautiful.

As others have mentioned I really enjoyed how this movie subverts expectations, I thought Ruben was going to hook up with the teacher, didn’t happen, thought he would stay at the school, didn’t happen which made the rest of the story more heartbreaking, he was really fitting in at the school and the kids seemed to like him, another movie would have tied that up with a happy ending, but threw you for a loop.

Kind of rambling here because I’m still processing how good this was, it’s felt like forever since I’ve watched a new film that really hit me in the gut like this one did, it’s not perfect of course, some scenes felt underwritten and the span of time was not clear, was he at the school for days, months?

>!When Lou and Ruben are talking on the bed and talking and she starts scratching her arms. Does that imply that Lou has started using drugs?

>!But also that he's letting go and telling her that it's okay to let go of their past? !<

gf90cqm,Riz Ahmed absolutely killed his role in this one. Good film although maybe a little too long (running time 120 minutes). I’m excited to see him in Mogul Mowgli which has gotten a bunch of good reviews in England. Does Anyone have a way to watch it in the United States?,k6zkca
geofk0z,"I watched this movie because I play the drums and love heavy music, so I went in for that reason alone, not hearing about this movie beforehand. I was simply looking for something to watch on a Friday night and this caught my eye on Amazon prime. I’ll be honest, I was pretty critical about the “metal” music at the beginning, but soon learned that wasn’t what this movie was about. Needless to say, this was quite a moving story. When it ended I was expecting more, but thinking about it more, it ended well. The “stillness” Ruben was in really speaks for itself. Seems like even though it seemed like he was getting better and even happier when staying at the home, in the back of his head he was still thinking about forgetting it all and chasing his old life which he thought would fulfill him. Even the look on his face in the last scene you can tell he’s learned and is still learning a lesson through all of it. Definitely will be recommending this to friends.",k6zkca

gv70x64,"God I hated Joe so fucking much. 

First of all, I can *maybe* understand taking away his RV keys. But taking away his phone and not letting him use the computer?? Completely cutting him off from his support system and what's going on in the outside world? Even prison inmates today are allowed visitors, letters, and limited computer time. I guess Joe wanted his home to be worse than prison.

And then of course there's *that* scene, which is just a classic case of Christian hypocrisy. When you're a newcomer, they'll roll out the red carpet for you. Give you food, a nice bed to sleep on, an education, a community, a home. They'll say they don't care about your past, or if you believe in their religion or their God. But if you do anything, absolutely *anything* that goes against their tightly-held beliefs, even when it affects nobody else, they kick you to the curb and tell you to pound sand. Even if you're broke, homeless, jobless, carless, and without family or resources. Because charity to people like Joe isn't about support. It's about control. Closed-mindedness at its finest.",k6zkca

gg5xzzu,"It was a great movie in terms of storytelling and character development, but I always find it hard to actually enjoy a movie when the main character is so unlikable. His only redemption is when he's with the kids and at the very end. Of course we know he is struggling with addiction and his new situation, and he has a very hard-headed personality, so most of this is part of his character and makes sense; I think what bothers me is just the way he puts a hard stop on every conversation and dialogue by just refusing to entertain any idea outside of his own. Of course, this still part of the character, but I think the tempo of some of the scenes where he is being non-compliant and angry started to bother me... there's just a large amount of time dedicated to showing him being an asshole to himself and others. It's hard to call this a fault of the movie, maybe I just have a hard time enjoying watching that play out.",k6zkca

alot of comments talking about how great this movie is in this thread, i agree w. most.

No asking of his heritage, how a brown guy is into metal at all, where the last name stone came from. Only the comment about where he's lived, and his mom being a military nurse.

First off, the intro scene was perfect and reeled me in from the start. I didn’t expect the hearing loss to occur so suddenly since it seemed like it all happened so fast but I remembered that’s how it really happens. I was completed absorbed in this movie and felt everything he felt. I love it when a movie can do that effectively. 

Riz and Olivia had very solid performances. Riz is one of my favorite actors and I kept forgetting it was him, he seems to have matured a lot and he really fit the role super well. 

I cried so many times during this movie. I started tearing up most at the end I think. The bliss... what a fucking movie. It is my personal movie of the year, although Swallow and The Invisible Man come very close",k6zkca
gwwyonc,"Really didn't like this movie, and I feel like I watched a different move compared to everyone who praises it. From a technical stand point it was rather impressive, assuming it was accurate to what people are actually hearing and experiencing. However, that mess of noise they call a song at the start of the movie was painful to listen to, well the singing at least. So I struggle to believe any more than a handful of people would listen to his ""band.""

Aside from that I am unsure of the message this movie is trying to send. Is it pro-deaf community and is trying to say deaf people shouldn't try to get surgery and treatment? Because I think that is a preposterous stance to take. Being deaf is the lose of a core sense and it is absurd to say it isn't a handicap.

I also found Ruben to be a bit hard to swallow in how much he was resistant to actually doing what was best and letting his ears rest. I also struggle to believe the surgeons didn't discuss with him before hand that his hearing would not be the same after surgery and give him realistic expectations so that he doesn't crash with his new reality like he did at the end. I won't speak much of his performance expect that it was good, but didn't find it as ground breaking as everyone is making it out to be.

This movie just seemed lacking in direction and really didn't fulfil the expectations these reactions set for it.",k6zkca
i83svio,"  Really great film! While the themes in the story aren't uncommon, everything was exceptionally executed. Great performances!

Whereas hearing through the typical acoustic pathways (sound through the air) is represented as a virtually continuous tonal spectrum, cochlear implants divide that range of pitches into ~20 discrete channels.

As a person who is not deaf/Deaf, I had wondered about some of the things you have talked about in this comment - especially potential dilemmas/tensions between identifying as deaf/Deaf, and I had also assumed that there would be rehab associated with the implants, and wondered whether this had been skipped over in the film when conveying how Ruben's changed hearing with it. Part of me was like ""surely there would be an adjustment period, and although his hearing won't be like before, it'll be better than now...""

It felt like there was quite a bit of judgement from Joe towards Ruben, after he got his implants - from my perspective it seemed unfair, as I could empathise with why Ruben made the decision he did, but I didn't know whether this was me not being empathic enough of the Deaf community.",k6zkca

He takes his brother for granted on that phone call anticipating what his brother will say. He takes his hearing for granted after the doctor tells him he needs to preserve the little hearing he has left. He takes the van for granted, he takes Lou and her family’s money for granted, he takes the program and the people in it for granted, and in the end he loses everything to get back something that isn’t as sweet as he once believed it was (his hearing). He fights so hard against all the change that’s happening to him and it’s after he loses it all that he’s able to sort of surrender to circumstance and accept who he is and what he is and be grateful for that. 

He burned those bridges with the program so I don’t think he’s going to return, I think he learned his personal lesson and he’s back at square one. If I were to guess I’d look to how he came out of rehab as an indication of what happens to him. He never relapsed, he found a new calling, he learned to live with a life long affliction.

I’m currently getting my AuD and shared many of your same thoughts, especially frustration with the complete lack of counseling and aural rehabilitation displayed throughout the film.

There are so many nuances within the Deaf community concerning feelings and responses to HAs/CIs so I was glad to see that the story didn’t take one “correct” side, so to speak. I did start to worry toward the end that the message was shifting more to shaming Ruben for choosing the implants - but I choose to believe that by the end, he was beginning to accept his new life and that will include balancing when to use the CIs and when to remove them to enjoy peace through quiet stillness.

The more I realize the film from the place of addiction and loss, the less annoyed I am by the blatant errors in audiology treatment (i.e. not explaining how hearing via implants greatly improves over time). But I still definitely had that same initial reaction of defensiveness for our field and the care we take to ensure no one ever is under a false impression of unrealistic results. 

All that aside, this is now one of my favorite films and I’m elated to see it nominated for so many Academy Awards.

ETA: I’m also a musician (specialty: hearing conservation for musicians) that played hundreds of gigs in my youth without any sort of hearing protection and am grateful to have the hearing I still do. In my memory, Ruben was never wearing in-ear monitors or plugs of any kind. This still isn’t likely to cause sudden bilateral HL like you said, but I thought it was worth mentioning that he appeared to be playing drums unprotected. So to echo you...

The implants don't sound good, and it seems like they are only necessary if you want to interact in a world where people don't speak sign language. He could live at peace in the entirely deaf community he was in, but live in a tiny world, or tolerate the annoying sound of the implants to necessitate being able to communicate with people in a non-deaf world which is a lot bigger and potentially has more opportunities in it.

It's basically like, if you live in a world where no one spoke your language, would you withdraw yourself to a smaller community that understands you, cutting off ties to the rest of that world, or would you be willing to tolerate a painful and annoying device that lets you communicate, albeit very slowly with the rest of the world, where you'll still be seen as ""different"" and a bit of an outcast.

ghter5b,"Tbh I actually was happy it didn't turn into a movie all about music -- and I say this as a drummer myself. I think we too often end up getting movies where some sort of passion saves the MC and I just don't think we needed it here. Nor am I dying for another tortured artist film. Having a deep connection to music wasn't really meant to be a focal point here, in my opinion. Although I gotta say, being in an amateur band and touring all on your own is enough to show me how important music is to you because that shit is tough as hell. But yeah, overall it was definitely more a vehicle that transformed into the literal sound of metal, ie the CIs. I'm glad that it simply grappled with his life as a whole. Music is deeply important to me, and it helps me a lot to cope with my depression. But at the end of the day when you're coping with a mental illness, it really is just a blimp in the overall chaos of your mental health -- which is very clear with how quickly he starts selling his gear just to fund the CIs. So I'm glad it stayed in the background but was more of a subtle element throughout the movie, including the ending where listening to his girlfriend singing was really the final kick in the knees for him to realize that the CIs aren't going to fix everything, and certainly not his connection to music. 

But in regards to his girlfriend, I totally agree. I don't know if I was even supposed to sympathize with her, but I overall ended up not liking her very much. I was pretty surprised that when he went back she didn't even seem to have learned a lick of ASL. I learned a bit of ASL just to interact with my coworker, let alone a loved one. And the way she talked about their ""little gypsy"" life made her come off as a truly a bratty rich girl. Maybe if they had fleshed her out more I could have cared more, but her talking that way even after learning about her life solely through the dad's sitdown didn't do much for me. The strong co-dependent vibes of that whole relationship just didn't feel thoroughly fleshed out, and it probably should have been considering that it felt like he was practically addicted to her yet accepted the end of the relationship so well. 

So yeah I think the relationship overall is what knocked it down a few points for me. I stilled loved it, but if that area were stronger it'd be a top film for me. I think the movie tried to tackle a lot of things here, and it did some of those things better than others. I appreciate the ambitiousness, but it, unfortunately, couldn't hit the mark on the many topics it brings up.",k6zkca
gh8r39x,"I am hearing/speaking, the casting out and exclusionary aspects of the deaf culture are what stopped me from studying ASL beyond two years. Personally, I don't like the way the culture(in large) does not accept that technology and scientific advancement can add layers to ones life. I had to wrestle with the debate for years before I landed where I did. But I took implants to be similar to a prosthetic leg or lasik surgery or a gripping hand or any other scientific advancement that allows one creativity and fluidity. Yes. learn sign and communicate but that is not independent. One can also get implants and still communicate via sign. I hated that aspect of deaf culture.       
Like any culture some in the deaf community do not shun but then again many do.

Thanks for the write up. I watched it today and it’s a movie that will stick with me a lot. I’ve seen various documentaries and films about Deaf Culture and so I was expecting some conflict there. The Paul Raci character was phenomenal. He had the right mix of compassion, tough love, and discipline needed for what he was doing to help all those people.

I think maybe what I was left with was just.... sadness at the end. Like, as soon as he lost his hearing, his life changed. Seriously changed. And he was poor and didn’t have any real support to navigate through something traumatic like this. From all sides - hearing friends and family, to true support from his new deaf community.

He made a choice to get the implants and once you do that, there’s no going back. Of course there would never be a miracle where his hearing comes back, but with the implants that’s it. Your natural ears will never work again. And his disappointment with the sound of the implants is so painful to see. I think like many, we expect this massive joy to overwhelm the person getting the implants; we’ve all seen the videos of the babies hearing their mother’s voice for the first time... but in reality it’s not miraculous. Just functional at best. At least that’s how they portrayed it in the movie.

So what happens now? If he was at heart a musician (which as you mentioned was not well established), can he continue? Probably not. (Although insert joke about noise metal here. ha.) The end is left totally open. Will he continue to use the implants? Is he giving up on life? What’s he going to do now??

In the end I was very moved by this but not in a normal way. Just a supremely thought provoking movie (especially for a musician myself - thinking, “what would I do?”). What more can you ask of a movie though? I appreciate that at least.",k6zkca

You could at least throw in some funny/sympathetic moments in there like self-deprecating jokes or whatever. The closest thing to uplifting was when he drummed with that kid, but then it also felt pretty sad too. Like you said, I watched the trailer and synopsis and I thought the deafness would be something gradual, so when the movie shows him going blind at the 10min mark I thought it would just be tinnitus/a warning. But nope, it's all a tragic downhill from there.",k6zkca
gf118q2,"I think it's a matter of what information he was willing to actually listen to. In the first scene with a doctor he ignores the instructions around following up and running more tests. He wanted a quick fix to solve his problem.

I think it's very in line with his outlook and approach to life too. I think that scene were hes told that he doesn't have to fix things around the house, and him not understanding why, is indicitave of that same mentality.",k6zkca
getdeb1,"I think the way I saw it, it makes sense because even if the film did show the doctors explaining everything (not sure this makes sense from a cinema POV, would've been bland exposition), he would've just glossed over it anyway because as Paul Raci's character tries to tell him, it's that stillness and the quiet that will never leave a man. Ruben's always focused on the wrong things, which is in part because of his addiction.

Even if the film did show those scenes, I don't think Ruben's reaction would've been any different. Him selling his RV is pretty desperate.",k6zkca
gexguuq,"Good point. I am hearing impaired (but not fully deaf) and explored the possibility of cochlear implants at one point. During my first consultation, it was explained to me that the implants aren’t an instant “fix”....that you must essentially relearn how to hear again and process sounds. Your brain has to adjust. The film could have done a better job of explaining that. To those who aren’t familiar, the process might be a bit confusing.",k6zkca
gg5c7pi,We see from his earlier scene with the doctor that he only hears what he wants to hear. So it's quite possible he was warned about the effects of the implant and just ignored them or didn't hear them until he actually experienced the sound for himself.,k6zkca
gf0w3x2,If wouldn't make it an interesting story if it was explained. The movie would have ended right there.,k6zkca
gg8yxgb,"The fact that no detailed explanation is shown is irrelevant as it wouldn't have mattered. I think there's a parallel between his addiction and his desperate search for a fix, the implants, which he believes is all he needs to get his old life back.  The movie drives the point that he's in denial and nothing would've mattered.

Btw, Imo, the ending was a graphic representation of the Serenity Prayer:

God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, 
courage to change the things I can, 
and wisdom to know the difference",k6zkca
gfb59zd,"Yeah, a relative of mine got a cochlear implant and it does sound like that. She ended up getting migraines all the time.

grma9au,"During the deaf cult I was thinking similarly, good but not amazing, and was a bit of a drag. Picked up when he gets the implants and then it got a lot better for me. Nowhere near Parasite though. I don't think it's Best Picture material but Riz Ahmed *has* to win Best Actor",k6zkca
gr7dqcs,"> but does anyone feel like this movie wasn’t as good as the hype

found your reason why, don't watch movies because you feel like you have to, it's better if you were interested in them",k6zkca
grm9vdb,"I just watched this movie and I agree with you. There were some good things about the film, like the sound editing, Riz Ahemd's/ Raci's overall performances, and the portrayal of the deaf community and its controversies over cochlear implants, but overall, I felt the movie was reaching for something and didn't quite get there.

It was the type of movie where you are dropped into a situation and you had to connect the dots in a much-less supported way than other wonderful films. For example, I'm not sure why they had him go to a rehab facility when he had been clean 4 years and did not seem to be using or on the verge of using again. Now, it's true in real life, stress can cause someone to fall back into old negative patterns but that was an assumption I had to make and not one the movie showed or even really hinted at. Another example is when Lou left: it wasn't clear where she was going, why, etc. If her relationship with him was so close, why'd she leave so abruptly? Then why did he turn up all of a sudden at her home? 

Like you, I really enjoy movies and watch the whole gamut. What I've found over time is that writing really matters to me: if the plot lines aren't clear, then that significantly diminishes the film, even though I've enjoyed movies where I know the plot is formulaic and  I watch because of a specific actor or for the cinematography. I often find that movies/ TV shows that are popular/ hyped, I don't find that original or thrilling. Most recently, I watched 2 episodes of ""The Queen's Gambit"" and gave up. I was also not impressed by the films Roma (except for its cinematography), The Irishmen, A Star is Born, Call Me By Your Name, etc. Different strokes for different folks!

If you enjoyed Parasite, check out that director's earlier movie ""Mother."" (no, not the one with Jennifer Lawrence) I saw it years before Parasite and was thrilled by it.  One thing I really miss - and I'm dating myself here - are IMDB's original movie discussion boards. Occasionally, I find myself watching movies from decades ago (made way before I was born): with less cash and flash, the plots are much tighter. Some of my all-time faves are Fritz Lang's ""M"" , 'The Visit"" with Ingrid Bergman, ""D.O.A."",  ""Double Indemnity"", 'Rope"", ""The Bicycle Thief"", ""Le Samourai.""",k6zkca
guxck2x,"I feel like the movie really lost momentum around the second half started when Ruben suddenly decides to get the implants. Like as it was playing out; it felt like the movie was punishing Ruben for not sticking with the Deaf Community and that he was bound to fuck up because he was a former addict riding off the emotion alone. The fact he was a musician didn't seem to matter in the grand scheme of things. 

So much about what I respect about the film is technical. The editing, the sound design/editing/mixing, the naturalist direction, Riz Ahmed and Paul Raci being fantastic. But the plot feels very...hallow and misleading to a degree.",k6zkca

gfxi4a7,"When implants first came out, there was a period where the community was very anti-implant (1990's - 2000's). In the past 10 years there has been a major opinion shift. Most Deaf people are accepting of deaf people with implants, and the prevailing philosophy for deaf children is ""do both"" i.e. an implant (for a spoken language) and also a sign language. 

Only stubborn Deaf militants and older Deaf folks are still anti-implant. It's a reputation we have that we're trying to get rid of, but the belief we're all like that is still super common unfortunately.",k6zkca
gfl1zpd,"Yes, but its a complicated issue. I'm not deaf but I had a friend who was and got cochlear implants.

gfop3bo,"In the context of the film, I assume the community wouldn't actively shun Ruben for getting the implant, but his presence alone would hinder the whole operation. Imagine if someone just like Ruben arrived for his first day there and saw Ruben in the process of getting his implant. The new guy would never buy in to what the deaf community is trying to teach. And also like Joe said, Ruben would just be a walking reminder to everyone that they can't hear when that particular commune is supposed to be a safe space for them.

gf6w7ln,"she has a history of self harm and also dermatillomania  (aka ""excoriation disorder"" to console herself (often a result of anxiety), I have had issues with dermatillomania so I recognized it right away - it can manifest as scratching of skin/scalp, picking at certain things like nails compulsively etc. I don't think it's her ""addict"" side coming out, though it's definitely a compulsive habit often used to self-soothe it is unrelated to drug-use (clarification: not always, but in this case I believe it is unrelated). so I interpreted that to mean that her life on the road was causing anxiety (she was still scratching at that time), and she was doing much better in France because she hadn't been scratching...so her old life coming back through Rubi was almost instantaneously causing anxiety (not to mention the massive changes they had just endured). just wanted to add another perspective.

&#x200B;

I 100% don't think she started using, she was much healthier and doing better...he's saying ""it's okay,"" because he realizes that she doesn't want to continue their relationship and go back to their old life but doesn't have the heart to say it because she loves him so much - he sees her anxiety and has the mature realization that he needs to let her go for her own wellbeing, even though he still loves her and probably feels like he needs her...it's the most mature radical decision he makes in the movie, he is accepting the situation and taking responsibility for his own life, and recognizing that their paths have diverged...it's a really beautiful, painful moment.",k6zkca

Most humans--I imagine--would become angry and frustrated if such a devastating and life-changing circumstance happened to them.,k6zkca
gg94ljk,Of course he will resist everything. Losing a hearing is not something you get used to immediately you’ll be in denial and angry for a long time. I thought he showed every bit of it,k6zkca
gmidsjx,"You're kidding?   I found him extremely likeable.   Sudden hearing loss?  His angry way of dealing with it and being in denial does not make him unlikeable.  It makes him human, terrified, frantic, in denial, not able to accept it.  He is an addict.  He had turned his life around, but staying clean in those early years would not have been easy and would be in a fragile place.  All of a sudden, the world as he knew it was being stripped away from him.

Dave Gahan, of Depeche Mode, was an addict until the mid '90s.  He's been clean for decades.   But he said when he fell ill on tour in 2007 and was diagnosed with cancer,  he wanted to finish the tour and address the cancer later.  Their tours are massive and responsible for a lot of people.   The doctor looked at him and told him they had caught it early.   He was lucky.But he  had to be operated on immediately.   He admitted it was the junkie in him that went into complete denial until facing reality.  He did get operated on, a month off, and back on tour, doing chemo during the tour.   But he has always acknowledged how incredigly fragile his sobriety was those first four or more years.   

So imagine falling deaf quickly and the things that make sense in your life are stripped away, you career and all contact has been cut off from your main emotional support?",k6zkca

They weren’t successful, idk where you got that from. They had a niche following, if you paid attention when they were setting up the merch for the show, Ruben said you don’t need to put all of them out bc obviously they’re not going to sell out.

And the message was that you don’t have to view being deaf as something that needs a cure. Sure, science should continue looking for one, but for those that can’t afford it, they should instead look to finding new meaning, purpose and stillness in it.

Ruben was in a panic driven frenzy to get his hearing fixed, and the whole point of the camp was to show him he needs to calm down and learn that how to be deaf and how to still live a meaningful life with it.",k6zkca
hm32mkc,"Aside from the story telling aspect of him playing in a noise band and the movie being about finding stillness, I think it's completely believeable that this band could become big.

This kind of music is pretty common in the underground scene (where normal concerts regularly range between 50-500 people). At every hardcore show you have some obscure noise/grindcore band and people buy their stuff because it's interesting art for some or their shirts look rad. They're supposed to be avantgarde. 

And that's without considering the internet as the powerful tool it is to get music out to people everywhere in the world.

I don't think everyone has that same reaction to implants, maybe for some it's a more jarring adjustment than others. Maybe for many they are simply an annoying necessity to help them get through life but would totally prefer a silent world if everyone around them spoke sign language. 

I thought the movie did a great job trying to convey that. Ruben was chasing something that couldn't be restored, his old life, his girlfriend, his music, his hearing, this blinded him to what seemed to be a lot of warning signs that the surgery was maybe not the best move for him.

For me,I understand that that community can be such a help for recovering addicts, so the metatextual symbolism of ""metal music"" as ""salvation"" was there for me.  So when he lost his salvation he had to start over again.  I agreed that I would have liked to see more of why - why is metal/noise/etc. Music so transformative for many people?  I think that would have helped give credence to the genre.

geucwao,Like he briefly told his sponsor on the phone in the diner “serenity happens once you stop trying to change the past”. He was in what we call in recovery “self-will run riot”. Recovery from addiction is about surrendering our will and accepting what we cannot change. The first part of the serenity prayer goes “god grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change”. Instead of accepting what he couldn’t change he went to drastic measures to try to change it (i.e selling his RV/home),k6zkca

Try and tell me it isn't a disease, when the main character just feeds into those same feelings, no matter the source.  Always looking for a way out, or the best solution, not realizing what you're losing in the process.

My girl always has questions about my past.  When Joe asked him to just sit in a room and write, she paused to ask why he would ask him to do that.  I nearly quoted one of those AA catchphrases, but I just said that there is nothing more terrifying to an addict than being alone with their thoughts.

ghrvrbg,"Late to the discussion but I thought Joe’s reaction was understandable, and he didn’t really have any other choice but to make him leave or else he would sacrifice the entire philosophy of their group home. The capital D Deaf community is very adamant that you can live just as good of a life without the ability to hear, and over the time Ruben was living there with them we saw him start to acclimate to their way of life and find a “new normal,” and even new ways of living that would not have been accessible to him before - a whole new path opened up to him working with the Deaf kids. (Also I’m surprised it was never brought up that he could still be a drummer. Drumming is like the one instrument that’s totally compatible with deafness because it’s all about rhythm and feeling vibrations.) Life there wasn’t any worse than before, it was just different. He was welcomed by everyone with open arms and brought into the community and shown all the beautiful parts of their way of life, and by choosing to get the implants in spite all of that he was basically saying that all of the love and acceptance and community he had found there was not good enough, and he would give all that up just to go back to how things were before. I don’t think he was kicked out for not buying into their “dogma,” I think Joe felt really betrayed and hurt by Ruben’s rejection and he didn’t want to share with the rest of the home that Ruben had ultimately decided their way of life was inferior.",k6zkca
geunuwe,"No, there is nothing wrong with that. But that's why he can't stay with that group. That place is supposed to promote that being deaf is not a handicap.

As an example, I can think of the scene where he's having dinner in the deaf community and we hear silence and see everyone around him gesturing in sign language. The film cuts to the same scene with full sound and the viewer gets a new experience in ""hearing"" this conversation of a dinner table at a deaf community.

It really felt like there was misguided empathy. Joe was kind to him in the process to ""accept his deafness"" but not in the process of re-connecting with his older life. Of course his girlfriend will lose the connection with him if he can't even communicate with her consistently.. And that's because doing that was prohibited for some reason. 

I'm not saying he should've returned to his older life, it's clear things have changed and I find it perfect he realizes that in the end. I just didn't like the way he was treated in the community, by Joe. If his speech about him losing his family because of alcohol, was true.. Then he has no right to hold back Ruben and force him into deafness. Nor is he ever returning to full hearing, anyway.. He only has the ability to slightly hear in calm environments and only if he's wearing the hearing aid. 

In any case, Ruben lost his girlfriend because Joe prohibited any chance for him to even contact her.

I get the line of ""You sound like an addict"" with the whole money situation, because he was. But he never relapsed back into drugs.. He had been high on life for 4 years now, ever since he met Lou. He wasn't going to start doing shit to himself and ruin his relationships. He just needed to figure shit out, which he does.. Only it's too late to keep his relationship, by then. He's just thrown into a situation where no one is there to truly support his ideals.. To support the process of figuring out his next step, the way he wanted to. It's very sad.",k6zkca

For people struggling with addiction and other mental illnesses (not sure what it was for Lou but I got the impression she had depression), I think it represented the care they had for each other and the comfort the relationship provided. They clearly supported each other in a time they needed one another. Lou only left because she was afraid him relapsing would cause her to do the same, and because he wouldn’t have gone to the community otherwise. Their relationship wasn’t sustainable but they had a lot of love for each other, and I think that’s exactly what their breakup acknowledged.

You say don't have time to address all of these but you took the time to write how these make perfect sense to you, hm. It's not that you don't have time, but that you can't come up with any counterarguments.

The film doesn't hold hands or expect you to walk toward certain explanations? That's exactly what it does with the most important theme.>! Ruben is told he is behaving like an addict because he got the implants and then shunned. His girlfriend betrays him in the most cowardly way so he could learn that the ""Kingdom of God is in the silence"". It lays it thick in the message that he should have stayed in the community, not turn to medicine or try to go back to how it was. He didn't so he ended up alone and outcast. But when he finally embraced his situation and took off the implants, he found peace. It's not subtle, at all. The ending could also be about the bigger picture, about the fact that no matter your circumstances you can always find solace in meditation which leads to inner peace but it's harder to accept this conclusion considering the rest of the journey.!<

It works in the sense that he felt that same sense of security at the start of the film when he was surrounded by complete noise. He has finally begun to accept his new predicament.

The first doctor makes a point to say (paraphrasing here), it doesn't matter how it happened, whether it was caused by his profession, drugs, or an autoimmune disease. What mattered was realizing his hearing wasn't coming back.

This was an important line. The movie isn't about actions having consequences, it's about the fact that sh\*t happens in life, and we have a choice in how we respond.

>Also who TF would want to regularly sit there and do nothing. If it's meditation then okay but otherwise sounds boring.

I took this as more finding inner peace.  Ruben was clearly a guy trying to keep busy to avoid thinking about his current situation.  From a mental health aspect, he needed to come to terms with the situation, that his life had taken a dramatic turn, and make peace with that before he would be able to move forward in a healthy way.

I agree. I imagine plenty of deaf people would disagree, but I think this is a situation where no one is unbiased. As hearing people (I assume you're hearing), we think hearing is critical to life. But for many deaf people, silence is their life and they might view someone getting a cochlear implant as trying to tell them they have a disability. Not a perfect comparison, but I get the sense it's kind of like if there were a ""gay cure"", or in a movie sense the cure for mutants in X-Men 3. 

> Also who TF would want to regularly sit there and do nothing. If it's meditation then okay but otherwise sounds boring.

To WANT to sit around and do nothing is kind of odd. But I think it is critical to be ABLE to do that. Be alone with your thoughts.

I’m sure that, like any responsible physician, the doctor provided education on the procedure and outcomes, including risks and appropriate expectation-setting. Ruben, however, comes off as someone who thinks it’s a “cure,” and thus doesn’t care about the details.

ggqdal1,"Implants on day 1 are not how implants work or sound long-term. Most people take atleast 1 year to fully adapt to them, if not longer.

Sound becomes much-much-much better once you are more adapted. It just doesn't make as dramatic of an ending for the movie to show/explain that.

gvnmmz8,"It's for a few reasons. But as a general background, it's important to distinguish the community between deaf and Deaf (the capitalization). Lower case d deaf is just normal people with hearing loss. Capital D Deaf is very pro-Deaf, and what most of my comments below refer to. Capital D Deaf people treat lower case deaf people as they should be ashamed of being ""little d"" and as a lower type of person. There's also a hierarchy of how ""generationally Deaf"" someone is, as if having more generations of hearing loss makes them better people. 

Capital D Deaf is the norm in most Deaf universities and schools, but in the real world there's more deaf people (and hard of hearing people). But Capital D Deaf usually form local Deaf communities and are more organized than deaf people (and kind of strong-arm deaf/hoh out of the communities). 

Number 1: Doctors used to push implants when hearing families had random deaf kids, and the Deaf community sees it as ""stealing their Deaf identity."" Doctors didn't also push for families to bother with sign language, so they don't like that. 

Number 2: As implants (and hearing aids) got better.... people don't really bother with sign language or the Deaf community as much anymore. Rates of usage for ASL drop every year.

Number 3: The Capital D Deaf community sees deafness as a gift, not a disability. Any attempt to ""fix"" your hearing loss is seen as you not accepting this gift and letting hearing people shame you into trying to ""fix"" it in an attempt to suck up to the hearing world.",k6zkca

Recovery probably depends a lot on factors like how it happened, how young you are, etc. My particular tinnitus was caused when I was in my early 20s by sudden, unexpected loud noise trauma to one ear. My cousin threw one of those pop pops at me and as I tried to dodge it with a duck, it hit me right in the ear. I heard the start of the bang, then I remember a hiss as it sounded like my ear decompressed. That hiss was followed by a super high pitched tone that didn't let up for 2-3 years. Nearly drove me crazy. Saw multiple specialists about it. They said they couldn't detect any hearing loss. I remember I had an assignment to write the worst screenplay I could imagine in a class and I wrote one about a guy getting tinnitus in one ear. The high pitched noise in the movie would get progressively louder in one channel throughout the film until the main character offed themself. The point of the assignment was that it is very hard to intentionally write a terrible screenplay. But, my professor had to admit mine sounded like the worst she'd ever read. My tinnitus slowly faded away as either the inner workings of my ear healed or my brain started to filter out the frequency that was constantly stuck on. (I suspect the former)",k6zkca

gukv2cs,"Ha! Thanks for the compliment. I'm too busy to keep a blog but I've been watching movies for close to 5 decades now and at one point in my 20s read movie reviews constantly.

One place I look for interesting films is the The Criterion Collection, although not every movie there I've liked and some can be on the extreme end of pretentiousness. (I'm not a Terence Malick fan.) Nevertheless, I did find older/ digitally remastered gems there I had never heard of like Port of Shadows (1938), Black Orpheus, Rififi, A Simple Plan, Elevator to the Gallows, etc. there. I look at film awards beyond the usual Academy, Golden Globe, BAFTA, Sundance, etc. to the Cannes, Golden Bear (Berlin), Cesar (France), Golden Rooster (China), etc. awards. 

Sometimes I'll become fan of a particular director, cinematographer, actor, etc. and try to watch everything they make over their career. Directors I like which aren't perhaps as well- known to the mainstream US audience  include Guillermo Del Toro, Ang Lee, Zhang Yimou, Louis Malle, Claude Chambrol, Majid Majidi, Mira Nair, etc. Actors like Daniel Bruhl or Matthias Schonaerts or Kristin Scott Thomas or Carey Mulligan or Ryan Gosling. More lately I've honed into screenwriters both original and adapted as well. 

My profession is in the sciences but before that, I had considered writing and visual arts (photography, drawing, etc.) as a career so that feeds into my love of the movies. There a surprising amount of hype in both the arts and sciences and trends that come and go but over time, you learn to develop your own views and tastes, regardless of what is considered popular.",k6zkca

Plenty of rehab programs do this. It's because there is no other way to make sure you're not communicating with people who you shouldn't (like those who you were using with, etc.). The program there was to help him accept becoming a Deaf person and that's what Joe told him. It's easier to do that if you aren't still attached to your past self. Plus, it's only temporary. 

Now, you could say it's cruel to evict him at that moment, maybe.

Ruben went to extreme measures, but even then the hearing aids didn't fix his ears. He tried so hard to resist the current of life, but he eventually comes to accept his hearing, and in continuing the metaphor, he accepts that Lou has also gone her own way. 

The final scene represents him coming to terms with this. He removed the hearing aids and simply sits, peaceful in acceptance. 

It's not to say that ""defying the odds and never giving up"" isn't admirable, or a worthwhile story, but that wasn't the focus of this film. Furthermore the theme is explored with the parallels to addiction and the mantra of serenity.

gvabz6j,"I hear what you’re saying. But at the root of it is compulsion. He needed to get rid of the compulsion and ‘addict behavior’. They say that drug addicts, sex addicts and people who binge eat all have the same type of chemical imbalance.

In the same way, Ruben compulsively fixing the roof means that he still has the traits of addict behavior - the need to be doing something rapidly. He is replacing alcohol with fixing the roof. Therefore, if he is ever near drugs or alcohol again, he could easily fall back into it, because he still has that behaviour pattern.

So the goal was to break that compulsivity and just have him sit there and be ok not doing anything. So if he is near drugs and alcohol in the future, it will be easier for him to resist.",k6zkca

In addict recovery its usually encouraged to go without dating for your first year that you are clean because any mistep in that relationship can lead to a relapse.

When it comes to this film, if Ruben’s hearing loss was attributed to something similar to your experience, I feel like the movie could have been about a former addict who wasn’t a rock musician. The emotional catharsis of the film is when he feels “grounded” after taking off the CIs. It works in the sense that he felt that same sense of security at the start of the film when he was surrounded by complete noise. He has finally begun to accept his new predicament. But the journey there feels like one that should’ve had his identity as a musician built into the story more than just the scene of him drumming on the slide with the one kid or on the buckets in the classroom with the children. He could’ve even just been a lover of metal with the way the movie tells the story.

I don't think Joe's program is the same drug addicts program either, the issue is totally different. Joe desires about getting back his ears it's fine and understandable.

On the other side, I agree with Joe that Robin took an addict desicion: he sold everything to get back his drug (sounds), and then he regretted doing that.

The trailer represented the movie well, again giving you the outline of what happens.  A musician goes deaf and struggles with the reality of this news.  That’s all the trailer provides us.  And he does embrace the community, and finds happiness, he just can’t help but shake his past, so he takes a route you disagree with, and that makes it disgusting?

He was still working on it at the end – he’s only human. But the whole point was that he DID find peace and community at the rehab for the Deaf, left it to “fix” himself, and then realized this wasn’t something he could fix, or that needed fixing. That he could live a good life without his hearing. Maybe he will find a way to play drums again, but the point wasn’t about him getting back to his old life.

gfnfrxe,"The argument of how CIs are erasing Deaf culture is based around how many who are born deaf or become deaf later in life receive these implants as “magic cure” and never lean into their deafness. Many hearing parents who have a deaf child will get CIs for their children when they’re infants and never teach the child any form of sign language, which is obviously a massive key in Deaf culture.

I personally believe that Rueben was a perfect example of the erasure in the movie. He’s so dedicated to getting his hearing back and fixing it that he neglected the opportunity to really open himself up to Deaf culture and how you can live a perfectly functioning and normal life as a Deaf man. Granted I’m not saying it was a malicious act like he was committing genocide against Deaf culture nor do I necessarily believe CIs do just that.

All in all it’s an incredibly nuanced and difficult topic even within the Deaf community, with many Deaf people supporting each side as well as plenty in the middle. I highly recommend looking into the situation as it’s incredibly interesting.

Now unless I’ve misunderstood you along the way, I think it’s incredibly demeaning to argue that anyone who thinks differently from you about CIs is idiot just because they might share a difference of opinion, especially when the opposing opinion is incredibly common amongst those in the Deaf community based off their own life experiences.",k6zkca

I don't think it's something you really can have a recording of to show hearing people what it sounds like, as there's no way to verify.

The re-learning is normally more complicated for people that have been fully deaf their whole lives or for many years, as the parts of the brain that process hearing either never grew or have atrophied greatly. If your hearing loss is more recent, the recovery is alot shorter.",k6zkca

Please factor in that my memory is horrible and obviously I only have seen a fraction of films & series in my life so you could probably extend the list a lot. But if you think about any war movie (grenade exploding scenes) or literally any movie about Beethoven you will get very similar transitions of sound (from silence to chatter/noise/loudness) to make the audience feel the difference between reality of sound and the perception of (temporarily or permanently) hearing impaired person.

Lots of that kind of stuff involved haha. Hearing people can still hear wayyyyy better than implanted even if the hearing tests say “perfect” hearing. Hearing tests just show that you’re hearing in that frequency, not how many different sounds in that frequency you can hear.

You are good at what you communicate and your are valid in this interaction. Bye",k6zkca
