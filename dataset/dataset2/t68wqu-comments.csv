hz9zdrr,"I went in blind seeing this, only knowing that it was a Japanese film and that it had major awards buzz. When the movie started and I saw that it was about an actor and a TV writer, I immediately thought ""oh here we go again, another movie that gets Oscar buzz because it's about actors, and there's nothing they love more than movies about actors and show business.""

I was completely wrong. what a phenomenal movie and absolutely deserving of all the love. maybe it was the fact that I was in the theater and had to read subtitles and to made me have to completely focus on the film, but the scene with Yusuke and Koji in the car, where Koji continues the story that Oto was telling was one of the most intense scenes ever put on film, and it's literally just two men talking in a car.

absolutely cannot recommend this movie enough",t68wqu
hzfy77i,"I was captivated by the actress that used Korean sign language. Her story with her husband was the sweetest thing ever.

It’s filmed very matter of fact, but that let’s the performances of the actors come through.  Letting the emotional climaxes play out in two stationary long takes made them so much more powerful.

hz9xda1,"Hell yes I’ve been waiting for this thread! 

Wow, what a movie. So much to unpack—on grief, the creative process, acceptance. I was really blown away by this one. It really is epic in scale, when you consider the sheer amount the film tries to tackle. 

What really keeps the whole thing together is Hidetoshi Nishijima’s performance. He’s absolutely marvelous. A really quiet, understated, but intense performance. I really loved what he was up to especially in the car scenes.

Last note: I so appreciated the big dick move of dropping the credits 40 minutes in, after SOOO much has already happened. It’s always so refreshing to see a filmmaker with such confidence and skill. Can’t wait to revisit this on streaming when I have another spare 3 hours hahahahah.

hzmbs4e,"[SPOILER ALERT]

I watched it a couple times, most recently at home where I had time to stop it and discuss it with my partner (who happens to be Japanese). I also read the short story. There are many interesting parallels, symmetries, and symbolic relationships hiding in plain sight.

It seems to me that Tatatsuki is symbolic of an emotional part of Kafuku that Kafuku has repressed in himself. Note that while Kafuku controls his own anger to the point of total suppression, Tatatsuki is completely unable to control his temper, to the point where he kills another man for simply taking pictures of him.  After Tatatsuki's final speech to Kafuku in the car, there is a shot of Tatatsuki receding into the distance as Kafuku's car drives away. I think it is symbolic of Kafuku finally coming to the realization that he must look inside himself (as Tatatsuki advised him to do) and face his own anger.

After that, we only see Tatatsuki one more time -- when he is arrested after he plays the shooting scene in Uncle Vanya -- and then Kafuku and Misaki drive to Hokkaido, where they finally allow their trauma and anger to come to the surface.  Once they acknowledge their trauma, they can move on.  Kafuku is able to play Uncle Vanya again, and Misaki is able to move on with her life (which apparently involves moving to Korea and getting a dog).

Note that while Oto's disembodied voice reads Sonya's part in the car, it is the voiceless Yoon-a who plays Sonya in the play.  There is a very powerful dialectical relationship between words and emotions throughout the entire film, and this is one of the central themes, I believe.  This is somewhat self-evident in Kafuku's approach to Uncle Vanya, in which he forces the actors to learn the lines first and only then allow the emotions to come out of them. And yet some of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the movie come from the only character who never uses words at all (Yoon-a obviously).

Another parallel is found between Oto and the former-lamprey girl in her story.  Oto apparently needed to confess her infidelity, just like the girl needed to confess to the security camera about killing the burglar.  Like the girl in the house who was never seen or known by Yamaga, Oto felt unseen by Kafuku, and her taking lovers into their home, where Kafuku would see them, was on some level a desire to stoke his anger -- a way to force him to acknowledge her presence in his heart. But of course he refused to do so, to the point where he could not even come home the evening she died. His subsequent anger, guilt, grief, and loss of resolution is obviously the central conflict of the film, and the arc is the sequence of events by which he finally comes to terms with all of it.

Another parallel:  Oto's story-telling moments come from a state of dissociative identity, quite possibly; not unlike the ""Sachi"" identity that emerges from Misaki's mother. Both identities are a source of comfort/bonding for Kafuku/Misaki.

And finally, there are the obvious parallels between the scenes from Uncle Vanya and the events of the film.  I don't know much about Uncle Vanya, but the scenes depicted in the film are obviously relevant.  The reference to ""fidelity is a lie"" is obviously what causes Kafuku to suffer a momentary breakdown -- the only time in the film when his emotions get the better of him, at least until the moment of resolution at the location of Misaki's house when he finally lets it all come to the surface. And the acceptance that they can never go back, but are ""doomed"" in some sense to endure this pain, just as the characters of the play are forced to endure their misery until they die and face God.

There is the stone-faced couple (particularly the woman, whose name I could not discern, but whose version of a stone face is eminently kind while bizarrely emotionless) who informs Kafuku of the rules and conditions under which he must direct the play:  These are the actors you can choose from; you must have a driver; you have two days to decide whether to cancel the play.  They are like God setting the rules by which he must live, no matter how difficult or uncomfortable this existence is.  Redemption will only come once the play is complete (or you have died and presented God with your misery, in the final lines of the play).",t68wqu
hzafkil,"I saw this a few weeks ago and it's easily the best film I've seen so far this year. It would absolutely be in the top three films of 2021.

The script is incredible. I read the short story it was based on when the anthology came out and it left little impression on me but this film manages to flesh it out so well. And it's such a wonderful acting showcase. Takatsuki's monologue in the car might be the single best piece of acting I've seen all year. I'm really glad I caught this one in a cinema where I could just sit and allow the narrative to watch over me instead of pausing and getting up to get something or check my phone like I often do at home. And I barely felt the length. I was just along for the ride. I really loved the Korean couple. The scene with the two actresses in the park is also a highlight. So moving and emotional. 

I will say that I found the cathartic scene at the house to be the only stumble for me. After being quite spare and understated, the dialogue suddenly becomes very heavy-handed in a way that I found clunky and unnecessary and the acting doesn't quite carry it off either. But outside of that, it's pretty much perfect.",t68wqu

hza81rn,"I enjoyed it but I am a little disappointed that I didn't feel anything during that climactic snow scene. Ultimately the  three hour runtime doesn't feel earned. The payoff is quite lackluster

They could have easily cut down the first act and all the play rehearsals",t68wqu
hza8g16,"By far my favorite movie of 2021. It’s not for everyone, but in terms of my personal taste, it’s like Hamaguchi took notes on everything I love about East Asian slow burn dramas and condensed it into one perfect film. Yoona’s last scene on stage with Kafuku gets me every time.",t68wqu
hzc83ko,"I watched this back in December in a theater, very grateful for that. But I felt like something was missing for me at the time. Technically perfect, brilliantly acted, and yet something about it felt hollow to me at the time and I didn't connect to the characters. 

However, as my friend told me later on, apparently the part where a poor old man accidentally turned on his phone flashlight and distracted me was during the part where the younger man talks about what he loved about his departed wife, and was arguably the most emotional and personal scene of the movie. So maybe that's why it didn't connect fully on first watch. I look forward to a rewatch.",t68wqu
hzem5or,"""Drove My Car"" I'm crying. Best Picture nominated film but even the Reddit mods can't get it right.",t68wqu
hz9vnf3,"I saw it a couple weeks ago, it was my first time back in the theater since they reopened where I live. I went back to the independent cinema I always go to in my city and I was so excited to see this movie. I didn’t feel like the three hour running time was too heavy. I’m a big fan of Murakami and I felt just the same way watching this movie as when I read his novels or short stories, it captured the same atmosphere and I loved it. The cinematography was beautiful, the long driving shots were gorgeously filmed. Hidetoshi Nishijima’s performance is stunning. I loved the inclusion of multiple languages in the play, and how it flowed so nicely. It’s a beautiful story about art, and grief, and going on with your life even when it’s hard and it spoke a lot to me. One of my favorite movies of the year so far.",t68wqu
hzftmwm,"I love this movie, there was such a great use of silence in the entire movie where powerful scenes were done so subtly and the weight of each moment can be felt so well.

There were so many great genuine moments and Ryusuke Hamaguchi is a genius in making characters feel so real. The dinner chat was really comfy, the car rides were great and I love the small moments of progression like Kafuku slowly warms up to the driver seen from him moving seats eventually as well as how he slowly reveals more and more about the past.

My favourite scene has to be how powerful the scene after the actor leaves the car in the big reveal. Usually, there would be some big breakdown or outburst but there was this understanding between Misaki and Kafuku in the car - simply letting go and understanding they both have gone through a lot in the past.

Hidetoshi Nishijima deserves a best actor nod, he sold his whole character so well as well as a lot of the other cast members.

After watching this movie, I watched Hamaguchi's other film, Asako I and II and that was was pretty decent as well and I can sense his recurring theme of really knowing how to make genuine character interactions.",t68wqu
hzttasr,"Cried buckets with this film. The layers of intertextuality were something to behold, and it’s such a masterstroke how much of Waiting for Godot’s Estragon and his pronouncement of “I will go on” gets alluded to in Sonia’s final speech, and how all of that is framed in sign language, as if to say that the most important things, that of living with the full weight of one’s history, cannot be said but only shown/lived. The casting choice for the mute girl was absolutely fantastic.",t68wqu
hzaa6ia,"Really great film. I feel like a lot of people nowadays are so down on the idea of trauma and think they need to ""get over it"" to move on. To ignore that it happened to be strong. I like that this movie shows that you have to acknowledge and accept that those things will be part of you forever and you have to use those experiences in order to truly move on.",t68wqu
hza3fgt,"Going to be a bit against the early grain here it seems in that I thought the movie was simply good not great. The payoffs at the end didn't merit the 3 hour run time to me, where the opening 40 minutes and the auditions felt unnecessary. The entire first act pre credits could be trimmed and not significantly alter the movie. In fact the latter scenes between yusake, Koji, and Misaki might've been more powerful doubling as reveals. The auditions didn't serve much of a purpose to me for how long they went on. The latter driving sce e between Koji and Yusuke didn't seem to mesh with Koji's character at that point especially with what he had just done right before it. It took me out of the movie a bit feeling much more forced than the rest of the story. 

That said, the film features maybe the most natural feeling driving scenes I've ever watched and what a perfect car to pick for the movie. There's plenty of great performances but to me if you're going to hit that 3 hour mark as a movie the delivery needs to be incredible and this didn't reach that level.",t68wqu
hzhecmj,I love how the epilogues in both this film and The Worst Person in The World indicate months passing by having people wear masks.,t68wqu
hz9tnf3,"Probably the best film of last year IMO. Better than The Power of the Dog but only by a hair. 

It's such a nuanced take on grief and loss. Plus the human connection that brings us together, be it positive or negative. 

I wasn't sure what this movie was going to be going into it, and was so happy it wasn't a story about Yusuke and Misaki getting together. Watching their friendship evolve over this movie was wonderful and also got a few tears out of me, especially at the end. 

I like that in the end it is a very subtle take on Oto's infidelity, where she did love him but wasn't getting what she needed out of him and sought it elsewhere. It would be so easy to make her the villain and this movie has no true villain not even Takatsuki (well sort of). 

I definitely want to read the original story and Norwegian Wood after this, which a lot of BookTubers I follow always recommend. 

I'm wondering if anyone feels this way or if I'm alone. Did Takatsuki force himself on Oto and she just went with it? Based on what we learn about him and what he does in the story, I feel like its possible but I'm not sure. I'm interested if anyone else feels this way.",t68wqu
hziuzfn,"I saw this movie last month when it started making the rounds in small theaters. While I enjoyed the movie, the number of arthouse tropes was just so numerous.

hzwig7t,"A very stunning and beautiful movie. Grief is something that can consume us and I could definitely relate to Kafufu and Watari thinking so much about the ""what if's"" with my father. He passed from cancer and I can't help but think about what I should've done to make better use of the time he was alive and well and the months and then days leading up to his death. It took my lows to a new low and made me less risk-averse. The ending of Drive My Car was subtle and beautiful. Long movie well worth the full ride.",t68wqu
hzcgt5w,One of 2021's most heartbreaking and downright extraordinary films.

i1qa2oh,"I'm astounded by and grateful for how much this movie *feels* like reading Murakami. Maybe that would seem like a given--for a film adaptation to feel like its book--but it's not always the case, and I loved the sensation of Murakami's words reading themselves to me in this new medium. I could watch 20 more movies like this.

It's been said, but Park Yoo-Rim, the actress who uses Korean sign language, is phenomenal. I love that the film was silent during her signed speech just as it was when other actors were speaking with their voices. I'm struggling to find information about Park--Is she deaf? Does she normally sign?--but I have this sense of like, *this* is how you do representation. This movie didn't have to be overtly about people who use sign language (I'm looking at you, Disney). It didn't have to talk about how shitty and offensive hearing people are, or how crap society is. It just showcased how powerfully this particular actress can communicate, and with sign language--and everyone is stunned without needing to be told to be stunned. I fully expect to see more signing actors in the media. I liked The Shape of Water for this, too, but Drive My Car does it even better.",t68wqu

hzxkz4f,"Saw this in a theater shortly after new years knowing almost nothing about it.

Excellent film. Definitely a demonstration of how pacing is different than sheer length. The film is just how long it needs to tell it's story. The opening credits dropping 40 minutes in feels natural because that's just how long that prologue takes.

The only problem I got is with the script: did it really needed to be 3h long? Sure, it moves rather efficiently and even when ""nothing"" happens... I couldn't help but wonder: could that first act, the whole set up of him walking on his wife having sex with the actor, him having that car accident and the subsequent death and ceremony of his wife...

It was an eye opening and also honestly a bizarre experience.

The closing scene where she signs and conveys those words that he needed the most, was absolutely heartbreaking. The way she communicated her sign language over him felt so intimate and so nurturing that I lost it.

Maybe I’m used to slower paced movies and TV shows but each and every part of the movie felt so human and so authentic. It’s like they captured a real human experience and conveyed it raw without the extravagance that Hollywood tends to add.

i1nu31z,"I liked the film. Very quiet and meditative. Despite being 3 hours long, I was lulled in by its deliberate rhythm and pacing. Found the connection between Yūsuke and Misaki to be very touching, especially in their parallels. One image that will stay with me is them driving at night with their lit cigarettes hanging out from the sunroof. I was also very curious about the story Oto told about the girl who was a lamprey in a previous life. It's said that Oto does not remember these things until Yūsuke reminds her again in the morning. I wonder if they were actual memories from her childhood or what they actually symbolize. I also wonder if that was in any way tied to the cerebral hemorrhaging. Even when Kōji recounts the rest of the story, it still does not have a proper ending. I guess it must represent the same confession that Oto was unable to tell him on the day she died.

I'm curious about the coda where Misaki is still driving the red Saab with a dog that looks a lot like the one we see at the couple's house during dinner. Are we to infer that Yūsuke gifted the car to her to start her own life, or was she possibly going grocery shopping for him? We never find out about whether the glaucoma ultimately took away his ability to drive. I'm just curious how other people interpreted that epilogue, since I think the high point during Uncle Vanya was the better way to end the film.",t68wqu

 My idea is that the dude who slept with the lead’s wife in the movie killed his wife or aided in it. 

Several times throughout the movie he is shown to be aggressive, violent, and jealous—maybe even possessive. 

Once during auditioning with the costar, once in the bar going up to someone who took a picture and last in chasing after someone taking a picture, but this time he beats him to death. 

Additionally, he seemed very jealous that the lead got to spend much time with her/knew her well and that maybe Oto wouldn’t leave him. 

So I wonder if Oto had called him over for the talk with her husband Kafuku and maybe  he got violent about the idea maybe pushing her down or something causing the hemorrhage. 

Otherwise, I’m very confused on why he would be shown to be so violent. Or why those details were dropped throughout the movie, for nothing other to further tarnish the character’s image. 

I wish I could understand Japanese because maybe the translator also added to my confusion as well.

i37j90f,"There were scenes that closely resembles one of the plots in Honey & Clover. This is when Misaki and Yūsuke went to Hokkaido to visit Misaki's old house.

In Honey and Clover, Mayama and Rika, both dealing with their own grief, visit's Rika's old house in Sapporo, crushed by the weight of the snow. She recalls of sweet and bitter memories, how in this barren lands, her only companion growing up was her dog Shiro. She proceeded to dig a hole in the snow and placed biscuits and poured milk, and covered the hole again, as a respect to Shiro.

In Drive My Car, both characters were dealing with grief, visits an old house in snowy Hokkaido, also destroyed by a landslide (how convenient). While I was watching the beginning of that scene, I was already thinking how similar it was to Honey and Clover. The moment Misaki digged a hole to plant her cigarette, I was shocked. And it was odd that in the last scene of the movie, Misaki has a dog that is the exact breed as Rika's Shiro.

i27i3gg,"I liked it up until a certain point when the plot became corny. The part where the driver starts unloading about ""Sachi"" and how she was her ""only friend"" was what lost me. At that point, any sense of nuance or restraint went completely out the window and it just became a heavy-handed melodrama that was layered on too thick. It felt like the plot of an anime written for teenagers, the characterization of the driver herself felt like an anime stereotype - brooding, aloof, damaged girl that shows zero emotion until the very end. Multiple personality disorder is actually very rare, but it is overused as a cliched plot device.

Visually though, I thought the film was absolutely gorgeous. The framing, the colors, the lighting, everything was a feast for the eyes.

It's worth a watch, but definitely did not need to be 3 hours long. The dialogue was also very exposition-y, like the very literal title, everything gets spelled out. Little is left to imagination as the characters lay out all their thoughts/emotions and backstories on the table. The director seems to believe that ""more is more"".",t68wqu

>!The young actor who gets arrested for beating and killing the guy who snapped pictures of him, later we hear the news talking about his arrest, and they say that he was caught having sex with a minor? Did I hear/read that right? Was it established earlier on, or was it only mentioned once during that news broadcast? I'm wondering what we're supposed to take from that detail.!<",t68wqu
i2wrugy,"I kept thinking his glaucoma would return to screw him up later in the plot, but there were many scenes where he kept taking his eyedrops. As others have said here, Kafuku holds it together very well other than a few slips (car accident, going off stage), which was a nice change from other films that show someone fall apart much more easily.

Kafuku's relationship with Takatsuki was the most interesting to me. I wish I could care about his relationship with the driver, but it didn't land for me. I know this word is being overused here but ""heavy handed"" is all I can say about the visit to the driver's home scene, which dragged out. Yoon-a's final performance in the final play didn't land for me in the way it did in the first two scenes with her.",t68wqu

i6j41ld,"I believe the scene with Takatsuki in the car also quietly revealed that Takatsuki was perhaps the last person to talk to Oto. The story that Oto revealed was chronological. It was the night prior that she recounted only the events leading up to hearing the new intruder. The morning of Oto’s death, Kafuku was looking up lampreys, did not recount the story to Oto, and, I believe she suggested they sit down to talk only because Kafuku was short with her and “didn’t remember” the story. Oto having a bag of groceries further suggests she left the apartment and, perhaps, saw Takatsuki, thereby completing the chronological story. There’s a moment in the car we’re Kafuku touches his face in pure grief, because in addition to Takatsuki having had the final piece to the story, he had a final piece to the story that could have only been told to him the day of Oto’s death. He was not even the last person to talk to her.

The deliberate pace of it gives you plenty of time to think about what's going on underneath the surface (which is where 99% of this movie really happens).  It's a stark contrast to so many modern films and TV shows, with their quick cuts and densely action-packed scenes that seem necessary to capture our dwindling attention spans in this day and age.

When I was a teacher, I had to take the time to write out all the equations with chalk on a blackboard.  For a while, I tried using pre-written transparencies to display the equations because I figured it was faster and more efficient, but the students had a harder time with that; they didn't like it. A more experienced teacher explained to me that it was vital for the students to have that time while I was writing on the blackboard to digest and think about the meaning of what I was putting up. Like the equations on a blackboard, this movie is so dense and rich with meaning that it requires that extra time to reflect, and the pacing allows you to do that.",t68wqu

Characters are stuck in a groove that determines what happens. Additionally, many of the driving scenes focused on tunnels--both entering the tunnels and, importantly, exiting the tunnel. When you're in a tunnel, you have no control. Your surroundings determine where you will go. But each time they exited the tunnels there was a dramatic transition--and they looked back at the tunnel from which they emerged. You cannot change the past, but now you're out of the tunnel (in the present). What are you going to do?",t68wqu
hztug7p,"Wonderful analysis. I’ll add too on your point regarding the lampray girl and her confessing to the security camera - it was also a security camera that caught Tatatsuki killing the photo guy, which itself also serves as some kind of parallel to Oto’s story since Tatatsuki was very concerned about his public image and tried to rehabilitate it despite his inclinations, and the guy taking his photos were probably for him “burglarizing” his identity which he was trying so hard to rehabilitate.",t68wqu

i0qpe40,"One thing I would say about the heavy handed-ness....Remember that the feelings Yusuke has towards his wife are extremely complex.  As far I can remember, his emotions all together: he is loving her and missing her prescense as anyone does when they loose a love one + he is dealing with the guilt that he could've saved her + he's really angry and upset with her for seeing other men and never telling him about it + the jealousy he probably feels towards the younger actor who she shared more of her final story with.    


As well, Yusuke doesn't  have any close, intimate friends with whom he feels comfortable talking about his wife with (in fact, the movie shows a journey of finding people you can, over time, be vulnerable with).   There's people that are kind to him, (I sense that he felt quite comfortable and happy with the deaf actress and her husband), but that is a lot different than what he feels towards Misake.  And so, since he had not spoken honestly about his very complex emotions for the past however many years, it comes out, as you say, heavy handed and clunky.",t68wqu

i3ayyou,I found the movie profoundly moving as a piece but didn't find any single moment that overwhelmingly moving.

I'm only basing that off of Takatsuki's behavior. We see him take liberties with Janice and then we are told he took advantage of a minor, and we never actually see who Oto was having sex with that day.",t68wqu
i0giidx,The Batman,t68wqu
hzcz41b,I don't think it had loose threads. Sorry if it reads that way. I meant it felt like there were a bunch of loose threads until the climax.,t68wqu
i2bub3l,"Painfully slow, pretentious, unemotional, bland, uninteresting, just a complete slog of a film",t68wqu
hzbnpjw,There was a non-diegetic score,t68wqu
i1md6gc,"> ical the pacing is, you can really flow with it if you allow yourself.

Not only that, but she did the surgery to improve her scar, so she was moving on also",t68wqu
i2efcv1,"Thanks.  I suppose they wanted that specific car.  I just googled it and the original story had an ""ancient yellow Saab 900 convertible"" which they changed to red in the film.  I also googled ""is left hand drive legal in Japan?"" and it looks like it's not just legal but common so the answer to my original question is ""not significant at all.""",t68wqu
i4tu8jj,"Not sure, haven’t talked to him in a while.",t68wqu
i29izzk,"Thank you. 

That's a very interesting detail in an already interesting movie.",t68wqu
i6yupol,"My impression as well. Also he was also struggling with his own demons. He was a bad person, but Oto spoke to that evil in a way that made him love her. 

It made Oto more interesting and Kafuku more devastated.",t68wqu
iel8zbk,Wallahi this comment is cursed hahahaha,t68wqu
i0eqjas,I actually really liked Burning and i unfortunately didn’t enjoy this one nearly as much.,t68wqu
hzbo9c3,"The audiobook version of *The Elephant Vanishes* is great, and the performance of “Burning” is the highlight.",t68wqu
hzf0rwk,Probably the route to go. I mean I can’t even imagine Kafka on the shore or wind up bird chronicle being adapted lmfao,t68wqu
hzc6ds0,"That's interesting. I read ""Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,' and really enjoyed it. I have the ""Men Without Women"" collection and will likely dive in later this weekend! Have you read ""Kafka on the Shore"" or ""1Q84""? I have those as well and will eventually get to them.",t68wqu
hzcycxk,"Having 3 hours to try and accomplish it, it still left me a bit cold and disconnected emotionally",t68wqu
i3jmff5,"right! holy shit i didnt even realize that he is so used to her voice from the tapes and the actress delivering it doesnt have a voice, wow holy fuck",t68wqu
i2qf3gi,"I'm reading this the day after I watched it. I totally didn't think about that, and reading that now made me tear up again. What a powerful scene.",t68wqu
hzci8dm,"Same, that scene was so excellent. I felt like the movie, even at its length, didn't earn any of the emotional moments it was trying to push, and it didn't give us enough time or development with certain characters that became important later on.",t68wqu
i0cejxi,I think if they cut it into 30–40 minute pieces it would pace perfectly fine as a 5 or 6 episode miniseries.,t68wqu
i3zv4t8,Same! I was half asleep right when she was throwing the bouquet one flower at a time. Then I kept nodding until the end given the slow pace.,t68wqu
i0qlkc9,"It wasn’t a shiba, it was a Korean jindo. They look similar! Leads me to believe she got the dog along her travels further west than Japan..",t68wqu
i2ahkm2,I did came into my personal conclusion that Yosuke died by Covid and left his car to Misaki.,t68wqu
i2355f8,"She was definitely in Korea. They spoke Korean, the car had Korean plates and she drove on the right side of the road.

I don't know the why exactly. I think the point is they both moved on. The guy was holding on the past, which was symbolized by the car. So giving it away was him moving on. And the girl moved on by continuing moving west and ended up in Korea. Maybe she was inspired by the mute Korean woman, she seemed interested in her.",t68wqu
i2a97x5,"Unless you understand Japanese or Korean you're likely to have missed the fact that she's in Korea at the end, since they don't mention it with a title card. But she's undeniably in Korea at the end. The grocery store's products are all in Korean, she speaks Korean with the cashier, her car has Korean license plates, the grocery store's sign is in Korean, she drives on the right side of the road, etc. It's blindingly obvious if you speak either Korean or Japanese that she's no longer in Japan.

As for why she picked Korea, there's a couple of possible reasons. First, it seems like she was really moved/impressed by the Korean couple and especially Lee Yoo-na, the mute Korean actress. This could have sparked the idea of moving to Korea in her. Perhaps she is searching for the kind of pure love and companionship that the Korean couple seem to share.

In addition, Korea is just kind of a natural and practical place to go if you're from Japan and want to have a fresh start in a new country. [It's the closest country](https://www.mapsofworld.com/asia/maps/map-of-japan-south-korea.jpg) both geographically and culturally to Japan (Busan, Korea is just 200 miles from Hiroshima, Japan... at their closest distance, the two countries are just \~30 miles apart). In addition, as they mention in the movie, Korean grammar is nearly identical to Japanese grammar, so it's easier for a Japanese person to learn Korean than to learn Chinese or English, which has completely opposite grammar to Korean/Japanese. There's also a fair amount of tourism between Korea and Japan... a Japanese person visiting Korea is like a British person visiting France.",t68wqu
hzvas8i,not just posh looking - I believe it's literally the same model car just in different tones of black/white/silver,t68wqu
hzt8h7q,"They were also all either white (or silvery) or black so that when the red car comes into view, it pops on screen. I thought that was an interesting use of color because if there were other cars with bright colors like yellow or green, it wouldn't work the same way.",t68wqu
i01vd8l,"Same here man, like I had to write down ideas because they were just too many to think about. I also absolutely loved how the film makes that explicit link between Sonia’s speech to Uncle Vanya and Estragon’s in Waiting for Godot when he says “I cannot go on, I must go on,” which is subtely referenced in the earliest parts of the film when Yusuke plays the character in front of Oto and an audience.",t68wqu
i2cpp4i,Sitting here reading this on the porch taking a drag of my cig to debrief after my first watch - just blown away…,t68wqu
i6z5bjh,"you can't really say that when they ended the movie with the destination though. If it's a film about the journey, show only the journey.",t68wqu
hzfgb9a,"I'm okay with this interpretation, but I do think in the original short story he's aware of multiple affairs. Also just as a character Oto really feels like a sexual being that isn't satisfied by a single partner.",t68wqu
hza7rre,"It’s implied to be Takatsuki because Kafuku mentions that relationships only last as long as the filming, so the timeline matches up. Even if it’s not him, assuming misleading timelines, the assumptions are the same, Oto has a pattern of only keeping these relationships for the duration of the filming for whatever she works on. You also have to consider that Takatsuki also specifically mentions that he’s jealous of Kafuku’s relationship because he would never be able to know Oto as well as he does. Yes he may have had a physical relationship, and you’re right that he’s physically dominant in other situations, but this seems to be the rare case where he was truly in love and wasn’t the one to decide whether anything happened or not.",t68wqu
i5gzj3v,"We actually do know it’s him! If you check on the sofa during the sex scene, you can see the same checkered coat he’s wearing when he gets introduced to Yusuke.",t68wqu
iaekmpm,Holy shit it’s been 77 days?? Time flying,t68wqu
i922d2h,"Ya, I agree. Some scenes were good, but most of it didn't move me that much.",t68wqu
iaekouq,Agree tbh.,t68wqu
hzd1gzz,"Not doubting you, but can you remind me where?",t68wqu
i2b1yfh,"I loved how subtle the reveals were in this film. Like in the beginning, the scar is revealed when she rolls down the car window for the first time, and then at the end the reveal that her scar is gone as she takes off her mask. In both cases the viewer only notices if they’re *really* paying attention.",t68wqu
i6z4qrw,"Same. It's funny because I kept comparing it to Burning while I was watching it and they are very similar thematically and stylistically (especially in the ending), yet Burning felt more captivating and mysterious whereas this one didn't feel like it had as much depth.",t68wqu
hzt8aab,Now imagine 1Q84,t68wqu
i0cecqj,"The short story version of “Wind-up Bird” could actually work OK as a movie, albeit a weird one.",t68wqu
hzcagza,"Kafka on the Shore is fantastic, 1Q84 I reserve recommending until people know they really vibe with him. It's a commitment.",t68wqu
hzdftwf,"I actually have not read either of those. 1Q84 came out after I started to feel a bit disillusioned by Murakami so I just wasn't interested in committing so much time to that chunker. My favourite Murakami novel is actually the first thing by him I ever read, *South of the Border, West of the Sun*. *After Dark* is also quite good and short. My favourite short story anthology of his is *The Elephant Vanishes*. I read Men Without Women when it came out and I thought it was all right.",t68wqu
hzck6ja,"I'm a fan of some Japanese cinema (Kore-eda is probably my favorite current director) but this movie left me feeling a bit hollow.  One commenter in another Reddit post said that all the characters seemed to speak in the same voice, which gets at the lack of character development you mention.

I couldn't find out if the deaf actress in the movie is actually deaf in real life but I found her signing to be mesmerizing overall.  She conveyed a lot of passion in how she did it.",t68wqu
hzg4ccm,"I didn't think any moment needed to be earned, or felt like it was trying to push any emotion until the last scene of the play. It doesn't pay off unless you have all those scenes before where people are being pretty detached from what is going on emotionally. The way the lines were read for the play in the beginning, were how they were acted between characters. I felt like that was the character development.",t68wqu
i2bfzii,Here I was just thinking he gave her the car as a way to move on and turn his symbol of being locked in grief into the freedom for her to start a new life.,t68wqu
i2bgaca,">	Maybe she was inspired by the mute Korean woman, she seemed interested in her.

She also got a dog after connecting with that couple’s one.",t68wqu
i4meafq,"They pushed the setting in Korea hard with the long pan of 15 Hyundais in a row.  I think they had to show she moved somewhere new, and on purpose, as opposed to how she just ended up in Hiroshima.",t68wqu
i2jc0aw,I don’t speak Japanese or Korean but realized she was in Korea when every car in the parking lot was a Hyundai and then confirmed when she drove on the right side instead of the road.,t68wqu
i0tth8q,Which is very normal in Korea.,t68wqu
i1s5ss7,Definitely noticed all the Hyundai logos.  Maybe because I've been car shopping.,t68wqu

hzd3jdv,The opening credits and the cigarettes through the sun roof are two times when the score comes in. There’s a few others I can’t remember,t68wqu
hzchsrk,"They both certainly have some weird sex in them. But yeah i agree with you, i try to steer people off of starting with either of those. I think 1Q84 has more peaceful mundane sections which is always a draw.",t68wqu
hzsv1ex,"What do you mean by ""characters seemed to speak in the same voice""",t68wqu
i18fhzf,"Yoon-a was hearing in the movie. I'm pretty sure she was nonverbal. Not sure if it was selective or not. The actress, Park Yoo Rim, doesn't seem to be deaf.",t68wqu
i20fy4m,Yup. it doesn't help that I don't find their headlight style very cool,t68wqu
i07j4fe,"And if we think timeline wise. That means the last person to sleep with her was Takatsuki, so he’s definitely the person Kafuku spotted and led to him delaying coming home before he discovered Oto dead.",t68wqu

hzu9xvq,"Well I'm quoting a commenter talking about the movie, but I took it to mean that there wasn't much difference between the characters.  Like when young studboy actor is sitting in the car talking to the main character, he thinks and talks the same way as the main character, supposedly with such deep insight into what made the wife the way she was.  The characters seemed in a way all like manifestations of the screenwriter's mind and not truly unique individuals.",t68wqu
i18fr5c,Thanks - and it didn’t occur to me she could hear.  I guess I just assumed but feel like I should have picked up on that.,t68wqu
hzcj11k,"No, yeah, its par for the course, but i'd say those two have some of the most questionable.",t68wqu
hzxiiim,I get what you're saying and it's a Murakami thing. I'm not sure if you read his works but almost all his characters are unusually deep in one way or another. I kind of like that about his books.,t68wqu
i0o8p7e,"I would also add that a lot of creative/artistic types DO talk like this.  But there's subtle differences between them.  For example, think about how, after the lengthy back and forth about  Oto's story that you mention,  Misaki says how she sensed that the younger one was telling the truth (or atleast  he believed he was).  One of the big differences within these creative/artistic types (in their talking) is that some, especially the younger ones, talk gibberish out their ass, while others, often the older, speak with sincerity.   This also plays into the theme of communication, one of the larger themes in the movie.",t68wqu
i18muz0,"It was one line her husband said during the audition, easy to miss",t68wqu
hzz5h38,"No, I haven't any of his works.  I suppose that can make for some interesting concepts and discussions though it's not necessarily very realistic.  For this movie, I don't think it was my biggest issue necessarily but it was a good observation about characterization.",t68wqu
i0ombkv,"I appreciate your insight. Doesn’t make me like the movie any more but it is interesting.  I had a passing thought while watching it about how the filmmakers chose an actor/director as their central protagonist.  It reminds me how Hollywood loves to make movies about Hollywood, which is a trend that does nothing for me.  I guess it’s writing what you know, but it could make it harder for others to relate to.",t68wqu
iw3ahf2,8 months late but I just watched this movie. Murakami writes in Magical Realism. His stories are meant to have an air of mysticism and it being not-quite-realistic.,t68wqu
i0ql2np,"Yes!  I think thats a really interesting choice as well, and again lets us think about communication and also speaks on the power of art.   It also gives us a real insight into living with grief.  As someone who lost  two close loved ones as an adolescent, grief is something you really do live along side.  Notice how, while going through these large emotional challenges that the movies shows us, Yusuke is able to direct and star in a massive theatre production.  And how, in all the scenes of rehearsal, he comes across as extremely professional.  There were times where I thought he was going to yell or loose his temper, but he's always speaking and behaving calmly (even though we feel there is much more beneath the surface), never aggressively arguing or being combative with the actors, even when there are disagreements.

I agree, the hollywood about hollywood i find boring af.  But for me, another thing Drive My Car uses this meta-ness of the story for is to reinforce the ambiguity involved in communication; that is, we never really know how to differentiate between someone being honest and someone  acting.",t68wqu
