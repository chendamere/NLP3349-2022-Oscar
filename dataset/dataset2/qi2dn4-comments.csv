higq871,"Saw this tonight and enjoyed it quite a bit. It does have its share of flaws (mostly a bit repetitive in parts, and some things didn't get a satisfying payoff) but overall it was good. In particular the visuals were great. It will be interesting to see some behind the scenes info on how much of the mirror shots and swaps were CGI, cuts, or clever camerawork and orchestration.

I really wanted something at the end like a newspaper or radio style voiceover mentioning how many bodies were found in the end. And it seemed like there was going to be more with the roommate.

hiibu83,"Edgar Wright gave the floor to Diana Rigg and Terence Stamp to go wild and I respect it. I enjoyed the twist with Sandy very much.

No one moves the camera like Edgar Wright. The first dance sequence with Jack & Sandy was worth the price of admission alone. Style for days right there.

Good ass movie with good ass characters in a good ass setting with good ass photography and good ass music.

Good ass /10.",qi2dn4
hipe7yl,"I thought it was good up until the last 20 minutes or so when Sandy decided to stab Ellie’s friend and then like 5 mins later says “save him!” Like what???

hiplg40,"While everyone here is giving visual credit to Edger I want to give shoutout to the cinematography. Chung-hoon Chung. (He shot  films like The Handmaiden, and Oldboy, with his prominent English language films being ‘It chapter 1” and hotel Artemis.)

Absolutely gorgeous lighting, camera movements and I really loved how the “visions” were shot anamorphic while the normal state of the world was spherical.",qi2dn4
higoxg3,"RIP Diana Rigg, she was damn phenomenal as the lady you knew never to fuck with. Glad her last role was exactly that.",qi2dn4
hiqmcy8,"Just saw it tonight. When Sandy was revealed I thought it was meant to be a social commentary about abuse and how trauma can heavily impact a person and exploring the lengths someone might go to “escape” their traumatic past.

Honestly, I thought the reveal was alright until the scene where ellie was getting chased up the stairs with a knife, that was goofy.",qi2dn4
hj54r80,"Man this movie had such potential. It starts off so great, this eerie, supernatural thriller, connecting these two young girls through time, sharing loss and fear and heartache. It could have been a great story, sad and intimate detailing the horrific things Sandy went through ending in tragedy. Showing how her experiences of Soho tangle/mirror Ellie's own. It was brilliantly shot, looked amazing, sounded great, awesome cast.

But christ did it go wrong in the 2nd half. Major Spoilers.

>!Why did the cop get so super defensive when Ellie questions him on Sandy's murder. He spent that time in the 60s supporting these women and helping them. But any interaction with Ellie he acted like a massive creep totally out of character. How the hell did she not know his name after all this time? Purely to mislead the audience it made no sense.!<

>!What was up with her class mates. These people don't actually exist. Why spend so much time focusing on little insignificant details, like hinting that dink had been spiked for no reason at all. Purely to mislead the audience it made no sense.!<

>!Why did Ellie see Sandy had been murdered but all the other visions where accurate as to what had actually happened. It was painfully obvious Sandy was the landlord, with a cheap trick showing Sandy dead to try and throw us off. Purely to mislead the audience it made no sense.!<

>!Are we supposed to believe that 60s Sandy killed all these men, hid them all in the floor boards and was never discovered? Even though she'd been seen with them time and time again at all these events. No absolute nonsense. I mean.. the smell alone.. yikes.!<

>!Why did the poison not do anything? Like what was the point? Why tell her?!<

>!Why turn Sandy into the villain.!<

>!Why are the ghosts chasing her all over town then shown to be struggling to break from their burial chambers in the bedroom later on.!<

>!Where was she getting all her money?!<

>!Why was the love interest such a massive massive weirdo. Why did he hang around after that traumatic scene when she brings him back. Any sane person would have noped the fuck out of there. She shows no interest in him at all the entire movie until she's scared using him for company. Next thing we know they're madly in love. !<

The film showed so much promise in the first act, and up until the point where she performs as a dancer, and we see what the industry is really like, I was absolutely enthralled, I could totally understand the hell these women were put through. After that it turned into any other horror/ghost, slightly slasher esque movie, and not a very good one.",qi2dn4

hiohz0x,"I read on wiki that they had additional shooting in 2020 after wrapping up production in 2019. Perhaps, they shoout a different finale or made some plot corrections? There is something weird about the plot construction of this movie. It's not the editing, it's the screenplay that feels shattered, in a way. I don't know, it did feel to me like there were two different screenplays fighting each other after the first act was over.",qi2dn4
hiudi5d,"Ok guys, wtf was the hickey that Ellie got after her first vision? I thought it was some implication that she actually was transporting in time and taking on like an alter ego, which is obviously not what was going on, but then it is never brought up again???",qi2dn4

higr607,"Not gonna lie, I saw the ""For Diana"" at the beginning and immediately thought of Rigg but it took me half the movie to realize the landlady was Diana Rigg",qi2dn4
hihwizf,"What really did for me was how the movie managed to show the dark side of nostalgia. 

Most people who are into the 60's, 70's and 80's say it was better back then based on film, music, fashion and affection while completely ignoring the not so great aspects of that time and place. At first Eloise was starstruck by how glamorous everything seemed to be in 60's London and wished she herself could live there, until she is confronted by the worst aspects of that society. 

Last decade in media was really nostalgia heavy (especially for the 80's) and it's refreshing to se a new and more realistic take on it.",qi2dn4
hiq747t,"Aesthetics of the film were off the charts: lighting, music, editing, everything. Acting was amazing from both leads and Matt Smith. 

Felt like Wright and Cairns didn’t know what their message was by the end though. Or that they were trying to juggle multiple themes and couldn’t stick all the landings. The criticism on how we fetishize the past was great. 

But the film spent the first two acts highlighting the plights that women faced in the 1960s and the struggles within an abusive relationship. And then cheapened the strongest character’s arc by turning her into a serial killer. In a different movie with a different first two acts, maybe that plot would have worked. But this felt like using deftly written social commentary for shock value. I guess the horror aspect of the film would’t have worked without this twist but I would have been equally interested in a mystery about Sandy’s murder.",qi2dn4
higwy44,"I am likely in the minority here but: I was definitely vibing with the first 30-40 minutes of the movie. I loved the idea of a student in modern times watching a past love story unfold and simultaneously having those visions inspire her fashion work. I knew the horror side would come into play, but I just wasn’t feeling the vibe that the movie switched to. I definitely liked the movie overall, but I was much higher on the first half than I was for the latter half.",qi2dn4
higodls,"Diana Rigg was in this much more than I was expecting. We are so lucky to have her give this great final performance. 

I, too, can relate to wanting to just listen to The Kinks in the middle of a crowd.",qi2dn4
higyis6,"My mind is a jumbled mess and my thoughts are too conflicting to form anything totally coherent. For now, I'll just say that it looked incredible and I think Thomasin McKenzie has a future brighter than that fucking French Bistro sign. Most unique Wright film to date - for good and bad reasons.",qi2dn4
hijr4qc,"Edgar Wright always like to put a lot of foreshadowing in his movies and it’s fun to see he even managed to do that in this movie with such a twist ending. When Ellie first moves in to the apartment Sandie warns her about the smell and blames it on the Bistro, but it’s actually from the bodies in the walls. There’s also the fun foreshadow of Jacosta giving her a drink and then later Sandie poisoning her.",qi2dn4
hipvm7c,"Ellie's final scene - her happy ending - was too much.  I was half expecting it to be a dream, revealing her to be imagining this fantasy life in an asylum.",qi2dn4
hiuqvsz,"Man, I fucking loved this movie. As someone who moved to a big, dangerous city to pursue his dreams only to have reality and mental illness pick it apart, this movie spoke to me on a pretty personal level. Just hearing lines like ""No one feels like you've let them down"" from her supportive grandmother rang so true with my own experience.

Wrapping those themes up into an Edgar Wright directed tribute to giallo and British murder thrillers was icing on the cake.",qi2dn4
hih9ie4,That building must smelled like death.,qi2dn4
hiqbxkl,"I saw it last night and honestly, the third act was a complete illogical mess which took me out of the film entirely. I kept saying ""WTF NO"" at my theater screen.

I wanted to love this movie so, so badly, and there was SO much to love about it: gorgeous cinematography, great acting, Lynchian set design, killer costumes....but writing-wise, it was so uneven.

I think my main issue was the dialogue. It was so flat. The characters were pretty one-dimensional, too, and there wasn't a lot of room for nuance or subtly (the stereotypical mean girl Jocasta had promise of being so interesting/more complex, but that went absolutely nowhere even though I felt like it was building to something, not even really her as a foil to Ellie. Nope. She was just paper thin jealous and comically nasty, something I hate in movies). And the final Big Bad Villain Twist Reveal made me roll my eyes.

That said, loved the themes and visuals and where it was trying to go.",qi2dn4
hjdakca,[deleted],qi2dn4
higob2a,"Is it weird that the horror aspects of this movie worked the least for me. Edgar Wright is so inventive and original with pretty much every thing he does, but there were several parts in this movie where it was just like ""here's some ghosts I guess"". I liked it quite a bit overall and it was really nice to see Diana Rigg poisoning people one last time, but I don't think it quite lived up to the hype for me. Maybe I just overhyped myself, which to be fair, can happen when you're waiting for a movie for like 2 years.",qi2dn4
hih0etz,"I was thinking back to any hints that the land lady was actually Anya Taylor Joy, and I just thought of one - she said she could never sell the place because she had too many memories there.

I don’t know if she was lying and just covering for the bodies, or if she was just psychopathic. Well, clearly she was psychopathic, just the extent is unknown.",qi2dn4
higwt8g,Is it worth watching in theaters friends? EDIT: I was entertained,qi2dn4
higr7wo,"I’m trying to figure out how I feel about this one. Visually it was stunning, and as always with Edgar Wright, very stylish. Acting was great and by all technical standards I have no complaints. But I feel like they kind of lost me in the third act, which somehow felt rushed. As soon as the “horror” elements began, it seemed a little unfocused. By the end, I wasn’t sure if they wanted you to root for Sandy or hate her. 

Not Wright’s best, but overall an enjoyable film. The first 30-45 minutes had me hooked, but not sure they stuck the landing.",qi2dn4
hiksr87,"Thought this was really well made with quite a few nice visuals thrown in, especially on the first dream night with the body switching, but overall I wasn't feeling much during the movie itself. 

Didn't think any of the characters were all that interesting or developed enough and there really isn't a story until the murder that takes place halfway through the movie. Throw in how repetitive much of the 2nd half felt and how much time was dedicated to the jumbo-sized red herring and it made for a pretty lackluster viewing for me.

Also, did anyone else think that the reveal of >!Sandi actually stabbing Jack instead of the other way around!< was poorly executed? Until that point I don't remember there being any indication that what we or Eloise were seeing was inaccurate in any way, so I felt that was a bit lame",qi2dn4
hioazeu,"Thoroughly enjoyed it. It ended up having a lot in common with Baby Driver where there’s a surface-level “oh this is all there is to the story?”, which is a tiny bit disappointing. I feel like Simon Pegg needs to always be on an Edgar Wright script (not because “oh he should only do comedies”, this movie was killer) just because he seems to provide the roundness to a script that’s been missing.

I do feel like nobody involved knows how college kids talk though.

But holy fuck is the filmmaking there or what?",qi2dn4
hitfbck,"The dance between Jack, Sande and Ellie was awsome, and I believe it was done in one take.",qi2dn4
hj99asj,"A clear case of style over substance. On a technical level it's masterfully crafted but as a film it's pretty bang average. The first two thirds are enjoyable but the film stumbles massively in the third act.

Wright, once again, displays immense talent behind the camera... the film is a visual treat, but surprisingly the script disappoints. Thematically the film falls flat. The twist is pretty sloppy and is both paradoxically predictable while not making sense narratively or thematically.

Overall, *Last Night in Soho* is a bit a disappointment. It's not a bad movie, but it's also not one that lives up to the level of Wright's talent and flair.",qi2dn4

higsyjw,"Not the greatest movie ever, but still a solid flick. Soundtrack was great. Loved how it started out as ‘I can’t wait til she gets back to the 60s!’ then gradually became ‘Girl don’t go back to the 60s!’
>!One too many spooky-faced-men scenes for me… could’ve done without the library scene!<",qi2dn4
hij30ar,"Saw this for free earlier in the week. Kind of an odd beast. I liked it but didn't love it. I just want to say that for all it's drawbacks, I think it's an extremely well put together movie and I do t think that should be taken for granted.

I thought the movie was a little blunt and obviousin it's themes especially early on Like yes, men are creeps etc.

When the horror elements kick in, I don't know if it's just the overt stylization or something specific with the designs but I always felt a little distanced from the proceedings. Hard to describe.

There are some beats with the spirits at the end that are a little odd, attempting them to make the a bit sympathetic though to be fair, the character rejects this. Plays like Edgar Wright's Scooby Doo on Zombie Island

Edgar Wright had been accused of being unable to write women. I think it's more accurate to say he can't write love interests. John is a non entity outside of being supportive of the lead characters immediate needs. A particular scene with him seems wildly miscalculated and tone deaf.",qi2dn4
hijbxht,"The people complaining about Ellie facing no consequences for almost stabbing her roommate are approaching CinemaSins territory. Movies can't stop to cover every single mundane event. I didn't need a scene in there telling me that she was absolved or faced some consequences for me to understand the rest of the movie. 

It doesn't take a lot for me to imagine a situation where she was given a slap on the wrist due to her circumstances seeing as that night her land lady attempted to kill her. Or even faced some type of temporary probation. 

I don't need that scene. Having that scene in there to placate the nitpickers would just bog down the film.",qi2dn4
hih3kff,"One of my biggest pleasant surprises about the film is how much of it was carried by Thomasin McKenzie. Based on the trailers and my assumptions, I thought it was going to be a two hander at the very least or a movie that would be passed to the very capable hands of Anya Taylor Joy in the middle. 

Not that either of those things would bad, but this felt like a star making role for McKenzie who I feel is one of the greatest young actresses working today. She was my standout in JoJo Rabbit despite ScarJo and Rockwell getting most of the praise and I think she held her own with grace in Leave No Trace despite most of the “big acting” being left to Ben Foster. 

She’s extremely talented and has this almost otherworldly quality. There’s something really unique about her vocal quality that gives life to these characters. My only hope is that she keeps picking interesting projects like this and JoJo Rabbit and doesn’t start Oscar hunting like Saoirse Ronan, who she reminds me of.",qi2dn4
hijd311,"I wish they'd lent into the mental illness aspect more. Have her be more unsure whether the visions are real or not. They kinda had the unreliable narrator aspect when she thought she saw Sandy getting stabbed so I don't see why they couldn't've gone a bit more surreal and unreliable. Have the ghosts blend into real life, have some elements of the real world (like the bitchy roommate and the horrible cop) be partial paranoid delusions.

The movie kinda lumped the audience with a ""Don't forget you're a psychic Ellie"" *wink at audience* within the first five minutes.",qi2dn4
hiqdcsb,"SPOILER (kinda):

That jump scare with the alarm clock was the best jump scare I’ve seen in a while. People audibly screamed in my theater and I jumped so far back in my seat - it was brilliant",qi2dn4
higqa2d,"I enjoyed the movie except for the climax, which I found to be off. My main gripe was it seemed strange for not one but two people to start monologuing in front of Ellie about their past in the span of like 10 minutes",qi2dn4
higshx6,"I thought it was kind of ok. I found myself not really caring about what was going on once the third act started. The repetitiveness made chunks of the movie a chore to get through. It seemed like Wright couldn't get out of his own way.

Visually impressive, though.",qi2dn4
him14v2,"Did anyone else get the vibe that the last few minutes was another dream?   She passes out, then mean literally everything got tied up with a nice little bow.  

-She accomplishes her dreams that she came to London for (nice little reverse mirror of what happened to Sandie). 


-Her grandma was present and her friend who was gut stabbed and inhaled a ton of smoke was there with her congratulating her. 

-Her shithead roomie was a nobody worker in Elle's successful fashion show and her buddies were worshipping her instead...so brave.  

-Her mom was reappeared for the first time in London (literally only smiling and looking exactly the same as she did in that photo...same clothes and everything...what's up with that?) 

-When we see Sandie again, she does the same thing she did in Elle's first vision/dream with the little mirror finger poke.   

Also did anyone else notice all the mentions of hell, and Alex being in hell, and Alexandra talking about the hell she was in, and the last scene we see of her in alive is literally in an inferno..",qi2dn4

When Ellie was looking through the murdered and missing persons articles, I recognized one of the dudes who showed up for a split second as one of the guys preying on Sandy.

hiiyh6r,Man this is my favourite film of the year and this comment section is bumming me out haha,qi2dn4
hil0kyf,"I think I get what edger Wright is trying to say with this film. This is a film about the horrors of nostalgia and how it consumes people.  Like Eloise I’m obsessed with the 60s, and I want to recreate the decade with my art, As it’s a form of comfort for me. But as a result, I feel like an outsider. But the fact is this nostalgia hurts my creative vision and ghosts of the past can consume me with its rose-colored glasses and at the end of the day Need to find my own indinty, and live in the presentBasically, that’s film is about. About Eloise Is a girl whose nostalgia for the past starts to consume her and ruin her life. And the only way she can truly be happy and have an identity is to murder the past and burn her nostalgia and be present. Witch is the philosophy of the  60s in a nutshell.

What further adds to this message of “The horrors of nostalgia “   is she is a fashion designer.  clothing.The Term “ retro” was coined by  Hippies in the 60s named after Retro Rockets, the mechanism that helps space ships come back down by moving the rockets by moving backward. The hippie term Retro meant ”You are living in the past and holding back progress”. Nowadays retro is a fashion  term to describe “Old fashion look and style",qi2dn4

hitur3e,"That was a great film until the last 10-15 minutes, when Edgar Wright makes a series of incredibly bad choices that craters the film. I am still angry at how shitty that ending was after how good the film had been to that point.",qi2dn4
higoeou,"Honestly thought this was just alright. Very stylish and great use of color and imagery, but overall felt very empty. The twists were fairly predictable and I wouldn't call it a particularly scary movie and it really dragged a bit. It didn't even really feel like a horror movie until almost 45 minutes in, and it wasn't funny enough to last until then. Even then, the horror aspects aren't really that scary considering it's very well established that nothing she is seeing is an immediate danger to her. 

The performances were solid and the casting was great, no doubt about that. I didn't find the characters to be super interesting and the themes were extremely blunt, but it was a nice surreal trip which you don't get every day. I'd probably give this a 6/10 and most of that to costumes, production design, and the cast.

/r/reviewsbyboner",qi2dn4
hiq4tbg,Towards the ending it became meh,qi2dn4
hix40ah,"Two things I've noticed that were in this movie that were also in Baby Driver.

1. The main protagonist doing shit that's either illegal or evidence of some psychological issues and their love interest flat out accepting or enabling that behaviour even though they don't have much reason to trust their judgement or the protagonist's true intentions.

2. The protagonist get what they want in the end despite doing shit that should really come down on their head harder or, in Soho's case, at all.

I do like the protagonist in either case having someone they can depend on in situations where they would otherwise be completely without help but Wright doesn't  give the side characters good enough reason to suspect that they might've completely misjudged these guys.",qi2dn4
hkb3vg4,"I feel like a lot of people here are going easy on this because it's directed by one of this sub's favourite directors. Thought this was an utter mess that didn't know what it wanted to say. It had the most nonsensical final act I've seen in a major Hollywood movie this year (and not in a fun way like Malignant, which also IMO actually ended up feeling closer to an Italian horror/Giallo flick than this does).

Wright should go back to making comedies with darker undertones or something completely light like Scott Pilgrim and Baby Driver. He's great at that. He has no idea how to make serious films and handle heavy themes bluntly.",qi2dn4
hj2ec84,"Really loved the first scene where she is in the mirrors. Watching. Really great editing. Also the dance between Anya Taylor Joy and Matt Smith was so good. Very pulp fiction meets la la land vibes for me. The twists were nice. I don't get the complaints. Beyond the ghosts asking for help the psychological horror elements were really good. The first part was beautifully stylish and nostalgia filled but enjoy the shift of showing the dark side of the times and it terrorizing her. I much preferred the old lady poisoning her and sneak attack gutting the boy, but her as a threat at the end with a knife was a bit unbelievable. And that ending seemed a little muddled. Like she was about to pass out yet she can easily walk back down stairs after losing blood too. Really solid film.

Eloise only found out the truth because the landlady told her the story of who she is and all the killing she did.",qi2dn4

John felt unnecessary though. Like he was only included to say ""not all men are bad""",qi2dn4

hj4vkyy,"So I think that once Sandy ditched her manager and got out of the entertainment business, she started up with a ""Don't trust the B in apartment 23"" type scam. Move young ladies into the room and ask them to follow rules they will never be able to stick to 100% of the time. Once a rule is broken, the girl and, if applicable- the girl's gentlemen visitor, get added to Sandy's collection. Hence why she would never renovate or sell the place, and why she has so many boarders just ""vanishing into the night"". Also explains why she is still concerned with the smells. Just a little knife or tea action and Voila! Two months rent and two months deposit in her pocket.

hkcs91r,"Honestly.. one of Edgar's weakest films for me.

The boyfriend character was so odd and he demonstrated inhuman levels of simping lol. 

Like he met this girl one time who barely talked to him and somehow nearly being murdered was an acceptable price to pay so he could be with this girl. Plus he honestly felt more stalkerish than most of the other men in the movie. I kept wanting Ellie to just literally yell ""fuck off"" whenever he'd randomly ""bump"" into her.

He just felt like such a drag on the plot as well as the bully character. I guess her role was to get Ellie to move out but the story could have easily skipped to that point in like one line if need be.

Something as simple as college dorms running out by still wanting to attend or something write offish like that.

Also got a bit tired of the ghosts and how Ellie rarely had direct consequences because of them (nearly stabs a girl at school among other episodes and continues to attend no problem)

I think I'm extra jaded maybe because I also saw Perfect Blue for the first time recently. Not to say they're the same movie but Perfect Blue made me fear for the main character and the creepy men around her much more while making me question what's real and what's not. Definitely that lived up to being a ""psychological thriller"".

Overall it's fine 7/10 solid film but I'm not really looking to watch it again or anything.

All the mirror shots are neat though and the dance scene where they kept switching places was really great as well. As expected from the director there's a lot of really cool shots like the blanket one.",qi2dn4

I really like that it didn’t end with Eloise killing Sandie. Both leads were stunning and perfect then Diana Rigg stole the show for me in the end.

The horror/thriller elements are pretty scattershot, by comparison.

hiqhum8,"I really enjoyed the film. I don’t have much to add that others haven’t, but one thing I’ll point out that I haven’t seen others mention is the magical realism element in this film that I really liked. Ellie’s gramma knows that she has her supernatural gift from the very beginning of the film and it’s just accepted as normal. I thought that was such a strong and effective choice to make that sets the tone for a magical and horrifying experience. It was intriguing and had me really invested in the story. Typically the main character in films with similar plots discovers their gift later and has to hide it from people. I wasn’t the biggest fan of the final act, but I highly recommend watching this in theaters.",qi2dn4

Did Sandie start killing before or after Jack's death? If before, why didn't she kill Jack sooner, since he was the one forcing her into the work? Why wait until after she'd already killed so many people?

If after, why did she continue as a prostitute, since she made it abundantly clear that she did not want to do that?",qi2dn4

Evidence: 

-her mom only appears when her grandma is around

-**She saw Sandy's past life despite Sandy being alive**

-She saw the faces of men blurred out as Sandy remembered them, not as they actually were

-She saw Sandy being murdered because Sandy thinks part of her died in that room. Sandy was not actually murdered in that room and couldn't have haunted her as a ghost. 

-Tons of people die around London and yet she never sees a ghost for those randos. 

-She never sees her mother as a someone with fatal wounds from suicide. 

-She sees Trenchcoat guy in her dreams despite him being alive for most of the movie.

hiv85gx,"I knew very little about the film going in - only that it involved a fashion student going back in time.


To this end, I loved the first half up to Sandy being a backing dancer. After that, the film felt very repetitive and cliched. I loved the idea of Ellie using “time travel” to use in her fashion - really unique idea and brought out some good and creative style in the first 40 minutes and was almost inspiring.


Then it all fell apart. The same sequence of Ellie running from “zombies” about 3 times, jumpscares every 5 minutes, no real progression - the whole policeman angle made no sense. I wanted a film that focussed on the fashion and culture of the 60s and present, instead it ended up as a forgettable horror film.


When a directors cut or deleted scenes come, in hoping for more of the first act! I reckon that was the section that was probably cut the most.",qi2dn4
hj45fin,"Oof... This movie had so much promise in the first 30 minutes, but turned into a questionable mess! The commentary mixed with the twist is an absolute disaster. Not sure what Wright was thinking. Horror and thriller elements fell flat on its face; the jumpscares were repetitive and dull.

I do know enough to know that while Diana Rigg doesn't really look like Ana Taylor-Joy, she was no less of a knockout. 

This movie was super fun and stylish and weird.  Especially for going in without expectations it was A+. 

Unlike a lot of people here I did like that the hero of the film ended up a littttttle bit dark.   Because while Sandy was a victim, she's not really someone you high five at your fashion show either? Tinge of Midsommar really.",qi2dn4

hilhdc7,"I won't say the movie blew me away, but by the end I appreciated it. I certainly didn't at first. Wright almost lulled me to a false feeling of boredom during the opening act, where Eloise goes from her farewell to her small town home, to her feeling out of place and overwhelmed by the big city, to dealing with cliched catty backstabbing women, to finally discovering the rent house. Everything is so rote and flat I was wondering if it was a movie by the same Edgar Wright who made some of my favorite movies and some of the most visually and audibly inventive films of the past twenty years (particularly Scott Pilgrim vs The World, Hot Fuzz, The World's End, and Baby Driver).

Even then there were hints during act one that the movie had more to offer. I appreciate the usage of the ""mother in the mirror"" and, especially, how it largely went unexplained. The first entry into the world of the 60s was magical, but it wasn't until the second act that the horror elements started to creep in and it was then that the director's trademark style was let loose.

In terms of the plot and the mystery and the core of the story, there are two aspects to consider, one that worked and the other that didn't. First there's the gimmick: Eloise and Sandy sharing experiences. This features some excellent camera tricks and editing magic, moves seamlessly, and has some wonderful moments to enjoy (both to look at and listen to; suckers of 60s fashion and music will love it). The other aspect, though, is the actual mystery story, which is pretty basic and while it has its fair share of twists and turns, half the reveals are pretty easily guessed, and the rest don't really pack much of a punch.

What saves the movie is the acting, directing, and pace, which starts slow (almost too slow) then slowly ramps up more and more until it's screaming by the end. It won't be regarded among Wright's best, but it's a stylish and fresh entry to the horror genre and as a fan of said genre (and of the director) I'm glad to have it.",qi2dn4
hivac15,"So I guess Ellie wasn’t a reliable narrator at all. She saw Sandie get stabbed multiple times to death and she was so sure of it that she went to the cops but it didn’t actually happen. Also, why was she so sure that Jack was the old man from the bar? Literally everyone who worked at the bar knew the guy because he went there every day and Ellie didn’t dare to ask anyone what his name was? She didn’t find out until he was hit and killed by the car? Poor guy. Same thing with Sandie, did Ellie never ask her name? I didn’t catch it. Also, her room would have REEKED if dead bodies were under the floor boards and in the walls for decades right? Anyways, it was still a great film I enjoyed it a lot but after thinking about it more and more I’m uncovering tons of things that just didn’t make sense.",qi2dn4
hivb2dp,"Liked it, but didn't love it. Visually, it has some fantastic shots and the acting is pretty solid all-around. ""The dangers of romanticizing the past"" is a theme I can appreciate and there are definitely shades of Argento and Tarantino in the mix. I don't think it really stuck the landing by the third act, but it was still quite enjoyable. 

There's also a piece of me that wonders what this film would have been like if it was more like the trailers teased...>!which is, Ellie stumbling upon Sandie's killer in modern day, who then starts coming after her. !<",qi2dn4
hiw4j3p,"I was a bit disappointed with this. Knew nothing going in, except that I love the cast and loved Baby Driver. Thought this started strong and then lost its way. Just kinda messy? A shame because there was definitely potential there. Looked incredible though and all the cast were as good as you'd expect.",qi2dn4
hiycstj,"I'm not an Edgar Wright fan, but I found this mostly enjoyable, though I'm unsure what exactly they were trying to get at with the ending. It feels like they wrote themselves into a corner and couldn't figure out how to solve it in terms of morality. On the one hand, yeah, those men deserved what Sandy dished out to them...but on the other hand, Sandy is now trying to kill Ellie to keep her secret...so Sandy is both good and bad? Should we want her to die because she's trying to kill Ellie or should we want her to survive because of the horrific trauma she went through and survived in the manner she thought best? I'm not sure what side the film comes down on, and I think Ellie's dialogue in the conversation with the ghosts at the end reflects that. She doesn't know either.

I was also a little disappointed because I figured out immediately that the landlady was Anya Taylor-Joy's character but older due to the hairstyle. When they threw in the fake out of her ""death"" in the middle of the film, I was genuinely happy because I thought I had been wrong and the film had something more clever up its sleeve, but unfortunately I was right, and it wasn't a very huge reveal to me. 

Visually, the film is stunning and Thomasin McKenzie is a fucking rockstar. I have loved every role I've seen her in and I hope she has a long, incredible career. She contrasts well with Anya Taylor-Joy as well. Anya has this very confident, in your face presence, and Thomasin has this nervous energy presence, and the two combine for something special.",qi2dn4
hizfvjn," I admit that I could recognize myself in the role of the young woman who fantasizes about past and listens to ""old music"". That makes me something in common with Éloïse Turner. On the other hand, I regret not being able to travel into the past, that would have been cool for sure.

Wright's new film offers an intriguing synopsis. Is it a psychological thriller, horror thriller or a horror movie? I'll go for horror thriller.
The first 40 minutes of the film are calm, Ellie's first visions are like the fantasies of a young teen (a beautiful young girl meets a handsome man). Step by step the atmosphere changes and the pretty dream turns into a nightmare. Ellie witnesses a murder and looks for the murderer, in 2021.
What I find brilliant is the subtlety of the clues that appear the feature film. No clue is pointless, just as nothing is rubbed in the face of the viewer. The final twist makes a lot of sense.
The film has a nice feminist touch, offering a feminine perspective on something that has too often been seen under a masculinist perspective: sexual exploitation, violence and rape.
In terms of horror, I must admit having shuddered several times. The ""ghosts"" are not in themselves extraordinary, what they represent is what I found terrifying ... especially as a woman
The use of lights, colors, cuts feed the feelings of oppression and madness.
The actors are excellent. We no longer present Taylor-Joy who has an incredible magnetic charisma. It's nice to see rising movie stars rubbing shoulders with legends (RIP Diana).

I rarely go to the movies for the prices, but I felt I really got my money's worth with Last Night in Soho. This film haunts me for hours after my viewing ... I think it will take more to fully understand all the subtleties",qi2dn4

hj58079,"I thought it was great, maybe not my favourite Wright but still very good. Camera work and sound design were especially great, and I liked all the cast even if not all the characters were hugely fleshed out; McKenzie in particular puts in an excellent performance and really is one to watch.

&#x200B;

I wish it had been a little more ambiguous on the haunting vs mental illness element, I feel the ending would have hit harder upon learning about Sandie if we hadn't been told Elly had a gift for seeing visions/ghosts beforehand. Additionally, some incongruous expressions of motivation which always grinds the gears; for example, >!Wright obviously wanted Elly and the audience to think Old Lindsey was Old Jack, but there's no in-story reason for him to be reinforcing that with his creepy ominous pronouncements about Sandie 'getting what she wanted' when he could have said 'I used to be a copper back in the day, I tried to help Sandie, etc'. If that was the truth then why wouldn't he be saying that in the first place? Likewise, the ghosts acting malevolently towards Elly when they really wanted her help doesn't make much in-story sense, but other posters have indicated this can be hand-waved a bit by the vague notions of Elly's abilities and her personal perceptions of the past.!<

hii7quq,"As a pretty big fan of Edgar Wright’s films, I gotta say I was pretty disappointed with this one. 

Before I get into my issues with it, I do wanna highlight a couple positives with it. It looked *amazing*. Cinematography and direction were on point, which isn’t surprising considering Wright is exceptionally talented. I loved the atmosphere and colors/lighting. It was super vibrant and one of the things that had stood out to me when watching the trailers, so needless to say I was pretty satisfied that it met my expectations in that department. I find myself so constantly bored with visuals in movies these days, so something with visual substance unfortunately stands out in a sea of muddiness. However, the “chase” scene in toward the end looked pretty shoddy, in my opinion. Visual effects seemed week for a movie of this caliber. 

The technical aspects of this film are about where the positives end for me. The performances are totally serviceable, not mind-blowing, but good. Nothing detracting from the film at all. But, my god, the writing is atrocious. Eloise consistently experienced the same thing over and over again once things got a little funky. The faceless figures being her exclusive source of terror for like 45mins quickly got boring. 

For a movie marketing itself as a horror/thriller, I was neither scared nor put at the edge of my seat. I felt no tension, and, shockingly, little attachment to Ellie. Aside from some interactions with some generically obnoxious and rude classmates, I never felt inclined to root or care for her. I’m not sure what when wrong, especially because I’ve always found myself loving Edgar Wright’s characters. 

The climax of the film felt so unsatisfying. The entire third act was a who’s who of predictable events and revelations. Case in point, Ellie sifting through the mail, it being basically spoon-fed to the audience that the old woman that she’s living with is Sandi and Ellie *doesn’t* realize until a couple of minutes later?! And don’t get me started on the painfully generic final scene. Felt straight out of an early-to-mid 2000s horror movie that might play on cable nowadays. 

But the biggest offense of all? HOW WAS NO ONE DRESSED UP AS AUSTIN POWERS AT THE HALLOWEEN PARTY???

I’m so frustrated and disappointed with this.",qi2dn4

hjehlr5,"I agree to many points here - I love the visuals and the overall atmosphere, but the second half brings it down a little. Overall though, quite enjoyable.

What I did quite like as someone who lived in London, and now works 10 minutes from Soho, is how geographically correct the film is, and that real locations were used. London College of Fashion is of course a real place with a main campus on Oxford Street, The Toucan is a apparently a real bar on Soho Square. Even the accommodation where Ellie lives is the real university halls (Ramsay Hall) which I immediately recognise - it does belong to UCL, although I wouldn't be surprised if there was some sharing with UAL/LCF going on. I also believe the train station scenes were filmed at Paddington, which is the station she'd arrive to from Cornwall. Likewise, Goodge Place would be a good location for someone studying at LCF. 

One thing that's not entirely realistic though is how she can afford moving out of the halls. A bedsit like this (which in reality is a studio, as it has a bathroom and kitchen), in such a prime location between Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road could be easily £1400 per month. Even assuming she somehow got a deal of a lifetime of £1000pm, with two months rent and two months deposit in advance she's looking at £4000+. She'd also probably had to pay for the entire term in halls and I doubt she'd get that money back from the university.",qi2dn4
hq6p0jj,"Ok so the ending ‘twist’ of the movie kind of bothered me because it seems like Eloise only saw that false vision to serve the narrative and come as a shock when it turned out Sandy was the murderer and not the murdered so to speak.

hil1mb7,So….Ellie can see Ghosts? But only her mum? But when she goes to London she can time travel? But only through the eyes of a particular character…that is not a ghost? This needed to be fleshed out sliiiiightly more for me as it effects the whole film.,qi2dn4
hitlsd4,"Maybe I need a couple of years to let it marinate, but it might be one of the most well directed films that did absolutely nothing for me. I think Wright's heart was in the right place and I could see what he was going for, but to me it was a huge failure of style complementing the story and pushing the narrative forward. The themes didn't feel potent, it was just kind of a bummer and when it ended I was mostly glad it was over and never wished to experience it again. A movie can be bleak in an intriguing way that keep me interested in a narrative. Like I loved Midsommar, have seen it several times, and that's 2.5 hours of a girl having a miserable time and descending into madness. But that film is an involving experience, while Last Night in Soho I just grew increasingly distant from the story and characters as it went on.

One thing Wright's other films (pre-Baby Driver, can't say I'm a huge fan of it either) do exceptionally well is have a sense of purpose, even when they're not totally enjoyable (like A World's End) we feel on an innate level why *this* needs to happen to *this* character. Last Night in Soho, for me at least, it never really felt justified by the narrative why we needed to see all shit happen to this poor girl. Because she suffers from misplaced nostalgia, has ""the gift"" and is naive? OK. By the time she had her library breakdown I wished someone did lock her up for her own good and the safety of others. And there was still half an hour of movie left. Sandie's character arc (the switch to becoming a backup dancer) was too sudden to have any sort of power. Even when punctuated with the beautiful montage with all the Johns, once again it felt like we were wallowing in well-directed misery without it leading to anything. The series of reveals at the end were... surprising, but also left us without anyone to root for. And the ambiguity didn't feel compelling, just kind of noncommittal. (And without going into spoilers, if you break it down, Eloise really didn't need to be involved in any of it.) Less said about the falsely happy ending the better.

I guess the film kind of works on a meta level of counteracting nostalgia because the idea of hanging out near the Soho Square Gardens ever again just feels depressing now, so I guess... mission accomplished, Edgar Wright? But mostly I'm just looking back on all the impeccable filmmaking and painstakingly choreographed mirrored shots and think it was a waste considering the sad dud of a story we do get. I kind of admire the mental fortitude of anyone who turns this film on for a 2nd time and sees Eloise dancing in her newspaper dress and thinks, ""Oh boy I can't wait to re-experience the cinematic pleasures that her arc will bring.""",qi2dn4

hjhmbo2,"Need some help deciphering a theme here. Jack was a pimp. I get that bit. But how realistic was his character in the 1960s? Reason I ask is, we first met Sandy when she was watching Cilla Black. Then, she meets Jack, who is a pimp. They have a fun night blah blah and the next night he takes her to another club for an audition. Then, she becomes a whore (not my term - was the term used in the 1960s to refer to working women and I think even older Sandy uses it to refer to herself).

My questions are this. In these clubs, did the pimps just sit around making all the women whores? Was it common knowledge (I notice one woman is over heard saying 'its not what I thought'). I ask because Cilla Black was a real person, and I don't believe she was ever a whore? She would never have had to start at that level just to become a singer. So, its making me think in these clubs, some women were genuine entertainers and the others were whores.  Would Jack's real life counterpart have seen Sandy as a whore all along? If the answer is yes, I am not sure how they would have gotten away with it for so long. Local women would have just known not to audition there? But then again, Sandy wasn't a local woman. Just trying to make sense of how these places would have operated.",qi2dn4

higzn24,"I didn’t watch any trailers for this movie as Edgar Wright is one of my favorite directors so I knew I was going to see it. As a result, I had no idea it was a horror so that was quite the surprise. 

The movie didn’t feel like one of his movies from the start. There was none of the energy or feel that his movies typically have. When Ellie first falls asleep in the apartment and is transported back in time is when it really feels like him and it’s absolutely wonderful. The colors, the music, the energy, and the feel of wonder as an audience member and the wonder on Ellie’s face were all perfect. And then it got darker. And darker. And darker. And then I realized this was a genre of movie that I’m just not a fan of. 

I really loved this movie up until pretty much the final act when I feel like it all sort of fell apart. It’s funny, at first when the “time travel” started I guessed that Sandy was the old woman. And then Sandy “died” so I didn’t think it anymore. And then there was a twist for the sake of having a twist with Terence Stamp. Followed by another twist that showed my initial assumption as correct. And then the male ghosts crying out for help which felt weird. And the pacing of the film felt like it was all thrown off during this. Meh.

7/10 seems to be the consensus, and that sounds about right to me. A great to good to okay movie, and unfortunately Edgar’s weakest.

EDIT: Also I just gotta say that the three leads killed it. Thomasin, Anya, and Matt were absolutely excellent together. Having only seen Matt Smith as The Doctor, I was pleasantly surprised to see that he can pull off being an absolute monster perfectly and I’d love to see more of that from him in the future.",qi2dn4
hih466t,"Great film. I completely avoided trailers so I had no idea what it was about going in, or even that it was a horror. Thomison McKenzie was fantastic. It was genuinely spooky at times which is already a lot more than most horror films have. The twists weren't shocking, but that didn't really negatively effect the movie for me.",qi2dn4
hikni8l,"I just got back from seeing this film on opening night. I thought it was fantastic and I'm pretty surprised that the reviews have been so lukewarm.

Maybe it's because I live in London...And went to university here...And have spent quite a lot of time in Soho...And I've also taken that GWR route into Paddington loads of times. So a lot of it was pretty relevant to my life experience (not the murdering and being in the 60s parts though obviously) which made me warm to it a lot.

But I think there's a lot of great stuff in there which people without the contextual familiarity can enjoy. The 60s reveal was pretty spine-tingling. There was a lot of good camerawork and creative imagery. And Edgar Wright deserves credit for stepping away from his comfort zone in terms of the overall style.

Also, the way it presents everyday harassment and the male gaze is all too rare in cinema and it deserves a lot of credit.

The soundtrack was great too, which is not surprising for an Edgar Wright film. But the team behind it did well to avoid the usual 60s clichés and going for some more obscure tracks and forgotten classics instead.

It's also soooo gratifying to see London's streets presented relatively accurately. Most of the routes the characters take a very true to how the streets pan out in real life. Normally in films set here you get characters walking out of their flat and they're right by the Thames immediately.

There were a few things that bugged me. Despite all the psychic connections and time travel, the least realistic element of the film was a student being able to live on her own in Zone 1 (hah!) while presumably still paying for her student accommodation (yeah, just try getting out of one of those contracts, they're iron-clad). Maybe she had inheritance from her parents - her family pad in Redruth was pretty swish after all.

Also, trying to stab someone in the head with a pair of scissors...Feels a lot like attempted murder and I don't think you could just get away with it like that. But I'm just nitpicking.

Overall I give this film a *bloody brilliant* out of ten.",qi2dn4
hj5mw1q,"I went into the movie blind and came out really unsatisfied. I thought Eloise needed serious psychiatric help that she never received. She nearly stabbed someone and got to walk away. I expected her to actually solve Sandy’s murder to make all the visons worth it so the twist made the whole story pointless to me.
But what pissed me off the most was John’s storyline. It’s definitely because I’m a black woman but when I watched the scene with Elle and John in the bedroom it enraged me. So many black men have lost their lives because someone THOUGHT they raped a white woman. Once I saw them get back together the movie lost me entirely. She’s legitimately dangerous and can’t tell reality from dreams, and her dreams aren’t even an accurate retelling of past events. She spent the whole movie ruining peoples lives and facing no consequences. The relationship was forced, she had no outstanding redeemable qualities, and she ended up just copying 60s designs that already existed. 4/10",qi2dn4
hikn1lu,"This film is a strange one. Whilst obviously visually stunning and embedded with the usual charms and style of Wright’s direction, it just felt kind of… weak. Whilst some things are good and others mediocre, nothing story-wise seemed to properly excel; there’s nothing remarkable. That being said, it was probably the funniest horror film I’ve seen and besides the last act, which by far was the truest exemplification of this films inability to properly stick the landing, it was a somewhat compelling and interesting thriller that wasted itself by getting caught in its own questions and answers.",qi2dn4
hiqc1p7,I like it overall but I thought the stakes would have been more immediate if we knew more of the logic regarding the ghosts/visions. Like sometimes Ellie could run right through them but other times they could grab or interfere with her? Also I would have liked more time in the 60s to flesh Sandy out a bit more before shit went down.,qi2dn4
hisgvkm,"Cool movie. Great soundtrack, visuals and overall mood. Great performances and a (mostly) enjoyable story. There's plenty to pick apart about it that I didn't like as much or that maybe didn't quite 'work', but I think it had enough latent charm and character that I don't much care to. I think the movie was playing in field and not exactly trying to be something it wasn't, although it did feel about 20 minutes too long. 

That said, the finale didn't quite work for me, and it came across as a bit muddled. Like it wanted to have its cake and eat it too with everyone being both a 'bad guy' and a victim. Just a bit unclear what the movie was really trying to *say* by the end. Although maybe the bigger picture to look at is that Ellie didn't ask for any of this and was thrust into it all and her 'No' to the ghosts + just sort of running away from it all was a metaphorical rejection of the past/nostalgia in a broader sense. You do notice that in the fashion show at the end, her designs aren't straight up retro anymore and they have additions that look more modern. 

That would seem to be the main consistent throughline of the movie's themes. The ways in which seeking an identity in the past is no way to live in the present. But I think maybe the issue is I'm not sure who that message is supposed to be for, really. Like, if Tarantino had made this same movie I'd go 'Hey he's talking about himself'. But Wright isn't exactly a nostalgia farmer in his work overall. So I dunno, just seemed a bit out of focus is all, even if still coherent otherwise. 

I'll probably watch it again if it comes to streaming, I think thriller/mysteries that hinge around a twist deserve two viewings and a good litmus test for their craft is whether a second viewing re-contextualizes the twist and reveals clues you might have missed the first time through.",qi2dn4

However i did find some bits a bit clunky and had a ""just go with it vibe""

I thought the film would have been more interesting if ellie got so caught up in the dream world that she eventually dove deeper and deeper into wanting to live in the dream world forever as this ""perfect woman""

So much so that she even starts blowing off her real life dreams to stay at home in the daytime and dream about living sandys life with it progressing to her taking tablets to stay asleep etc. It would have been an even sadder story of this girls isolation and alienation from the real world. The ghosts wouldn't have even be needed and it would really be deep diving into the mental illness that took her mum.

Oh well we get a serial killer landlady instead.",qi2dn4

hjx3c3k,"I was so disappointed by this film, there isn't a single likeable character apart from John.

It annoys me more that the setting, actors, lighting, etc are wasted on this storyline, they could have been so much better utiliseed with a more fulfilling plot. It felt like a jumble of different ideas whereas they could have just picked one and really dug into it. 

I can't help but think a British Back To The Future inspired movie with time travelling record players to the 1960's could have been so much more fun.",qi2dn4
hk1esag,"If you watched this without knowing who directed it, how far down the line would you get before you guessed Edgar Wright? At no point did I feel like I was watching an Edgar Wright movie.",qi2dn4
hl6wc2e,"I've been waiting to watch Last Night In Soho ever since it was first announced. A stellar cast, an intriguing time travel mystery and the promise of Argento styled horror all sounded too good to be true.

Unfortunately, it really was.

The film starts out in its first actiincredibly well. The design of the film, from the sound (a great use of going from mono to stereo) to the visuals (the mirrors,the use of lighting and the dance scene in particular) is spectacular. Probably the finest cinematography I've seen in a long time,and certainly the best from Wright. I was on the edge of my seat,prepared for the ride.

As the film progressed I noticed it started veering into both predictable and cheesy territory and the cracks really started showing. From the moment I noticed that Lindsey had no scar, I started worrying.

Everything fell apart. I realised that the characterisation, something Wright is known for doing well, was severely lacking.

Then the cheesy ghosts…the final act of the film turned into a game of GHOST SCREAM MATT SMITH GHOST SCREAM RUN MATT SMITH SCREAM GHOST RUN. The design of the ghosts was laughably bad and having Matt Smith constantly popping up reminded me of many Doctor Who villains that were ultimately far creepier and with a fraction of the budget.

Sandy revealing her murders like a true Bond villain was so utterly ridiculous as she could have easily said “oh have fun in the countryside” and nothing would have happened to her as Ellie didn't suspect a thing.

The CGI staircase sequence looked like something straight out of a TV horror, losing all of the style and nuance the first act did so well to build up.

Then that ending…I was expecting it to be revealed that she died (wasn't she poisoned??) as the idea that after a psychotic breakdown where she narrowly missed killing the bully everybody (including said bully) is applauding and congratulating her was so unbelievably badly written that I thought there's absolutely no way this is real. But no, a perfectly happy ending was just tacked on.

I would have much preferred to see a more psychological thriller/drama where she starts getting lost in the 60s world due to her own isolation and anxiety in her real life. This would have been a very sad but poignant film exploring those themes and how modern life isn't suited to everyone. But no, we got the beginnings of a great film that descended into Scoobydooville. I mean after all we saw, the ghosts were pleading for help? That was utterly cringeworthy.

This is all such a shame as its reminded me that being this excited for a film just because it's by a certain director isn't something I should keep doing as I'll only ever be let down.

That was one hell of a shitty night in Soho.

Sincerely thought the plot twist would be her waking up in the hospital and it was all a delusion. Anyone else?",qi2dn4
hm5kza9,"The ending was anti-climactic compared to the beginning. I thought the movie was about a descent into schizophrenia. I was getting increasingly concerned for Ellie and the consequences that were likely to unfold. Instead, her visions were mostly real.

The story also became much more convoluted to make it all real, and to provide a happy ending. An interesting movie overall, but I left disappointed.",qi2dn4
hpat0sy,"I thought this film had a good story and the visuals were brilliant, but my biggest gripe is that Eloise never seemed to struggle for things. Like when she wanted a to move to a new room she got one instantly, she needed a job and got hired on the spot, etc. John was also too understanding, like Eloise is literally telling him she's seeing things from the past right in front of her and he's immediately like ""yeah I get you"" and tries to help explain that to everyone else, when everyone else has a reasonable reaction.

Looking at the positives, the acting, the visuals, choreography, costume and set design, and story were all superb. There were a lot of shots that I'm still confused how they were able to achieve, the plot-twists genuinely threw me off and you can tell a lot of care went into making the film look period accurate.

And how they made sure we knew it wasn't Jack by saying his real name like 5 times.  ""him, no that's Lindsey.  He's Lindsey.  That man's Linsey"".   And then the classic ""movie is poorly written so we'll sit the main character down in the last 5 minutes and explain exactly whats been going on""

hlpvw3g,"I absolutely love the movie - the soundtrack and sound design, the 1960s london’s set, the psychological pull for you to fear for Ellie’s life yet contemplate whether all of these actually did happen. 

I agree that the perfect beautiful happy ending ruined a bit of the music for me. From a more realistic view, she has schizophrenia and it’s repeatedly mentioned throughout the whole movie esp with a strong FHx of it. 

All of these could be her invasive hallucinations/delusions. Because - let’s be real, how is it that John is perfectly well after he was stabbed. Perhaps it was ages later that it happened. And the final scene of (young) Sandy appearing in her mirror with her mother? If it were to really be what Sandy said then she should not have appeared in the last scene since she has passed away? Unless all of these are just her hallucinations after all? You could argue that she can see spirits and she can continue to see young Sandy I guess …

To all the people who will probably never see this wondering why Eloise saw Sandy 'die' despite being alive and other aspects of her visions that didn't line up, this is explained in the scene with the pub owner. The one where Ellie is staying back trying to avoid going home. She asks her if she believes in ghosts and the owner talks about how the only ghosts are the memories and emotions of all the people who have been there having fun and being drunk soaking into the building. This is what is happening in the house. Sandy's memories twisting what happened from her strong emotions attached to the place warping the emotions of the actual ghosts hence why the dead men have that haunted, indistinct face look. Hence turning her murders into her 'deaths'. Because those are the ghosts of her emotions, her memories, soaking into the building. The actual ghosts and the ghost of the house itself attach to Ellie.

&#x200B;

And the roommate with the drink was a red herring. Much like the misdirect on Lindsey played up to make you think it is Jack. To make you doubt. And Ellie wasn't getting tea from older Sandy beforehand, just that night to make it look like suicide. The movie sets up at the start that she's had experiences like this before. She's not being drugged to have these visions.",qi2dn4
hnfyb0d,"It was my most anticipating film this year and I was so hyped to watch it. After watching it, I have a really mixed feeling.

I really love the first half of the film. Visually and musically, it was what I expected and was as great as Edgar Wright's last films. The opening scene Ellie dancing in her newspaper dress was so romantic and lovely, it really reminds me of 60s romance films. I was soaked in the film right away.

But as the story goes on, it felt like it's falling apart. Horror genre wasn't blended well and the third act was suffering from poor writing. I wish they took out all those horror elements and focused on time instead. Since the film showed Ellie's dream had an effect on her real life (her hickey), I expected Ellie would have more proactive role in her dream. But film totally ditched that and made her passive witness. There was nothing she could do about anything that happened to her till the end. I think that is the biggest mistake in this film.

>!The twist, I have to admit, I didn't see it coming at all, but it was executed very poorly and wasn't convincing, either. Sandy holding it against those men, I understand, but her being a psychopath serial killer? I couldn't buy it. If the film showed me a hint or foreshadowing of her madness, I would have understood. But the first half of the film just depicted her as an innocent girl who had a dream. If they had wanted to stick to Sandy-being-a-killer, they should have invest more time on Sandy's character development, not 'spooky' ghosts scaring a little girl. (Ghost design was the worst design in this film. NOT, SCARY, AT ALL)!<

higqyhs,"The beginning of this movie was kinda strange to me. It just…started. And not in like any abnormal way, it just felt very uncinematic, I don’t know why. It didn’t pull me in like Wrights quick editing and awesome pacing usually does.

But it was quite thrilling once it got started. Most of the soundtrack worked but I really don’t think the lead was cast well. She didn’t have enough to carry the film and I think the two leads should’ve switched so that Anna Taylor had more of the speaking role. 

The end was a bit too campy for me, I was on board until it got to the ghosts asking for help. I didn’t make sense for the landlord to poison her since everyone thought she was crazy anyways. She was going to leave London and go home? Why would you poison her and risk getting caught?

I don’t know, I really loved this movie, I just thought the characters were under developed and the casting was off for the present day. The cinematography was great and soundtrack was great when it was in the 60s. Once again, present day just felt like an amateur had done it compared to the 60s, really strange that it was all over the place.

Still, I loved it, I’d recommend it and I’ll definitely be watching it again at Halloween next year.

In terms of his filmography, I’d rank it above Worlds End and Baby Driver(I’m rare though, I really didn’t like Baby Driver), but below Hot Fuzz, which is one of the best slashers ever and Shaun of the Dead, the best zombie movie ever. It’s a solid 8/10 movie.",qi2dn4

hio84si,"It didn't stick the landing which was a shame, because I left feeling slightly disappointed before remembering just how fucking good the rest of it was. 

All the sequences in the 60s were beautiful and really well shot. Loved the shots of Sandy walking down the stairs with Eloise in the mirror. Well, everything in the past actually. That first time she enters the past was beautiful, and really reminded me of what I love about movies. 

The climax felt kinda cheap and also overproduced. The bit with Sandy walking up those really overdesigned CGI stairs betrayed the more subtle/grounded aesthetic. Feel like it would have worked better with normal stairs. And I'm not sure about the ghosts either. They felt a little goofy but it's really hard to get something like that right. 

It's a shame all my problems are with the ending because it's all I can think about lol. I really loved the rest of the film, and I'll see it again next weekend with some friends.

hj6qys0,"I'm not surprised at the adverse reactions to the ending of this movie. I get wanting to dig through the messy, morally gray ashes of a murderess's house to find a Moral. But this movie wasn't about spoon feeding you a lesson about how ""it's okay to murder people if it's justified"" and that the lesson wasn't ruined by the reveal at the end. The reveal wasn't a shock twist—the reveal was the ""moral"" that people are looking for and feeling like they didn't get.  
The Moral is letting go of the beauty and the idealized version of the past, but you're also asked as an audience to let go of the idealized version of Sandy that you've been presented with. Audiences want the innocent, pretty blonde who righteously murders men who deserve it, not the reality of what she was doing and who it turned her into.  
The ending might feel clunky, to some, for showing us the more malicious side of Sandy. But if you really, REALLY pay attention to Anya Taylor Joy's performance, that side of her was always there. The movie set it in front of you (in some obvious ways, when you look back) but you're so tied to Eloise's perspective that you choose to willfully ignore those things too.",qi2dn4

>!Ellie's were powers and the room's powers changed randomly throughout the movie. In the beginning, she can see a realistic version of her dead mother. This is thrown out the window after a few dreams and now she sees Jack and the Johns. Except, Jack is realistic and the Johns are half monster. Now, they apparently can haunt her in her dreams as well as real life. She also sees Sandy; injured and unharmed versions. So, we now have her dead mom who watches over her, Jack who is hunting her, the John's who have turned into monsters, and Sandy who is still alive in the real world but still can somehow be seen as a spirit in a similar way to Jack. They each interact with Ellie differently for no apparent reason. Sometimes Ellie can see people where there is nothing and sometimes she sees the visions as a replacement for real-life people. Sometimes the visions are accurate to what happened in the past and include actual spirits following her and sometimes they're completely made up and just visions Ellie's mind has made up.!<




>!The dreams seen in the room also make 0 sense. One night Ellie wakes up with a mark on her neck from the dreams. This implies what happens in the dreams can affect the real world. Except nothing else that happens in the dreams seems to affect the real world.!<




>!The characters are written terribly. The love interest is rejected by Ellie a number of times, watches Ellie stare into nothingness while screaming in her room, watches Ellie almost kill another classmate with scissors, and generally just act like a schizo. And, yet, views all of this as ""accidents"" or just Ellie having some weird beliefs. No person has ever acted like this in real life. A person would instantly distance themselves or try to get the person psychiatric help; not continue to try to start a relationship. This is a caricature of a person. !<

Despite this, she is able instantly move out of her college dorm and move into a single apartment in LONDON which required 2 month's rent upfront as well as a very large deposit. When she goes shopping for 60's clothes she finds a white coat similar to a coat Sandy wears. She finds out it costs £300+. Which she buys. Ellie has spent literal thousands of pounds in a single month and has no problem continuing to waste money because the story demands for this small-town college girl to randomly be extremely wealthy. !<



>!The bully isn't realistic in any way. This is a fashion school in a time period close to 2021. Who is going to make fun of another student for making their own clothes and wearing them? This is literally one of the coolest thing a fashion student could possibly do. She also tries to one-up Ellie when Ellie mentions her mother killed herself by mentioning her uncle killed himself. Nobody does shit like this in real life. Not even the worst bullies. This is another caricature.!<










>!The fashion professor makes no sense. All Ellie did was copy the design of a very common style of 60's dress. No fashion professor would allow this to happen. And they especially wouldn't spend every class talking about how smart Ellie is and how good her idea was and how she shouldn't give up. How unexpected. The teacher encourages and treats the main character like a genius even though they have done nothing special. Yet another caricature.  !<





>!Grandma Sandy is a caricature of an evil villain. She poisons Ellie then instantly reveals to Ellie that she poisoned her. Or you know, you could just not tell her and she would keep drinking the poison. Then her friend would knock, Sandy would see him through the window, invite him in, and poison him too. Instead, Sandy reveals her master plan and instantly stabs the friend allowing Ellie to run while the building catches on fire. Wow, good thing Sandy made the same mistake every single other movie villain makes or she would have gotten away with it.!<







My girlfriend's complaint is that Edgar Wright doesn't know how to write female characters. I would argue that Wright doesn't know how to write any character. None of them made any amount of sense and the nonsensical story only exaugurated that fact.",qi2dn4

him6l53,"Writing was horrible. The visions honesty don’t make any sense when you begin to inspect specific scenes. The twists were very uneventful and I still don’t know what the director is trying to convey about sandy. Good or bad or what…

Also the sex work shaming felt weird. Yes being pimped is not okay but I don’t think the men knew that? Do you deserve to die of you have sex with a prostitute? The FX were terrible as well imo, seemed very low quality and cheap. Anya wasn’t even utilized even though she is clearly the best actor in this cast, although it might not of mattered because the writing was so bad. 

I did enjoy the music and some of the set design was interesting. 

1/10",qi2dn4
hih5vz7,"This also felt like they just casted Anya for her looks, because aside from physicality, she seems so under utilized acting wise. Super pretty to look at throughout the film!",qi2dn4
hihqgwk,"I was giving it a 7/10 for the first 2/3 of the movie. Ruining my enjoyment was that I felt the trailer pretty much told the story pretty effectively within 2 minutes and I had seen that at least 20 times because of AMC A-List, so there were no surprises until the twist. But a good twist it was not. My score immediately dropped to a 5/10 and driving home talking about it with others, I can't go higher than a 4/10 as the rest of the experience is now tainted. The movie needed a solid ending to keep this from being a shallow experience. Some major things ruining this for me:

\- Anya had nothing to really chew on other than show off the ability she should be cast in a musical some day. Other than that, she's just Edgar Wright's hot toy doll to utilize as an alluring figure.

\- Thomasin just couldn't hold the movie well as the lead. Her voice is kinda one-note and got a bit annoying halfway through. Her character is given all this bit about her mother who committed suicide and I'm not even sure why.

\- The unreliable narrative. We are literally shown Sandy being killed, just to be told, ha, just kidding, she was the one killing. Who is haunting our lead then? Why are they showing her this with the visions? Out of all the people who stayed there, why show her?

\- Speaking of the ghosts, the ""help us"" bit was so lame. You sure are being hella spooky if that's what you want.

\- Old Sandy literally didn't even have to tell her monologue. The girl was literally leaving and she would've known nothing. She went out of her way to make it known she was the one who killed all those men. Then now she HAS to kill her. Oh, nevermind again, now I have to die. I hated that so much.

\- After this whole traumatic experience, these pieces are now being used in a fashion show?

This movie was very clearly a passion project that nobody told Edgar Wright ""no"" on. He atteneded our screening to talk and he rambled on and on about how he pitched this movie to several people and the twist is the one thing they always noted they loved. C'mon, it's literally the WORST part of the movie and most people on this thread agree. I'm not sure how his co-writer didn't step in and clean up this mess. Obviously this was his fantasy on a visual level but that's it, there's nothing more here to really unpack and it could've used something to really say or at least be genuinely thrilling. I won't dare say his other films are symbolic of something deep and profound, but at least their narratives worked, including The World's End, which is (or at least WAS) my least favorite of his.

Was very disappointed and even seeing him in person to talk about it didn't help. This is one of my top five favorite filmmakers of all time out with a new movie and only 10 feet away from me, yet even with him in my presence, I couldn't help but feel insanely underwhelmed. Again, 4/10.",qi2dn4
higqhe9,"The reveals/twists weren’t as effective as other movies like The Prestige, Arrival or Inception to name a few. Easily guessed the old man’s but not the house lady’s. 

Overall it was an fun time at the movies with great performances by Anya as usual and an even greater performance by McKenzie. And Olenna Tyrell doing what she does best. Btw, I didn’t know Diana Riggs was in this movie and didn’t recognize her as >! Older Sandie !< until the credits rolled.  

Lastly, did anyone else get Sam Raimi’s ‘Drag Me to Hell’ vibes in the final act of the film?",qi2dn4
hih28zy,"Man that bedroom would have smelled awful lol

Definitely a fun movie but I felt the repetitiveness of it; it also fell into the trope of daytime being a safe escape from nighttime (at least until Ellie really started breaking down). The twists were nice surprises but ultimately predictable. Have to wonder how Ellie nearly stabbing Jocasta was smoothed over as well. 

I didn’t like how the last vision of the ghosts of Sandy’s past had them begging for justice. Though she was clearly abused and pushed past several limits, Sandy’s actions were still horrifying on their own merit and didn’t need to show those sleazes as victims, even if they were.

The visuals were exceptional though, and the performances delivered by the McKenzie, Taylor-Joy and Smith were great. The style, costume/set design and soundtrack were all awesome as well. Overall for me, a solid 6.5-7/10, somewhat forgettable story but fantastic to watch and feel immersed in.",qi2dn4
higo2qa,"Saw this earlier today. What an incredible film, Wright has outdone himself again. The performances were amazing, the visuals were perfect and it was actually pretty spooky at points. Not sure why this got such a low critic score! Probably my favorite movie to come out this year.",qi2dn4
him25x7,"I thought the 1960s set pieces were absolutely amazing. The very first 60s sequence, when Eloise is walking into Cafe de Paris, oddly made me emotional — not sure why, it just did. I think that entire Cafe de Paris sequence, all around, is among the best-crafted set pieces Edgar Wright has ever made. 

When the horror started to kick in, I was with it, it kept me hooked, Thomason McKenzie really sold it. For some reason, I didn’t love the look of the ghouls. I loved one of the first scenes, when she’s in her bedroom and the ghost changing faces was approaching her — but when she was panicking around Soho in broad daylight, seeing a hundred big gray ghouls screeching at her, that just didn’t work for me. But again, overall, McKenzie was great and really sold that torment she was being put through. 

I actually liked the twist quite a bit and liked how the movie wrapped up very much, although I’m not sure how I felt about the flashes of Sadie on the giant red fiery staircase. 

I do want to see it again eventually. My expectations were astronomically high, so naturally there’s some level of disappointment that I feel. But I remember feeling this same way immediately after seeing The World’s End, which I NOW consider to be Edgar Wright’s best and most mature film. So maybe I need to sit with this one for some time.",qi2dn4
hist9dw,"I thought the woman who played Eloise understood the assignment. She was natural in her portrayal of both boldness and brashness in the same character. I also appreciated her care for Sandy. I think it relates to women being her social circle and also her trying to protect a tortured woman like she may have wished she could have done with her mom.

It was also nice to see a character who was in some ways initially portrayed as a young, “innocent” woman be an assertive and empowered badass rather than making it a story of how she was taken advantage of due to her naïveté, which would be a more common trope (and was somewhat Sandi).

Jacasta foreshadowed that a bit when she said something like “get a few drinks in her and I bet she’s full of filth” - this was in a sexual context but I think it parallels the idea of her supposed meekness being an inaccurate portrayal of her as she has a lot of bravery in the face of fear to protect Sandy.",qi2dn4
hitjnfd,I have never seen a bad performance from Thomasin McKenzie and that streak continues. The late Diana Rigg sold the fuck out of the twist.,qi2dn4
hjrhk77,All these ghosts and the scariest thing in the movie was John’s face when he said “I can keep you up!”,qi2dn4
hinqkxn,"In my opinion, this film was visually stunning and stylish, but rang extremely hollow from a story perspective. Eloise is constantly reacting to every malady thrown her way in act II, never takes control until a stop at the police station that felt entirely out of place. She runs...is she losing it? We don’t know...let’s run some more to a red herring that has had next to no development making me give no shits when he dies.

By the time the antagonist is revealed, the completely ridiculous staircase scene that was the very definition of style over substance, to the reveal that the men were just tortured souls that wish to be freed, so now the murderer has a change of heart despite the fact that we’ve just spent two hours drilling into the viewer’s head that these very men were to be despised.

This really felt like Wright’s veiled anti #metoo movie in so many ways to the point that when I walked away from this drivel, I felt like I needed a shower.",qi2dn4
hip86du,"Has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. So much waiting and anticipating for a B horror movie, I'm baffled honestly. It's genuinely awful. 

Visually, it's not good, putting neon colors doesn't negate the disgusting CGIs and poor camerawork. I'm surprised so many of you enjoyed the visuals, I didn't find anything remotely interesting or fresh about them but then again, I had just seen *The French Dispatch* (which is not great either) so yeah there was a huge gap in the visual department lol.

The story is honestly just profoundly stupid and it's frustrating because it starts out interesting but then everything just completely falls apart further and further as it goes. It's so repetitive and stupid and cliché, you could've told me this was a Blumhouse movie and I wouldn't be surprised (even though lately BH's been doing stuff that's 100 times better than this). 

The end is just so cheap, actually everything in this feels cheap and messy. It also just doesn't make any sense *at all*, like what exactly was the point ? What does this movie want to say ? 

I just saw it and I'm just angry at it and genuinely dumbfounded at how someone with Wright's background could make something like this tbh.",qi2dn4
higuith,"This movie was a mess. You launch into it knowing she’s special but there’s no weight to it, and by the end no real explanation as to why she’s experiencing all the visions. 

The motif of the faceless men/victims was so fucking overwrought. I thought they’d eventually move on but no..

I will give the movie credit for clever misdirection but the reveal still felt very generic, and like something done a million times before. 

The ending was also weirdly saccharine. It felt like it was from a different movie.",qi2dn4
higtay9,"I was beyond disappointed by the ending. The first half of this movie is utterly delightful and Wright's direction is top notch as usual. Then that twist happens and all my good will towards it went out the window. 

It's even more disappointing because I'm not sure what this movie is even trying to say? Usually Wright plays with genre pastiche to get at something else specifically, but this kind of stays in one lane stylistically but about a thousand different (and contradictory) things thematically. 

Anyway, I think this is Wright's first true stinker. But hey, it still has the great first half and this is definitely the kind of bad movie that only a good filmmaker can make.",qi2dn4
hilyy7z,"How many times in this movie did we see the scene where Ella is acting crazy and running from ghosts and John says “Ella, wait!”

It felt like it was every 5 minutes towards the end. Just over and over and over on a loop. And nothing really came of it. John was such an incredibly hollow character. Just like the ripoff Regina George from the art school. I thought her overbearing rudeness would come into play later, and it never did. 

Expected a lot from Edgar. Got a little bit.",qi2dn4
him9w4b,"some thoughts: 

•basically /r/lewronggeneration: the movie. 


•Cosmo Kramer would’ve been losing his shit with that French Bistro sign. 


•serious Sixth Sense vibes. in a lot of ways it felt inspired by Shamalan’s good movies, even more so with the twist at the end. 


•soundtrack was on point, as per usual from Mr. Wright. 


•lots of awesome shots in this one. my favorite was probably the scene where the mirror on the staircase of the club is kinda ruffled and Sandy’s walking is just normal, but Ellie’s is ripples throughout the mirror. all of the subtle shots of Ellie in like windows and stuff was also a great touch. 


•both Thomasin and Anya are very cool actors. “Old” and Queen’s Gambit are some of my favorite media of the past year so very cool to see them work together. 


•kinda got the sense that this movie was important to make for Edgar Wright after Kevin Spacey getting me too’d after Baby Driver. felt in a lot of ways it was him saying “I don’t vibe with that shit.”

overall, 8.5/10. arguably one of Wright’s weaker movies and definitely not as good as Baby Driver or even Scott Pilgrim, but you have to give the man credit for how creative he is. I truly love that he’s someone who can just come up with an original idea and just go make the movies he wants to make. not that he’s any stranger to adapting IP, but his movies are most of the time from his brain and to me that makes them just a bit more special. so yeah, not my favorite Edgar Wright movie, but still very enjoyable and I look forward to watching it several times over like I do with all of his movies.",qi2dn4
hiuqx37,"Wow surprised I’m in the minority here, my girlfriend and I absolutely hated it. The opening was fairly slow and I didn’t get interested until about 25 minutes in once she’s starting to have her first day dream and then really enjoyed her working with fashion from those visions, but the moment the horror started It came across and bland and really poorly written with the main characters reactions, also what is up with the puppy dog boyfriend following this woman around? Like she showed zero interest in him for like their first three encounters, and then even after flirting back with him when he gave the coke can she came off as seriously crazy right after, like dude walk away. Also, who the fuck wants to bang some dude after seeing haunted visions? Especially after having said visions from the bedroom YOU WILL BE IN!? Like use your brain lady Jesus christ",qi2dn4
hj3907q,"Holy shit did I hate this. 

Edgar Wright's direction is too masterful on a technical level to be wasted on this silly bullshit. One of the rare films that actively annoyed me enough to cause physical discomfort.

Watching this was like being the victim of a wiffle ball bat attack: all blunt force trauma with no weight behind any of it. 

Every on-the-nose symbol RSVP'd for this one. Not even discreet or informed (emotionally/experientially/etc.) enough to qualify as allegory. 

All I'll say, to avoid spoilers, is that Wright could have given a brother one personality trait besides addicted to a white girl he hardly knows beyond all common sense, dignity, and reason. Makes fucking Finn from Star Wars look like Malcolm X. No. That's not the crux of my issue with the movie, but worth pointing out.",qi2dn4

hj4z3og,"I wasn't a fan of this film at all, in fact it is in my top 3 least favourite of the entire year. It felt like a disney produced Giallo attempt. Wright isn't the right person to make a film that wants to be Repulsion/an Italian exploitation flick; his films aren't known for being erotic, dangerous or just down right perverted (which is what all of the films he wants this to be are). Alongside the absolute laughable writing (seriously, no students or young people act/talk like that) and the bizarre social commentary (that often tangled itself into being accidentally misogynistic and racist) it was just a slog to get through. No idea how this got an 18, I am convinced that Wright somehow bribed the BBFC to give this a higher rating so that it seemed more like a ""real horror"". The gore was shoddy and the effects of the faceless men weren't remotely scary, although none of this film was. People should just watch a Lucio Fulci or Sergio Martino if they want some unhinged, supernatural sleaze",qi2dn4
hip60an,"I thought it was visually stunning, the acting was great, (Diana Rigg was phenomenal in her final role) and the actual watch was a lot of fun. 
However, as soon as you think about the plot for any length of time it really does fall flat on its face. 
I get what they were trying to do but I think it was trying to be far too clever for its own good and in the end it had far too many plot holes for my liking and it ruined it a bit then. 
It may be me being fussy or it may just be what it is, not too sure.",qi2dn4
hipqj19,"I have to admit I’m not usually a fan of horror films but saw the trailer so though you know what sure let’s try something new, and it’s instantly one of my favourites for the genre. It’s clever and witty, and portrays the madness and desperation of both sandy and Eloise perfectly",qi2dn4
hivjqwr,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first part especially the 60's until the scene after Eloise had a vision of Sandy being ""killed"". The scares got repetitive that the scariest part was the alarm clock scene.

Unpopular opinion: I didnt actually care about the Eloise character. In the end I would even find it  satisfying if Sandy successfully killed her. The misdirection of Terrence Stamp character also didnt work for me. Is he just teasing Eloise all this time? Or is he just an old assh\*le cop?",qi2dn4

hldfe1z,"Edgar Wright's talent for visual story-telling lives up to the hype in this sleek, beatnik thriller. The opening dancing scene seems to twirl on in spirit throughout the rest of the film, the technicolor strobes and cascading mirror shots pairing nicely with the superb soundtrack to set a tempo that thrusts the film inexorably forward. One can almost tangibly sense the tension built along the way, tightening like a noose as you wait for the floor to fall beneath your feet. I'm a big fan of this wave of psychological horror that emphasizes unease over fright or shock. 

Thomasin and Anya are both stellar, not just for their acting prowess, but because the casting itself is very much on point. Thomasin as the meek but brilliantly talented new-comer living vicariously through the enigmatic, severe, and impossibly unique-looking Anya - it's easy to imagine this protagonist envisioning this idealized victim-figure. 

My only significant problems with the film lie in the plot's actual resolution. It seems to strike an off-note where the ""reality"" of what's happening doesn't match the tone of the ultra-stylized experience. The ending is also a bit perplexing, although I'm looking forward to reading different takes on where the film ultimately arrived with regards to its themes of objectification, escapism, and artistic self-expression.",qi2dn4

The performances are good and the direction/cinematography is on point, but the film devolves into overly predictable genre tropes for most of the second act and never really does anything to elevate them. Near the climax there was a moment >!where I was pleading with the movie not to do the very forced/cheesy twist I saw coming a mile away where the landlady ended up being Sandy, but the movie went ahead and did it anyway. !<

Personally, I'd say this is either the weakest or second weakest film in Wrights filmography I've seen and would probably give it a 6/10 walking away from it.

Was this whole ordeal a hallucination from the very beginning or was sandy a real person and did those events in her past actually take place? If it was all real, then how did Ellie get the ability to travel back into the past? Were we in her mind the entire time or did some the events happened in reality?

Remember, she seemed totally fine (mentally) when she first went off to school and stayed at the dorms. The hallucinations/time traveling didn’t happen until she moved into Sandy’s house.

Idk I’m so lost, that’s why I think it’s a pretty good movie lol",qi2dn4
hqva5a8,"I think that the best way to make sense out of the movie is that Eloise can see ghosts due to her mental health problems (possibly schizophrenia).

I believe they were trying to communicate with her, and she could see them because of her “gift”. I am still struggling to make sense of the hickey but other than that I absolutely loved the movie. The cast was great and the directing wasn’t bad either. Recommend!",qi2dn4

ig85saa,"I watched this movie tonight and am so disappointed primarily due to the potential it had to be a great movie but it fell so flat for me. 

The writing felt like a daytime tv script and lacked character dimension. The mean girl at first had potential when they showed her need to be the center of attention (IE the dead mother convo) but fell flat with her extremely childish writing that sounded more like childhood teasing rather than what you would expect from a college student. Another character that fell flat was the boyfriend. They never developed a true connection and it seemed like a guy that just hung around in hopes of developing a relationship. Therefore it made it hard to believe that he would be so devoted to helping her throughout the climax of the film. I don't mind a movie that has a mystery to it but the writing was so awkward in all of the present-day scenes that it made it difficult to take the characters seriously. 

I wish the wall between reality and visions were played with a little more similar to the style in Mulholland Drive or Persona. That has the viewer questioning the reality of what is going on and if the character is truly losing their sanity. I really enjoyed it when Elosie was modeling herself off of Sandie and it would have been interesting to blur the lines between the characters. 

Finally, the ending was very disappointing and I think hurt the overall message of the film. I don't know what would have been a better ending but it left a lot to be desired and cheapened the film to a cliche. Overall the cinematography was amazing and the idea was an interesting one to be explored. I just feel as if the final product had so much wasted potential. At the end of the day, I am just someone wanting to put my thoughts into the void.",qi2dn4
hihafbg,"Some thoughts: Both twists surprised me even though looking back there were hints sprinkled throughout like some of the ghosts were men from the microfiche.

The bartender 100% knew Jack was a pimp and so did the other guy from the Cafe DE Paris.

Ellie should have been a little suspicious at the 4 months rent because people leave that room in terror since it is haunted after.

I'm kinda sad that Sandi never accomplished her dreams. She had so potential and talent.

Ellie should really stop accepting random drinks people give her.

Did Sandi kill the cop who came to investigate?

Is Sandi haunting Ellie at the end?",qi2dn4
him4e5j,"This is the poster child for style over substance and is by far the biggest disappointment this year for me.

I wasn't invested in the story, nor the characters, & by the end I just couldn't care less after the questionable script decisions. For a movie as dropdead fucking gorgeous as it is, I shouldn't have been this bored. It's biggest sin is the repetitive nature of the 2nd act - it felt like watching a variation of the same thing happen for 40 minutes. Plus the ending... thematically it made zero sense bouncing back & forth so much. Pretty much every horror aspect of this felt shoehorned in as and unnecessary, especially the weird faceless men.

The more I write this the more problems I have with it. It is really well shot & beautiful to look at with great performances but the actual film is a slog with so many conflicting messages in the last 10 minutes only. Such a frustrating movie that had the chance of being good.",qi2dn4

hihnm9e,"I really liked it, but some aspects seem like things I've seen before and it's bugging me a bunch. Some examples: the ghosts in the library while doing research, the kind elderly landlady actually being the killer, the ""I promise I won't tell"" - ""I know you won't"" exchange with the poison drink, the waiting friend who gets a knife for their trouble, someone seeing things that aren't there almost injuring/killing someone and freaking everyone out. I can't point to specific examples but these specific scenes all felt so familiar to me, I think this movie did them quite well though.

If anyone happens to know of examples that fit these I'd love to hear of them.",qi2dn4
hijwa4b,"This was easily Edgar Wright's worst film (not counting pre-SOTD stuff), but I still liked it enough.

It's really well made and the performances were very solid (esp. Mackenzie and Diana Rigg RIP, what a banger of a turn to go out on). It reminded me of Midnight in Paris by dunking on our obsession with nostalgia for the past which was nice.

I like all Wright's films but never thought he was a writer for Serious Issues, didn't think the commentary about a woman's experience was particularly nuanced. Felt heavy handed.

I found the horror elements really lame and goofy though. The CGI ghoul men in the third act looked like some straight up ugly schlock.

The third act as a whole was a lot less interesting. It didn't help that most of the twists were reliant on just straight up manipulating the audience than cleverness. Like not saying Stamp's name immediately made me suspicious, and then the different angle with the stabbing obscuring who really got stabbed.

First two acts had me pretty invested but the third was just a lot of noise elevated by Rigg's performance.

I liked it even though neither the comedy nor horror elements were all that impressive to me.",qi2dn4
hisxtkm,"It’s interesting that everyone kept mocking Ellie, saying she would commit suicide but there was never any point where Ellie is suicidal even though she is overwhelmed and in survival mode while she tries to save Sandy, do fashion school, live in a new city alone as a young woman, work a bartending job, deal with persistent bullying, etc.",qi2dn4
hikw8vv,"I've seen this twice now (once at the London Film Festival and now today) and I really enjoy it myself. 

The direction and cinematography are fantastic, and I absolutely love every single frame of that first 60s vision, culminating with the gorgeous dance sequence with Thomasin McKenzie and Anya Taylor Joy interchanging around Matt Smith, just so good. 

The performances are fantastic, with Thomasin McKenzie really doing her part to carry this movie. Her phone call to her gran just as she's outside the pub and starting to lose it breaks my heart. 

Anya Taylor Joy sadly doesn't get a whole lot to do but her screen presence is off the charts in the amount she does get, and likewise with Diana Rigg, who isn't in the film that much but damn if her monologue towards the end isn't a fantastic way to go out. Then there's Matt Smith and Terence Stamp who both bring the creepiness to this film and do brilliantly at it. 

The negatives are that I feel the writing wasn't really all that strong for the modern day segments, if those had been fleshed out just that little bit more this could have been a classic, but as it stands this feels almost like 2 different movies, with the 60s sections being far more interesting than the modern day parts. 

I also feel like the characters could have used more fleshing out, even Eloise the protagonist, who has a gift and sees visions of her dead mum... Just because. (And her mum only appears twice in the movie) Then there's Terence Stamps character ""Handsy"" who's basically just there to be a red herring, which is such a shame as I would have loved to see him have a bigger part in the story. 

But still, I think overall I'd give Last Night in Soho an 8/10, not Wright's best movie, but still a damn fun time.",qi2dn4
him1d3p,"Loved the first two thirds, and then the last half hour completely flew off the rails. I’ve never seen a movie self-destruct so dramatically.

hilrivv,"First 90 minutes are excellent. Last 20 mins are terrible. 

“The objectification of women!!!!! Eloise’s life is paralleling Sandie and she will suffer the same fate because that’s how the system treats women!!!!!!.....”

But in the end she becomes a successful designer and somehow beats the system. How does her character arc earn this? Everything the movie set up about this concept (from Eloise’s naivety in the opening scene to the microaggressive taxi driver) was THROWN into the abyss with this ending.

Sandie’s story tells us that the only way to beat the system was to become the oppressor, and so she murdered all the men who raped her. Maybe a more
dire ending with Eloise paralleling this by murdering Sandie and her roommates would’ve truly earned this?  Eloise’s dreams come true, but only by creating more victims?

Or better yet - Eloise and Sandie agree to keep the past a secret (just like the men did after abusing their women), Eloise returns to the countryside and decides that fashion should simply be a home hobby, and the violent, oppressive system in London continues.

I’m not buying this happy ending. Promising Young Woman did this MUCH better.",qi2dn4

hih4boy,"While I think I liked this more than most of the people in this thread, I will say that this feels the least like an Edgar Wright film of all Edgar Wright films. The frenetic style of SotD or Hot Fuzz wasn't there. Compare the openings of those films to this one, it felt like someone entirely different. It probably wouldn't work the same way without the comedic lens put over the top of it, but it just didn't have the same vibe of his other movies.

Nevertheless, the cast was amazing. Thomasin McKenzie was great, and really put forward this anxiety in the first chunk of the film that hung over the rest. Anya Taylor-Joy was great as always, even if her role was more visual and less substantial than I would expect for her.",qi2dn4

hiilie7,"How accurate was the 60s environment? Wikipedia says that it's 1966, but looking at pictures of London in 1960s paints a whole different image imo. 

Led Zeppelin started recording their first album in 1968, in England. In the USA, Jimi Hendrix was at his peak also at that time. It really got me confused and thinking that this movie portraits a different vibe of that age, or did it the fashion and music scene changed that fast?",qi2dn4
hiksfaa,"I really enjoyed this, more magic from Edgar Wright.

I loved all the style, the 60s looked cool and I really liked the use of mirrors early on with Ellie and Sandy.

Anya-Taylor Joy and Thomasin McKenzie were both great too.

I personally didn't see the twist at the end coming, the whole time I was thinking her mother would be involved. It makes sense in hindsight given she keeps saying ""you know where to find me"" but I liked the twist a lot.

My only gripe is probably the fact the ending is way too fairytale. For starters I don't know how Eloise wasn't kicked out of college after nearly stabbing another student, and secondly it seemed pretty ridiculous John survived being stabbed and lyiing at the bottom floor in a burning building. 

Other than that a very good, enjoyable and engrossing film!",qi2dn4
hjnhtsu,"Saw it with my friend tonight. Loved the first half -- really dug the escapism of it. Disliked the second half for a few reasons... I think the horror elements failed, I didn't like the character whiplash I got from Sandy, and I didn't  understand the rules of the mythology in a way that really bothered me. Gotta say, though -- amazing casting, amazing music, and amazing cinematography. I just feel like the first half was a different movie than the second, and I really wanted to stay in the first movie.

One last thing -- I don't understand the point of Ellie seeing Sandy in the mirror at the end. It just felt like a ""oh! and one last scare!"" sorta thing. Which seems... cheap?",qi2dn4
higroth,What can I say?  The man just can’t miss.,qi2dn4
higulah,"This definitely felt like the least Edgar Wright, Edgar Wright movie, and while at first glance, I’d assume that would be a bad thing having loved his entire filmography to this point… I don’t! 

I thought Thomasin and Anya both continued their streak of great performances and were fantastic in this, Anya just being an electric performer in nearly every film I’ve seen her in. Matt Smith, I think I was expecting to have more of him in this, but his presence was felt and I really just want him to get some more big roles! Dianna Rigg and Terrence Stamp were both surprises as I had **zero clue** either were in this! 

The Lindsey reveal + the twist with Alex made for some gripping entertainment in the Final Act and I’m glad they committed to killing Alex in the end of it, even with her living on in Eloise’s mind moving on. As for Lindsey, the reveal of who he was actually felt like it made sense looking back at it, with him questioning Eloise earlier in the movie feeling a bit less creepy and more as if he was acting out of genuine concern for her, with us being in her perspective in a brand new city and having had the encounter with the taxi driver in the beginning leading to her being on edge. I’m sure some might feel it was out of place, but I really quite like what they did with throwing the twist in it that Alex was the killer and that the ghosts were calling out for help, but with Eloise’s mental health issues, it played differently. 

The dream sequences were **wild**, with the Marionette sequence really being the turning point for me, loving everything from that point on and the extended dance scene with Anya in the club going through her *clients* was just so entrancing and off-putting. 

Also shoutout for Wright still putting some comedy in this as all of his movies are known for it at this point and yet the marketing for this didn’t even hint at a level of comedy for me, so it was nice to get some laughs! 

Anyways, if you’re reading this and haven’t seen it… I dunno why you’re reading this, but go see the movie! 4 out of 5 for me!",qi2dn4
hihnd7j,"Am I the only one totally fine with the ending? Reddit normally loves morally grey characters, I thought it made Sandi more interesting if anything. She plays a victim the whole film (and she absolutely still was by the end) but now she’s in this whole other area as to whether you feel it’s justified. It was foreshadowed when Eloise was looking for information on her murder but could only find all the missing persons reports which Sandi ended up being responsible for. And idk her line “I’m not going to prison, I’ve been in one my whole life” kinda got to me. Sandi’s death being metaphorical rather than what actually happened I thought was a cool twist, maybe I’m stupid or Reddit thinks they’re really smart but I honestly didn’t see the twists coming.

Also, I’m assuming this was intentional, but I noticed how as Sandi has less choice about what happens to her, Eloise has less choice about whether she has the vision? Like at first she has to actively fall asleep and start dreaming but soon she starts getting pulled into them while she’s awake at more and more abrupt times. Idk just thought that was interesting

Anyway even if you don’t like the script (and luckily I did) this movie is fantastic technically. Dune will get all attention but I thought the cinematography and sound design were absolutely top notch throughout.",qi2dn4

hmdxin7,"Am I the only one who thought this was clearly a movie about a woman (Eloise) going slowly insane, until by the end of the movie she has a complete psychotic break and just imagines the last scene entirely? This is _Black Swan_, not a ghost story. Everything in the movie points to this:

1. Her mother suffered from mental illness and committed suicide as a result. Things like this are genetic.

2. Eloise's grandmother says that it was the stress of moving to London and trying to be a fashion designer that broke her mother, just like Eloise is doing.

3. Eloise ""sees"" her mother. This could just be a hallucination.

4. Many of Eloise's visions correspond to things happening in the real world. She hallucinates that Jocasta (her old roommate) is a ghost and almost stabs her, until she snaps out of it. She also ""sees"" the murdered Sandy in place of the model when the model is trying on her dress. These things make way more sense as psychosis, not clairvoyance.

5. Her landlady ""poisons"" her, and initially she starts to collapse, but then is miraculously able to get up, run up the stairs, fight back, etc., and then is fine. Almost like she imagined it. That whole scene is probably mostly a hallucination. She tells her landlady she's leaving, then imagines that her landlady poisons her and admits to all these murders. What likely happened was that she was psychotic, killed the landlady, stabbed her friend, and burned the house down herself. Remember, she sees _herself_ as Sandy most of the time. The last scene at the fashion show is entirely a hallucination, as she has completely broken with reality at that point. She imagines that everything is fine now, everyone loves her, her old bullies respect her, and life is great.

6. She finds out that the creepy old guy is actually the cop from her last vision, not the pimp. Except the cop only shows up in her last vision, _after_ she had already met the creepy guy. Her mind probably created a character with the same speech pattern as him unconsciously, so when he died she connected the real guy to the hallucinated guy from her dream who was based on him to begin with.

Etc. etc. This isn't a horror movie that starts out interesting and then gets cliche at the end. It's a movie about someone losing their grip with reality, and it's cliche because she's imagining it all. With that interpretation, this movie is very well-done and very depressing.",qi2dn4

My least favorite part were the jump scares, felt like they were there just to stick to the horror genre.

And then how the ghosts that were haunting her were actually trying to help her ... by grabbing her and holding her down while the house was on fire ... and then the landlady seeing the ghosts at the end before trying to slit her throat ... It went from really good and spooky to completely dumb. 

I hate that in movies. Like, they think the audience is too stupid to handle anything else. Everything has to be spoonfed to us and the ending has to be some over the top, in your face overt explanation of the entire mystery ... and then as if the ending couldn't get any worse, they show her student fashion show with sandy and her mom as if they're one big spooky family ... yeah it just felt extremely stupid to me. 

I really really really appreciate like 60-75% of the film. It's tragic to me that the final act was so horribly bad. I can't say it came as a total surprise - I was already sweating nervously at the beginning when the grandmother mentioned her ""gift"". What a shame.",qi2dn4

hlpf6ce,"Did anyone notice the little motif in the score that sounded a lot like ""I got 5 on it""? 

I think it played twice in the movie in scenes just before she goes back to the 60s. I wonder if it was a little tip of the hat to Get Out. There's parallels between the two movies I feel. Ellie being 'trapped' in Sandy's body in a way and they both have scenes of older women weaponising tea against the protagonist lol.

I think we all knew that this cast would be great and of course it was creepy and then the underlying feminism was great to see in a thriller movie.

hlxlc9j,"I’m wondering if anyone else is worried for the female police officer who came by the house. On the one hand she’s probably fine, since Sandie says that they think Eloise is unstable, so was not that worried about the police. But I thought amidst all the dead men in the microfilm there was a headline of a policewoman being killed. It seemed notable to me because there wouldn’t have been very many policewomen in London in the Sixties. On the other hand it could have been unrelated or a loose end from the past, and not imply any threat to the contemporary cop.",qi2dn4

hm07c0r,"I went into this wanting to love it based on, Anya Taylor Joy, 60's era aesthetic, time travel, some kind of spooky stuff going on.

And I do still like it, but I just have a lot of questions that the script left unanswered, and am curious why introduce certain things if they go nowhere.


The John subplot is entirely pointless. He spends half the movie telling Ellie he's here for her, and when she finally tells him what's going on he runs off after Jocasta and doesn't help her at all. And that scene, should have followed up with him catching up with her and saying what's going on with Ellie, and Jocasta having a redemption arc. I did really like that when after he stops Ellie from stabbing her he tries telling her it's okay, and she's like ""No the fuck it's not, Security!"" That was fun. But I guess Ellie just goes on to continue school anyway after trying to kill a classmate? And in the end John doesn't even come back to save her. Ellie saves him. Instead of John knocking on the door, it should have been the female detective coming to investigate, rather than Alexandra telling Ellie about the phone call. Same distraction to cause the same events, but there's 20mins you can do with other stuff.


And what's going on with the mom. I am left wondering if she actually did kill herself or not, but the movie does nothing with that. Ellie's mom had some kind of mental illness and killed herself. The suicide angle gets set up with Jocasta saying Ellie will probably slit her wrists, and it comes up again with Alexandra framing the same. So is this supposed to parallel with her mom? Did her ghost perceptive mom stumble across another murder mystery and get killed for it? Oh shit, was she one of Ms Collins previous renters? They make a point of Ellie's mom commiting suicide and her not knowing her Dad, fine, but why? You could swap out Grandma waving her off to London for her parents doing the same and nothing would change plotwise.


Well, what would change is seeing dead mom in mirrors a couple times that do nothing? It does nothing. It's just like Ellie sees a mirror and is like ""oh hi mom"". Do something with it. Like when the house is burning down have Ellie trapped upstairs and she looks in the mirror in the hallway and mom points to the stairs.


And the I love the concept of she goes to sleep in this room and is transported back in time. At first she's Ellie walking around 1965 London, but is suddenly morphed with Sandie, and it becomes a 2nd Person POV, where it switches from her being Sandie and her watching Sandie, or she's Sandie when she looks in a mirror but has no control? 

But if all rooms have ghosts because London, why do the same ghosts haunt her in the library when they died in the bedroom?


And if her visions of the past are real, then she didn't even create that dress in school from her own mind like the instructor praises her for. She literally just stole someone else's design, and gets a fashion show for it.",qi2dn4

The plot and ideas seem to be plain enough but one thing still occupies my mind. >!I wonder why Ellie takes after Sandy so much. I see it from character's perspective: Ellie adores the image of a young girl from the 60s that she sees in dreams and wants to be as cool as Sandy is - that is why she copies Sandy.!< But how does their similarity work for the movie? I mean when we have some characters that look or act alike, it is highly likely that there is a parallel between them. Besides, it seems to me that the film-makers use Ellie's appearance to explain her personality and states: the newspaper dress, halloween makeup in the second half of the movie...

ieqwqph,"After watching this last night I have an interesting theory that has not been discussed. I believe Mrs. Collins does not exist. I think the whole charector is a representation of her own mother or possibly hallucinations into her mothers past. This is hinted numerous times. Eloise is constantly reflecting in mirrors and becoming Sandy, this makes more sense if it was her mom because her mom is a part of her.  Another being the end where the mirror goes from her mom to sandie. The others are when Eloise is bartending and outside on the phone w her grandma she asks are you seeing her? And she says ""no mums not with me now"". Whats more believeable then Mrs. Collins killing 100 men and still living there is the fact that she was hallucinating that entire thing.  Mrs Collins/Sandie had a struggle in london leading to her suicide so did Eloises mom, The movie also hints that she and her mother struggle with schizophrenia which explains this possibility more. There is more evidence to back the claims but this is what I remember from watching once.",qi2dn4

I almost thought it was going to be a midnight in paris movie, then she started seeing things and then it delved into horror. It just didn't land for me as well as baby driver. Wright has this plot pathway complete where its completely different movie from beginning to end but it could've been so much better. He needed to reign in the horror and have the tonal balance of a ""Get Out"" Or go full psychological thriller like ""Black Swan"". I could've also done with noir mystery thriller like ""Nightmare Alley"". It just felt like it fell in between all those places  and it felt muddled, like it didn't know what it wanted to do. Felt like a cheesy stylized meh horror show like ""Haunting in Hill House"" by the end of it.",qi2dn4

higsmcl,"I felt it was just a couple small tweaks away from being perfect. The story, the acting, the sets, the camerawork, the effects, the music, the horror — it’s all so good. But some iffy decisions undermine so much of the film.

I hate undefined ‘magic systems’. It would’ve been so much better to have the visions start in the room. It would’ve given them a tangible, logical source, instead of that ‘okay, I guess this is just happening’ feeling.

Anya and Thomasin shone, naturally, and Wright’s playfulness with sets, cinematography, and lighting worked really well. Using the different colors of the bistro sign to signal when shifts in time and space were happening *and* to nod to red light districts was brilliant.

I feel like Terence Stamp’s arc could’ve been completely cut out and nothing would change. He was solely there to present a twist, but the way the twist was set up made it so predictable, so it was ultimately just pointless. Him getting run down by a car was just... why?

The moment in the third act that really knocked it all down for me was when the film briefly tried to flip the power dynamic and make us feel bad for the men. Like, I dunno if that was trying to represent gaslighting, but if it was, it didn’t work. It really undermined much of the moral framework and messaging established in the rest of the movie.

I really enjoyed how the camera and set design framed 60s London so beautifully, and then the story and characters peeled back the layers and deconstructed romantic nostalgia.

Overall, one of Wright’s most hit-or-miss flicks to date.",qi2dn4
hiory22,"I just came out of this and absolutely loved it-- all I could think through the last 20 min. was how it really felt to me like an 'antidote' for Lynch's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, one of my all-time favorite films (and I'm not at all big on Twin Peaks). I can't explain it well yet, but I really feel like they're companion films, subjectively speaking.

And what an incredible final role for Diana Rigg! I'll never forget her from the trippy and beautiful 1960s Midsummer's Night Dream she was in. I saw that twice in college and loved it, she was a vision.",qi2dn4
hiu6ti2,"I think this is a good example of a bad movie directed really well. But it's hard to tell if some of that was intentional as inspiration probably came from some really good horror movies as well as some trashy ones. I was reminded of another movie that came out recently called Censor which paid homage to the video nasty era and also had a protagonist that was losing their mind. Then you had the really shitty all around movie Malignant which was a bad homage to giallo horror. 

I was just disappointed with how literal it all became. How Eloise had basically a super power because the plot needs to happen. I think psychological works best when it's more abstract and you can't discern the real from the fake so it puts you in the fragile mindset of the protagonist. And often that becomes a metaphor or allegory for something larger.

Like there could have been a good story about Eloise dealing with the grief of losing her mother, or idolizing the past too much never being in the present or whatever. But that doesn't really happen. And they even try to make Collins actions justified and Eloise being all fine with it.  And despite nearly murdering a student, Eloise still is in the school and Jocasta is nice to her.

Just felt like Edgar Wright had so much inspiration it pulled the project into too many different directions but his slick presentation hides a lot of glaring storywriting and screenwriting flaws.",qi2dn4

hjjctnd,"I thought this film was not good at all sadly, the concept, cast and visuals were great but it was so tonally all over the place and the actors were delivering their lines and exposition in such a heavy handed way, like they were in a kids movie. I think supernatural films are better when they leave a little bit to the imagination - not everything has to be explained and tied up in a nice bow. Also how many times did the ghost men appear looking like devious Dr Who villains and the main character scream? How is this scary to adults? The characters also didn’t seem very consistent- Smith was charming, romantic and heroic at the beginning and with no build up turns into a pantomime villain with no redeeming features and just gets to say lines like ‘do what I tell yer!’ Everything is very black and white. Plus if it’s meant to be a ‘me too’ parable according the co writer why does Diana then chase her upstairs with a knife - causing the viewer to lose sympathy with the victim? Plus I thought some of the sexual stuff was a bit bleak and depressing and jarred with the cartoony tone of everything.",qi2dn4

hikqlqs,"Am I alone in thinking that the landlord should have gotten away with it at the end? I mean of course giving Ellie the win makes for a more happy ending but the last act sort of meander's around until we reach the inevitable conclusion.  Grandma is happy, John is a alive and being the most supportive boyfriend of all time, she's admired by her classmates and wows her teacher. Just left a sour taste in my mouth I guess. Like if you're gonna go for it then go for it. 

Scenario 1 - They all die in the fire. The police find the bodies in the floorboards. Everyone thought she was crazy but she was right in the end. Its harrowing  while being bittersweet. 

Scenario 2 - Ellie breaks through her trauma and kicks that bitch down the stairs. The knife impales her and our heroes burst through the front door in the knick of time. The police find the bodies in the floorboards. Everyone thought she was crazy but she was right in the end. 

The ghost sequences during her visions initially looked the best when they were shrouded in darkness. It was legit terrifying whenever they came on screen. That is until we see them everywhere in the day time and the effect quickly wears off. 

All in all I did enjoy the film. The visuals were engrossing and the performances were all fantastic. I just feel like Edger left a lot on the table when it came to wrapping up the last act. Having the landlady explain her plan and using flashbacks to hammer home the point had the opposite effect imo. I understood what was happening as soon as Ellie was going through the mail. Didn't need all the hand holding and dream like sequences of a killer ""chasing"" the protagonist up the stairs in slow motion. its a bit lazy anif your a fan of cinema you've seen it play out a hundred times before.

hjrtsyu,"I've only just watched Wright's filmography this year after not exposing myself to his work.  Kept meaning to with each one released but never did.  I've viewed them all except for his first which wasn't released and *Baby Driver*, in fact three today alone (*Hot Fuzz*, *World's End*, and this) and three in the theater this year (*Pilgrim*, *Sparks*, and this).  Man, for hearing so much raving about this guy, I am totally unimpressed.  It seems like his movies should be better.  He's got a nice sense of humor, some good actors in his films, a sometimes engaging aesthetic (camera work/editing).  However, his movies are terribly paced, OVERLONG slogs that after a while lose their flavor and just spin their wheels in a boring melee of fights and multiple endings.  He's an acolyte of The Scorsese/Tarantino Method© whereby you play old songs to make a film seem better than it is because the audience has a connection to the songs.  

*Soho*, like his other movies, starts out well.  It's definitely more restrained than his others.  Then after it gets deeper into Sandie's life and supposed murder, it just starts spinning its wheels.  I kept thinking that nothing was progressing.  How many times did we have to be shown the parade of faceless ghost men?  It's nice that the movie went a bit further than just anti-male/""#metoo"" bullshit and showed a female that was sort of a militant, dangerous man hater/murderer, kind of an extension of today's rhetoric.  The last scenes were so silly that by that time I had checked out.

However, this hit all the right spots for me and I loved it throughout despite any nitpicks I had or any of the actual flaws in the plot. It’s certainly style over substance, almost to a fault but I was totally enraptured in how pretty the visuals were. The pacing and creepy atmosphere built up to a crescendo at the end, which I felt did it’s job well enough. It wasn’t perfect but naturally that was the only place that it could go and it fit the tone. My only real negative is that Eloise clearly sees Sandy get stabbed in her visions, and for the reveal to be that it was only a technicality is a bit of a cop out. I guess you could argue she was seeing things from Sandy’s POV, which explains the faceless ghosts as well but it kind of played fast and loose with the rules between when Eloise and Sandy are supposed to be one and the same or when Eloise is observing Sandy once Eloise realizes the 60s aren’t all it’s cracked up to be. That first dance scene was absolutely killer though.",qi2dn4

hih2sg1,"Just coming out of a staff screening for it. We all enjoyed it so much. I think we are probably biased because James Bond destroyed our soul as it still as busy as first week but we all cheered so much  gayest movie ever and I enjoyed every single second of it.

I was concerned I overhyped it but enjoyed the ride so much.",qi2dn4
hilyr2m,"Just got back. I'm really glad we have movies like this. Edgar's movies have such a fun visual style. You can always feel the atmosphere of the places where he shoots, whether it's an old pub, a small town in the countryside, the interior of an automobile in a high speed pursuit, or a lively 60s nightclub.

Speaking of: the nightclub scenes with Sandy were all really well done, the marionet number in particular. Sandy's got a gig at the Rialto and the crowd is clapping in anticipation of an incredible performance. Only Sandy isn't the headlining performer. She's off to the side as mere eye candy for the businessmen to ogle at, and afterwards Jack begins to pawn her off to those businessmen for one night stands. You got to gradually see Sandy's descent into despair and empathize/connect with her story.

I loved Lindsey's ""fuck it, I tried"" demeaner once the twist was revealed. He wasn't a perv or a killer, he lived a life of trying to save as many women as he could and now in his old age he was all ""I'm done with this shit, fuck y'all"".

Cliché as it is, I was hoping Ellie would tell off Jocasta at some point. Fuck that one-upping attention whore bitch. But Jocasta had to watch Ellie kill it in the fashion show I suppose. That's enough.

Yeah that was a fun movie. Good stuff.",qi2dn4
hlifsl1,"What a trippy movie. I assume she was schizophrenic and everything was hallucinations and paranoia, and the lucid dreams triggered it more and more. Loved when she had episodes in the classroom and freaked out.

hih6rit,"Had some qualms with the ending, but overall really enjoyed it.  Really dug the style, the performances and the pacing especially.

hj06n65,"Saw this...

Cons:Ghosts and Ghouls are uninspired... Would be more than just enough if Eloise's blurry visions with voices surrounding her haunts her. Could've borrow some elements from Perfect Blue and Black Swan instead of resorting to Ghouls and Ghosts to trigger fear

Some music/soundtrack feels so out of place, especially the staircase sequence. Feels like straight out of Wright's comedy movie.

>!Terrence Stamp's demise is one of the most dumb death of the year, behind almost every death scene in Old.!<

The simp character is... just... adds nothing to the story. Even Debora from Baby Driver adds more to the plot

Pros:

Outstanding acting all around, Thomasin McKenzie, Anya and Diana Rigg slays their role. Matt Smith is great with whats been given too.  McKenzie showcase her range and cant wait to see her in more leading roles, Anya is electric as ever and Diana Rigg got an Oscar worthy monologue at the end.

Kinda get why the message is a little bit muddled for some people, but I'd like to compare it with Joker. Was Sandie wrong for being murderous? Yes, Although its not completely justified, she has a reasonable cause to do it, much like Joker while Mental Illness and mistreatment doesnt justify him to become murderous criminals. You can sympathize with them to some extent, but it doesnt justify their actions 100%. Much like Joker, mistreatment from the Johns also ruined Sandie completely

>!Noticed all people complained why Sandie drugged Ellie and Stabbed her BF. Sandie can't trust anyone and even if Ellie say she wouldn't, the last time she trust someone she got lured into prostitution.!< Ellie's BF is a literal witness and Sandie would be exposed if He got away.

One themes that often overlooked: Shattered aspiration between both Ellie and Sandie. Ellie's aspiration towards London, her dreams and the glamours of 60s shattered throughout the whole movie while she found out London and 1960s London is not what appears to be. Sandie has it harsher, her dreams shattered completely and instead it ruined her life forever. The other ""Be Careful of What You Wish For"" aspects that overlooked

Overall: 7/10, Lowest of Any Edgar Wright Filmography, but still enjoyable and doesn't deserve the hates that it gets from certain demographic of FilmTwitter

Additional notes: >!Fuck you Letterboxd Top Users and FilmTwitter for thinking that this is the some abomination!<",qi2dn4
hlzzyjk,"There are all kinds of ghosts and in Edgar Wright's *Last Night in Soho* we get quite the variety to choose from in this stylish trip into the 1960s with Thomasin McKenzie and Anya Taylor-Joy as our tour guides on this journey into the realm of nightmares and dreamscapes. Basically, this movie is fucking brilliant and as we are ping-ponged from joy to terror the tension and mystery of what is really happening just continues to mount until it reaches the startling conclusion.

Overall, this film is a true treat as it constantly keeps the viewer on their toes right up until the final moment making this a true masterpiece of the genre. What more could you want?",qi2dn4
hih3zbq,"The gayest movie about sexual harassment. It was an absolute ride. Its camp, it is stupid but at the same time means a lot. We had a staff screening and everybody adored it because we all live in a London because it all bring memories of that one time in a bus, that one time in a train, that one night late in Soho and its brilliant. 

Music acting and photography were on top. My bestfriend and I (both gays) literally dying at everything. It's not the movie of the century but it is definitely a ride, a wonder foe the eyes and Thomasin Mckenzie and Anya Taylor Joy did wonders.

I'm literally on a cloud because working in a cinema you hyped things a lot seeing trailers countless times and I'm so happy this movie was a complete fantasmagorical ride!

hjopnj6,"This movie had so many impressive components (editing, visuals, and of course Edgar Wright's needle drop skills) but just didn't feel complete. The lack of a consistent set of rules between the astral projection/visions and real world was frustrating. The emotional component seemed underwritten and failed to land. The story was not really consistent and seemed like it was written to fit a prompt rather than create a world. The good parts were really enjoyable, but I just felt like the entire package left a lot to be desired. Not gonna lie, though, the jump scares got me!",qi2dn4
hk9fglf,"Kept afloat by stellar performances from the female leads, Wright wastes an intriguing first act with an ending the devolves into a climax of running around London with terrible CGI monsters lunging from every direction.

Though the reveal still does take away from, because killing people it obviously wrong, I like that in the end they did reinforce that Sandy wouldn’t have done anything if the men in her life hadn’t try to take advantage of her.",qi2dn4

I thought the last ten minutes of the movie would have been a brutal knife fight between Eloise and Sandy, but nah. However, this movie knocked it out of the park with the visuals and sound.

hipdz22,"Fun flick but it didn't blow me away. Edgar Wright's attention to sound design does not disappoint, with the heavy bass of the party drowning out Ellie's wholesome 60s tunes and the subdued audio when the movie starts out, followed by the surround sound when she discovers 60s London for the first time. The last act kind of dragged on, the blatant exposition kind of undermines the tone of the rest of the film that kept you wondering what the hell was happening. Overall great acting from Ellie (the other characters felt flat), camera work, blocking, atmosphere. Wright's attention to detail makes me want to rewatch Baby Driver

hiprvp7,"I thought it was pretty good. Loved the two lead performances. I liked Thomasin McKenzie and Anya Taylor-Joy already and this is a good addition to both of their filmographies. 

And Edgar Wright handles everything wonderfully like he always does. For his first foray into horror, he gives it a nice edge of creepy tension that lingers nicely throughout. He also makes use of a great soundtrack in a way that services the film, just like in Baby Driver.

I guess my main issue was the story. I thought it was kind of a generic, predictable murder mystery at the end of the day, and the ending’s kind of abrupt and doesn’t leave much of an impact.

All in all, I enjoyed the style more than the substance. But the substance is still serviceable and the style is there in spades. Definitely recommend it, just not Edgar Wright’s best or anything.",qi2dn4

It's a fun ride that I'm grateful Edgar Wright used his clout to make something that we don't get to see often. Great sound track too.

Yeah, I acknowledge that there are real issues I had compared to other Wright's movies. The characterization is weaker than his other movies, whee everyone has a sense of an internal life and things going on. Here it feels like characters are there to serve the plot and the main character. Definitely disappointed on that front 

Problematic issues like when Eloise is having  breakdown and it looks like the black boyfriend might have the police called on him looking like assault. Not sure if it's a British culture is different from America, where a lot black men and boys are falsely accused and imprisoned. You can feel how anxious the audience got.

I think the one scene that felt like it cheated the audience was with the fakeout murder of Sandy. If Edgar Wright pulled the old ""different angle"" that made it look like Sandy was murder, it would have felt more organic to me. 

Still I was exhilarated and enthralled by how well everything is executed and building that sense of dread and seduction. I don't know how long ago this movie was made, but it was surprise to see  Diana Rigg one last time after she passed. It's too bad she and Terrence Stamp didn't have a scene together.",qi2dn4
hl5rb6j,I think the pacing of this film would have been far better if they removed all the other student characters (or at least did not make them feature as much/made them background characters).

hiimimp,It was fun! Not as tightly written or paced as most Wright films but still visually stunning. The trailers gave a lot away and I was expecting more of a spooky ooky 13 Ghosts style haunting movie. Agree with the posters here that the final third kind of dragged and ATJ didn’t have much to do. Saw the Diana Rigg twist coming but also thought Stamp and Smith were the same character. I’d give it a solid B or 7.5/10,qi2dn4

hjnbadf,same.i thought sandy and ellie’s lives would intertwine at some point. like with the hickey…i thought it was setting things up for a dissociating story line. tbh the movie would’ve been better if it was just “sandys” story. ellie felt unnecessary,qi2dn4
hka76qc,"That's how I feel. The premise was kind of let down by the story. Some were saying it was a murder mystery so I thought ""OK, a murder mystery where the protagonist travels between the 1960s and today and assumes the life of this person to piece together who did it. So cool!"" but Ellie kind of just watches the 1960s stuff from the sidelines with no input on it, gets all the information wrong anyway and the truth is revealed in a monologue.

Or a story about Ellie being able to interact with the 1960s Soho and have her actions felt on the present day and Sandy being able to travel to the modern day to see what becomes of Soho and using that to bring about change in the 60s.

At the very least they should have both been aware of the others existence.",qi2dn4

hujgzgv,"> I liked this but I can’t shake the thought that there was a better story begging to be told with the premise and first act

Her love interest, who was also a student there, was in the crowd rather than running his own.

I felt like she had concocted the whole thing in her mind, there was no Sandy, no murders. She was just having a psychotic break. Her mother was schizophrenic and it’s hinted at by the gran that she has also had episodes in the past.",qi2dn4

hllb1ol,"> Why did Ellie see Sandy had been murdered but all the other visions where accurate as to what had actually happened.

I'm late to the party, but I think she was under the influence because of the drug drink that Jocasta gave to her. Being drugged affected her ""ability"".",qi2dn4
hlbkhrd,"I don't think the visions should be taken at a face value. Sometimes they are accurate memories (most from the first half), sometimes distorted memories (murder scene), sometimes ghosts (murdered men). Hence, the perspective changes as well, at times Ellie feels what Sandy feels, at times she is merely a bystander, at times they break into her everyday life and haunt her.

So what happens in Sandy's murder scene? I think it's one of the distorted, symbolical memories. When Jack attacked Sandy, that was a final nail in the (metaphorical) coffin she's been put into ever since the abuse began. In a way, Sandy did die, or at least the part of Alexandra's personality that she represented. She was no longer optimistic and ambitious, yet naive girl; that part of her was gone.

That is why the cop says that Alex killed Sandy. While obviously he didn't know about the murders, there must have been a significant switch in her personality, which made him realize that she was no longer the same person he initially encountered. In short, Sandy died and Alex lived.

At the end, Alex is faced with both her crimes (ghosts) and Ellie's compassion, hence she once more switches into Sandy and warns Ellie to escape and save her boyfriend. Her innocent part is reclaimed in her final moments, so she is no longer just sweet Sandy, nor cruel Alex, but instead dies as a whole human being.",qi2dn4

Nobody saw the ghosts that Ellie sees during the movie. But Sandie could see it in the last scene and Jack even slapped her. I think the implication (depending on which theory you buy) is that either the bodies were literally coming back from the dead through the wooden floor, or that Ellie's psychotic break became even more real _after_ Sandie tells her that her victims are still buried in her house, causing Ellie to have her very next hallucination be that the bodies come from where Sandie told her they are (below the floor).",qi2dn4

hrmf124,"Especially since the first time around the way the shot is framed heavily implies that the drink is relevant to the plot. Meaning that it was probably spiked, meaning that there's no need to show it again",qi2dn4

hii5tos,"At my screening the guy behind me thought he'd walked into Spencer by mistake, he started to get up to go before he realised his mistake.",qi2dn4
higui3o,Does Margaret Nolan get a similar tribute? It seems in bad taste for one actress to get a tribute and the other ignored.,qi2dn4
hj8hgnv,I was thinking Princess Diana lol.,qi2dn4
hklc29z,I had just seen Spencer before walking into this and it threw me for a loop. Wasn't until Diana Rigg popped on screen that it hit me,qi2dn4
higur0z,I had no clue she was even in this so seeing her show up was a very welcome surprise!,qi2dn4
hipcggd,Tracy Bond will always have a special place,qi2dn4
hioeqm1,"Yeah. I think the line where Miss Collins says ""The music was better"" sealed it. The music was the only good thing she had to say about the 60s.",qi2dn4
hjy44dj,"This is what I talked to my partner about when we came out. The real horror from the film came from the real world misogyny, not just how horrific it was in the 60's(although the behind the scenes sequence was fantastic) but from the remarks from the taxi driver, the guys at the Freshers party, the ""everyone doing it"" ""what makes you so special"" on repeating as if the whole of London is saying it. I almost was going to be angry at the film when the male ghosts asked for help but when she said no and instead hugged sandy and recognised the horror she had been through ended up clinching the film for me. I feel like there isn't enough misogynistic horror that's true to life portrayed in bigger movies nowadays.",qi2dn4
him1pgc,I appreciate how quickly it turned for her. It took about three dreams in during the Marionette sequence before she realized that the situation was not good at all. I wish they had lived in that space longer in the movie.,qi2dn4
hilz3lt,"This movie and Midnight in Paris both do that really well and take “be careful what you wish for” to the extreme, in a good way. I think Midnight in Paris sticks the landing with that theme a little better, but LNiS does it really well too",qi2dn4
hiznq6f,I can't help think that the inclusion of Cilla Black was intentional when you look back at who she was 'friends' with in that time period.,qi2dn4
hjdopm9,I was saying this. Ppl like Ellie at first always idolize these times but people are people and people can be awful so yk there’s no ideal time,qi2dn4
hlrw39u,Bit late to this but initially I was kind of annoyed at the lewronggeneration but was very glad they explored the dark side of the decade in the entertainment industry.,qi2dn4
hiih934,This is a great point!!,qi2dn4
hioyhfa,"I mean that’s the whole point of the movie isn’t it? It did it very well, though",qi2dn4
hmu73no,">~~Last decade in~~ media ~~was~~ is really nostalgia heavy (especially for the 80's) and it's refreshing to se a new and more realistic take on it.

hnbvtvn,">And then cheapened the strongest character’s arc by turning her into a serial killer

As opposed to keeping her as a victim?",qi2dn4
hihbkvd,"To me that's what makes me like the ending; she manages to overcome/control her ""gift"" and continues to use it for her fashion.",qi2dn4
hiiqpmq,"Feel the exact same way. It just felt really muddled in what it was trying to say as well. It's like ""Sandy is good, but actually she's bad, but she's good because she killed these guys, but it's sad their spirits want to be set free, so she's bad, but also she's good.""

Also, did I miss something about how she avoided getting poisoned? Like her drink is poisoned, then she almost passes out, then she returns to full consciousness, and is just...fine again?

Idk. I love Wright but this didn't even feel like his work at times. While I in no way think Wright is lazy as a director and I'm sure he poured his heart into this, but it just felt lazy by the end.

I listened to an interview with him the other day where he said ""No director sets out to make a bad movie."" So while I don't think this was very good, I still admire Wright's work and will be there opening weekend for his next one.",qi2dn4
hih7ci3,That’s the majority tbh,qi2dn4
hio8wn6,"Yeah it falls apart a bit in the third act. I loved everything up to Sandy's death (which was fantastic and so haunting). But then as she's getting chased around by ghosts it all felt a little goofy. 

I'd rather they didn't include much supernatural stuff. The link to the past leading to her suspecting murder was nice but the climax wasn't very good.",qi2dn4
hip8lie,"Same, and that first 40mins felt like it had a cool hitcockian psychological thriller going on. The empathy and borderline obsession she had for Sandy felt very interesting and emotional, I would loved to have seen her spiral into that without the horror elements.",qi2dn4
hj8ykeu,"Yeah. The first part was great, but once it turned into ""spooky ghosts menacing the protagonist and making spooky sounds at her"", it became more tedious.  


Personally, I think it's just Edgar Wright's inexperience at the genre. I've come to feel that if your horror movie devolves into ""protagonist is menaced/chased by creepy people for an extended period of time"", either the movie needs a rewrite or a trimming because that simply isn't scary. The biggest example that I always think of is Occulus. First two thirds of the movie are genuinely unsettling and creepy. And then the finale is just kids being chased around a house by spooky people and all the tension completely drains from the movie.",qi2dn4
hippa4f,"Same. I liked the setup a lot, then it fell off a cliff. It was so repetitive, too. It was unbelievable that Ellie kept having dangerous freakouts and it was all waved away. She almost stabs a girl, ffs. 

I was very disappointed by how little we get to know Sandy's character. Any actress could have done that role. The dreams of the past never had any nuance to them. 

Also, Sandy never has any repeat clients and her pimp doesn't care or notice? These men were also not nobodies who'd have no one looking for them. 

Then Ellie saw Sandy killed but that vision was fake just for convenience? There is no internal logic to the film's central plot device.

The creepy old man was also creepy just for the sake of it? It made sense when we thought he was Jack but how tf does he instantly remember Sandy and not react to Ellie's accusations? 

And I know Edgar Wright's films have ridiculous endings but come on. Everything after Ms Collins reveals her identity makes no sense. How the fire spread to the top bedroom but the stairs were clear and Ellie stopped feeling the poison to beg a killer to come with her instead of helping John..... Ugh.",qi2dn4
hitbp41,"Opposite for me. I was kind of bored during the first half. No conflict, just another Midnight in Paris retold with a romance in Soho instead. Wasn't doing anything for me until the horror and mystery angle started",qi2dn4
hmkzvdg,20-30 mins too long. How many running from screaming figure scenes do we really need to get it?,qi2dn4
hjr2sht,"I went into this movie totally blind beyond knowing it was an Edgar Wright movie.  For the first 30-40 minutes I was excited to show the movie to my partner later.  Then it got horror-y and my partner does not like horror so that went out the window. 

The movie was fantastic though, can't wait to see it again.",qi2dn4
hipxjqe,"I fee the same way.

Just watched the film tonight. I'm not a film snob or anything but definitely watch a lot of films, and this one really fell flat for me after the 30 minute mark or so.

So many points that annoyed me (Spoilers ahead):

1. >!The film portrayed Ellie to be a highly alert individual (the taxi scene). How would she not want her landlady's full name, who lives with her? Don't landloards in the UK have to sign exchange information with their tenents, like in the US? It makes little sense especially if the film in set in present time (pre-covid though maybe). I've never heard anyone who lives with their landlords and doesn't know their name.!<
2. >! Accusing the ex-cop of murder without even confirming something as simple as his name. Just ask a little bit about him when talking with her boss. Reckless.!<
3. >!How did Ellie confuse seeing Sandie killing her pimp vs her pimp killing Sandie? She was staring at them the entire time, view unobstructed. Unlike viewers, who only get to see what is shown on screen.!<
4. >!The pimp's ghost conveniently never showing up? Only other victims?!<
5. >!The stairs stabbing scene is very awkwardly done. Why is Sandie just walking up, stab, walk up some more, instead of trying to really stab her?!<
6. >!The male ghosts keeping her away from the phone, and then a ""lead"" ghost commanding the others to back down and hand her the phone.!<
7. >!Style-wise, there are much better art-house films that do it better. Or even just mainstream Del Toro movies look nicer.!<
8. >!Music-wise, loved it. But Queen's Gambit does a better job of this in terms of provoking nostalgia. Baby Driver also imho incorporates music better than this film.!<
9. >!The message. Sandie is all ""Sorry not sorry"" but then is all ""Save yourself, save your friend"".!<
10. >!Ellie (fatally?) poisoned but maybe saved by stomach-pumping? Never explained but not a real deal-breaker.!<
11. >!That said, I like how empathetic Ellie is towards Sandie. Just wished she showed the same kind of empathy towards her own romantic interest.!<

>!(Edit: Typos)!<",qi2dn4
hkmfu37,Yeah it's like I still wanna watch the rest of what I thought this movie was about. Not to say I didn't enjoy the twist but eh.,qi2dn4
hijcbvl,"Felt the same, but the last third really brought the movie down for me.",qi2dn4
hiykpdk,Opposite here,qi2dn4
hik6omx,"Same, and even when the horse I'd kicked in I thought maybe it can go into like a cool solving the Cold Case kind of thing but yeah wasn't feeling the second half of the movie",qi2dn4
hjjfki7,Would have been perfect if she bumped into Gary Sparrow at one point,qi2dn4
hihnj2e,I had to gather myself after the film. You’d swear I went through the events in the film. Great movie!,qi2dn4
hiua3hi,[deleted],qi2dn4
hihoh40,what bad reasons?,qi2dn4
iges0r7,Maybe. Her accent and low-tone voice annoyed the shit out of me though. Her physical acting was great. Vocals? Not for me.,qi2dn4
hkkasma,"Also, Sandy orders a Vesper during an early vision.

In Casino Royale, Vesper >!commits suicide/allows herself to be killed at the end.!<",qi2dn4
hivb99j,"Same here, how did the dude not die from getting stabbed in the stomach with a giant knife? You just see him standing there clapping and smiling like nothing ever happened lol. Ellie basically killed an innocent guy (the old cop who got hit by the car) and it doesn’t affect her at all she just goes and puts on a fashion show.",qi2dn4
hk2c76g,I left uni and felt like a failure and that scene comforted and reassured me :),qi2dn4
hij4rbh,"The landlady did say at the beginning that the bistro next door meant that all that could be smelled was garlic, I assume that’s the explanation for why the bodies couldn’t be smelled.",qi2dn4
hikkolx,She mentioned in the beginning that in the summer the smell rises. Great little detail.,qi2dn4
hijoxia,At one point. By 2020 the corpses would be desiccated.,qi2dn4
hinvbjq,It was black mold.  Thats why she was trippin.,qi2dn4
hjcuw1i,"Not just the stench, but the bugs! They'd be living in the walls and under the floorboards. So gross. I can't imagine she actually had other tenants in the past few decades.",qi2dn4
hiilq3d,"Yeah I was gonna say, like did she remove the bodies at some point and just leave the souls behind or what lol? The bodies would eventually rot away the wood foundations!",qi2dn4
hk6rujz,"> This is a nitpick but - why did not a single person in the movie tell her to go to the hospital and see a doctor for her obvious mental health issues? I feel like half a dozen people were in a place to do that and just, didn't.

This was what infuriated me the most. These visions have clearly been taking place pre-uni and have put her in danger multiple times upon arriving to London, and yet not once did she or anyone else consider getting her some help. Took just over an hour for the word 'schizophrenia' to be mentioned and it was not explored or attempted to be remedied whatsoever.

Also, it's so annoying to see how few people know how to cross a road safely and look both ways. This is London, people...",qi2dn4
hkwtyub,"There’s some valid criticism but some I don’t agree with

- regarding the cliche characters. These are first year fashion students. I studied in London and knew some people from ual and it wasn’t terribley off the mark lol. 
- regarding sandy: isn’t this where your criticism for one dimensional characters comes in? I think a common theme of this movie is how London can get genuinely good people into a lot of emotional / physical trouble and people cope with it differently. Ellie’s mom decided to succumb and killed herself, Sandy did the complete opposite and became a killer. Even Ellie got Influenced: she liked the (sexual) thrill of her dreams, she started to dress differently and change but ultimately found the way back to herself. 

Was Sandy evil? Well, she became evil after years of sexual abuse and after killing dozens of men. She said it herself she died many times. 

- I don’t think all the women are passive. Essentially, there are two main protagonists: Sandy and Ellie. Sandy fell for an elaborated trick, but it was also the sixties. Ellie is mentally ill. The idea is more to show the fragility of young people going to a large city trying to live their dreams. Arguably, the two biggest bullies : old Sandy and Ellie’s roommate, are among the most aggressive people in the movie. T
- technically, the people at the police told her to go to therapy.",qi2dn4
hjux9j2,"Yeah, honestly, I thought the movie was good, but the message got muddled in the twist. Like. I feel like it asked a lot of the audience to have empathy for the sex crim ghosts even for a moment? Even Ellie tho didn't buy into it... I feel like there wasn't enough... there. If I think really hard about it, it could be a final act of aggression against the woman they assaulted to try to kill her? Or it was an attempt to continue controlling women by getting Ellie to do their bidding? I feel like there could've been more context for Sandie to get to that? It was really whiplash-y. It was a real leap for her character to take, to go from being attacked by this long time lover/abuser, to just.... slashing thru every man she brought upstairs. I feel like we missed the transition from prey to predator.

The bully girl was also a bit much for me. It's a dated trope at this point, and a bit out of place in a story that has so much rich content about men exploiting women. I understand they really wanted to portray all the dangers of being in a big city, away from family for the first time but..... it still felt stale... truly *because of decades of danger* women really are more likely to be looking out for one another, esp in a college setting. The time spent with this character *could've been used in the third act showing Sandie transition*...",qi2dn4
hjjqb5j,Totally agree,qi2dn4
hlfzu8l,Well said,qi2dn4
hins0te,"Its literally just ghosts, matt smith screams, ghosts, matt smith scream, ghosts for like an hour",qi2dn4
hih4u0k,Why were the ghosts so menacing when really they were asking for help and why did it take to the very end for them to finally get the message across as their bones were burning up?,qi2dn4
hioau20,"Agreed. Should have been a straight thriller

I also thought the ghosts were very goofy. There should have been a way to show how her dreams are traumatising her and affecting her life without CGI ghosts everywhere. If they'd have just used men in 60s attire+Jack it would have worked better.",qi2dn4
hj0ql30,"I did really like the film but I wish the horror aspects was more hidden and less visual as I'm not sure that'll age well. The scariest part for me was that taxi driver at the start and the other predatory stuff, that was genuinely unsettling.",qi2dn4
hih67w6,"I felt the exact same way, Edgar Wright's filmmaking and attention to detail to the cinematography and sound design is worth a ticket alone. But all the characters besides Ana Taylor Joy felt flat to me and the ghost segments felt forced in to give average horror fans that jolt",qi2dn4
hiqbuub,"I felt similarly.  There's a lot of interesting stuff in here and for the most part it's crafted really well, but they really hit you over the head with the ghosts in the second half.  I liked that it reached the point where she wasn't safe at any place or time of day, but the ghosts just kept being used in the same loud, overbearing way that really lost its impact after a while.  It would have been much better if they were quieter and just haunting her in the background during the day.  You couldn't forget about them, but they would build a creepy atmosphere instead of trying to do the same scare every time.",qi2dn4
hldh0dw,"The horror aspects to me just felt a little too, mainstream PG-13 horror for me to fully enjoy.  Still overall liked the movie a lot but I'm not the biggest Edgar Wright fan so I think my expectations were tempered a bit.",qi2dn4
hm66at5,"Idk, I think he did a really good job of showing how horrifying prostitution and sex trafficking is",qi2dn4
hih0fge,I feel like I could have written this comment tbh I feel the exact same way. The jump scares and horror movie men with no faces made me resent the movie every time they happened. I love Edgar Wright but this was lowkey a disappointment. Kind of wished I was seeing Dune instead the whole time,qi2dn4
hlu2inz,"Yeah I was a lot more scared when I tough she was prostituting herself and dissociating to cope with it, god that was bleak in my mind for a moment...",qi2dn4
hnfq6if,The horror elements were pretty terrible to be honest.  It ended up being extremely predictable as well,qi2dn4
hih404w,what tipped me off first was the landlady telling Ellie not to have any male guests after 8 & Jack telling Sandy he would pick her up at 8 and ending up showing up late,qi2dn4
hih8y3l,Also if she sold it and the new neighbors did any renovations and found the bodies she would have been caught.,qi2dn4
hisasvx,She also said shes lived there for as long as she can remember including quite grimly 'i worked here for many years',qi2dn4
hiikqd2,"I believe I got the following correct but don't kill me if I didn't:

The second time I watched the film, there was a major giveaway, the landlady introduces herself as Alexandria early on and when young Sandy meets the coppa she tells him her real name. 

First time watching it I only made the connection when it is revealed at the end...but that cheeky bastard Wright put the truth right in front of us.

EDIT: Turns out I was indeed mistaken. It was first said by Sandy when they left the Rialto. They are talking about a possible stage name and then Jack asks her what her real name is. She says Alexandria and then Jack says that you should stick with Sandy.

However my point was still correct. Edgar Wright just slipped it in early on....he got us.",qi2dn4
hila1jm,Garlic,qi2dn4
hjy8maq,"For me, what tipped me off, as a dumbass that I am (no, I didn't pick up on the ""real first name"" thing, or the music comment, or the time boys weren't allowed over), was her hair. She still had the bump.",qi2dn4
hj8olgd,"I suspected the landlady would be up to no good. At one point I thought she'd be Sandie, but then we saw Sandie die so it wasn't a concrete theory for me. 

I was more banking on her killing her female tenants, including Sandie way back when, but that didn't pan out either.

There was also a point where I thought the landlady would be Sandie and that Jack would be alive, living in the house, unbeknownst to Ellie. 

I never suspected her of being a serial killer of men. Pretty interesting.",qi2dn4
hikytou,For me the biggest hint was that she was played by Diana Rigg. She’s super famous. Why would she be in the film if she wasn’t an important character?,qi2dn4
hijxlb1,"I just guessed it because there's a 60-year gap and Diana Rigg is also blonde, just felt right to me lol.",qi2dn4
hj8bdia,She also says something early on when she’s showing it to Ellie that she used to “clean up around here” or something. As if “cleaning up” for her was her killing all those sleazy men there,qi2dn4
hkoo3ol,"See I thought it was going to be her Grandmother the whole time, it wasn't until we got to the mail scene that I realized what was going on.",qi2dn4
hlrq8qm,"For me it was right when she show here throught the house the first time and she tells here she lived here long time. I started to be suspicious. She looked similar, same hair as in the trailer (dis not watched others because of spoilers), age gap seemed plausible. When Matt’s character drop her at the same house after their first date I got my confirmation and thought they don’t want to hide it as big secret. I was bit thrown away when they show Sandy dying but thought that she probably survived. Name on the envelope sealed it for me. Did not expected serial killer twist and gialloesque wrong memory twist (with who actually died in the stabbing).",qi2dn4
hih8bg0,I saw it with a couple people with the whole theater to ourselves and it was super fun.,qi2dn4
hihas74,"I really enjoyed it, but then again I'd enjoy anything Edgar Wright did, plus it was my first cinema trip since COVID, was saving it for something good.",qi2dn4

hihye7p,"Totally, the musical bits are so much more fun that way.",qi2dn4
hijpb89,Visually yes. It’s very engrossing,qi2dn4
hiklaqp,At the very least it’s worth watching in surround sound.,qi2dn4
hionfex,Audio mixing is optimal for theaters. Especially one effect that made me shiver.,qi2dn4
hj3qcta,The sound design alone is worth the price of admission,qi2dn4

hjroza3,The sound design is definitely worth a good system.,qi2dn4
higsqq2,Agreed. Also for some reason the final act which seemed to be trying to be more of a horror movie was actually less scary? Maybe it’s just me but the upbeat music didn’t make it as scary as earlier moments.,qi2dn4
hih2jyo,"I think the confusion surrounding whether to love or hate Sandy is intentional. She killed a lot of people, but they were essentially all men who took advantage of or victimized her, so it seems obvious that one would have mixed feelings about her.",qi2dn4
hiqc6wi,"For me the writing was a mess, and that's where most of the issues originate.",qi2dn4

hj50bnz,"I don't think he's attractive. But I do think his character is powerful, and that's what makes him tolerable to Sandy. She was out there trying to do the damn thing by herself, but if she needs a man to get her in the door for auditions and stuff, she'll tolerate it. 

I felt fairly confident that they were not trying to convince us that Matt Smith's face miraculously turned handsome in old age. So I figured old man was someone else.",qi2dn4
hipvznb,"No, he's not. As a straight woman who has multiple friends who are *super* into him, I don't get it at all, and would probably politely describe him as ugly.",qi2dn4

its ok Edgar you can add a little bit more to flesh out the ending.",qi2dn4
hiob3n5,"The fashion show ending did feel tacked on. I kinda liked Sandy in the mirror at the end, but wish it wasn't attached to the rest of the ending lol

The climax was also a little ridiculous and overproduced.",qi2dn4

higqhzl,The evil grandma really ruined the rest of the movie. Terrible plot choice.,qi2dn4
hiupnrz,"Especially the roommate giving her the cheesy smile and nod at the end after the fashion show. Yes, the same roommate Ellie almost stabbed in the face.",qi2dn4

hjb3tnx,"That final scene did feel weird, didn’t it? I’m not against there being a satisfying conclusion, but it seemed like all the weight and consequences of the story got sucked out at the last second.

There’s no further mention of that even taking place, she acts like she didn’t almost die.",qi2dn4

I thought they could have made more of the scene where Ellie screams repeatedly for him to get off her, and the landlady comes up. All she would see is Ellie cowering and a strange man in her bedroom. Never mind that he is black. He would probably not risk going near Ellie again to make sure he didn't get accused of anything.",qi2dn4
hinteug,"I was very quickly like ""John needs to take a clue"" and ""No guy would work this hard for a girl he doesn't know and who clearly want nothing to do with him."" 

Either way, John was a character I could not believe.",qi2dn4
hkjb0n3,"Sorry to respond to a 15 day old post, but I still don’t think the women are written well here. Admittedly I think all the characters are both over written and under written at the same time. But as a sexual assault survivor, the fact that the most characterization we get of a female character is probably Sandie and the only characterization she actually gets is just the fact she was horribly traumatized by repeated sexual assault irks me. Like honestly we really don’t get to know much about Ellie. We know she is almost crippling socially awkward, that she sometimes sees ghosts, she LOVES the sixties, and her mom committed suicide. We get more characterization of Sandie but ONLY know about her and her arch from when she starts to get raped all the time. With all of that said, all the characters except maybe the grandmother, fell really flat for me. The modern characters were just over the top unrealistic bullies except John who was comically over the top good (like seriously dude what?). Then we have Sandie and Ellie. We know NOTHING about Sandie or her life except she was once a coat check girl and she thinks she can sing. We don’t really get a whole lot about Ellie that is not established in the opening of the film, and we don’t actually see her grow much except I guess that she‘s more confident in the end with the end sequence, but we get none of that growth on screen. And my issues with Sandie are stated above. This screenplay was all over the place, because where it struggled, it really struggled. But it was also weirdly good at other elements.

&#x200B;

ETA: This movie hides the poor characterization behind some really stellar acting too. So it’s not immediately obvious until you start thinking about it. Young Sandie works because ATJ is very charismatic. Jack works because Matt Smith is charismatic. Diana Riggs is so good. So the fact the characters are flat is kind of hidden beyond great acting.",qi2dn4
hiox4zn,"Yeah, I liked the main female lead in LNIS, so I think it is mostly a love interest problem.",qi2dn4
hixld0p,"Lol I thought the exact same thing about the love interests in the theater, relieved he can write women but the problem is relationships",qi2dn4
hikua1x,"Jacosta spiked her drink.  

A good defence for Ellie is that she was experiencing a bad trip???  That would be Jacosta's fault.",qi2dn4
hikt5zz,"Yes. 

So for me, I did a quick reality check in my head and then moved on from it. 

The next time any family or law enforcement would have seen her is when she is in hospital after almost dying from poison and fire, having a story that she was tormented by her landlady. That story would have made the news, and her name would have been involved. The next time her classmates and school would have seen her is after this all came out. Rather than bullying her for having mental breakdowns every 5 mins, they would have been like ‘ok wow she’s been dealing with stuff’ and the university would have used a similar ethos when deciding her obviously minor punishment. 

I get the feeling that when her classmates said ‘that was really brave’ after her fashion show, they were either saying ‘wow brave design choices’, but they could have also been saying ‘we know your story and that’s brave to share it through fashion’. 

either way, and in sum, I agree it doesn’t need mentioning. Her return to normal life is easily explained when real world logic is applied",qi2dn4
hjb5v2y,"I’m honestly going to have to disagree with you here. The film doesn’t need to get bogged down in minutiae to satisfy the viewer, but that event in particular was a dramatic climax that was supposed to represent the culmination of Eloise’s mental breakdown. And there’s no payoff whatsoever. No consequences, or even a reaction to the incident. It might as well have been cut completely from the movie, as it has no bearing on the finale. 

The final scene in the movie literally features Jocasta acting like her normal bratty self towards Eloise, it’s like she wasn’t almost stabbed in the face. There’s no way in hell she’d be in the same room as her after that. 

It’s fine if you’re okay with handwaving an explanation away, I do the same thing, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a glaring flaw in narrative continuity here.",qi2dn4
hilom47,"I think the problem isn't that there are no consequences, it's that nothing happens at all with the roommate at the end. It's like the movie forgot about her. After so many scenes of the two of them building up tension only to end up with no payoff or resolution. It's such an obvious hole I wonder if there was a scene but it had to be cut for some reason.",qi2dn4
hlhx0ms,"Right, so instead let's bog down the movie with the question of whether Jacosta spiked her drink or not, even though it made no difference at all.",qi2dn4
hlop2us,Channels like Cinemasins and youtubers in general have KILLED movie discussion for me. Everyone either recycles the same exact takes they hear OR they try to have the most edgelord type take but either way I enjoyed talking about movies on the internet before YouTube. I’ll go back to being old and washed up,qi2dn4
hj5p6fr,"I know she never actually killed or harmed anyone herself but I was annoyed by the lack of consequences because she did cause a lot of trouble for nothing. She wrongly harassed the wrong guy because she assumed he was Sandy’s killer. Never even knew his name. She put John in so many infuriating situations. She nearly stabbed a girl. I didn’t think she deserved a happy ending. She was emotionally immature, naive, possible suffering from mental illness. Should’ve gone back home to granny.",qi2dn4

I think it makes sense for Ellie not to have seen the full details of the stabbing, and to have looked away out of worry or fear or just hysteria.",qi2dn4
hj5oi73,Once we found out her visions weren’t completely accurate I leaned way more on the mental illness side,qi2dn4
hjne1yy,">I wish they'd lent into the mental illness aspect more

Agreed. I was really enjoying just watching a likeable main character descend into these paranoid delusions. I think the mental health aspect of it would've played better with the schizophrenic mother thing too. Nonetheless really enjoyed it",qi2dn4
hkivqug,But they did have the ghosts blend into real life. She goes to stab jocata because she believes it to be a ghost. I am firmly of the belief that she was in the midst of a psychotic break and concocted the whole thing.,qi2dn4

hipx1pg,"I'm not really sure about this.  It does seem awfully convenient that everyone is fine and she recovered and went on to live her best life.  Thinking about it more though, I feel like someone in her situation who stumbled upon a serial killer and was poisoned by said serial  killer is probably going to get a lot of leeway for her odd behavior.  Jocasta was working on her own model and the friend group were kind of shown to be followers so having them follow a brave person who revealed this decades old serial killer story makes sense.

As far as the last scene, I feel like if she were dead or otherwise hallucinating then she wouldn't have seen her mother and Sandie in the mirror, they just would've been there.  The fact that she saw them in the mirror and we establish in the first scene that she sees ghosts in mirrors tends to make me think that it was real.  I'm not 100% though, maybe it's just open to individual interpretation.",qi2dn4
hiur9g1,"I agree, I wish the ending were a bit more ambiguous- like they could have leaned into the ambiguity of it possibly being a dream. As it stands, it seemed too neatly wrapped up and tacked on. I was almost expecting a shutter island twist and seeing Ellie in a mental hospital. Maybe an interesting ending would have been to have the fashion show and everything in the dreamlike happy quality but then casually show a 1960s institutional bed in the mirror of the last shot where Sandy is seen to further play with the mental health vs. psychic gifts theme.",qi2dn4
hiqg0x2,This has to be it. She was POISONED and as far as we know she doesn't tell anybody that in time to save her life. Also we don't get any clear indication that the boyfriend is alive either.,qi2dn4

hiqpoos,The mother appeared in the beginning of the film in the mirror too. She always use to see her mother was what I understood. Though Edgar Wright does do open ended endings like with if Baby actually ever left prison in Baby Driver. I personally prefer and see Last Night in Soho that Eloise conquered her fear and demons of mental illness to where she can manage it as it will always be something she will struggle with. She also carries Sandy's legacy and wants to give the young Sandy before she was corrupted a new London legacy.,qi2dn4
hk5v34q,"I absolutely think it’s a dream and she’s dead. She was poisoned by the drink, slashed a few times, and inhaling toxic smoke. The fact that it’s such a hard cut to HAPPY!! absolutely makes me think she’s dead",qi2dn4
hiqc30v,Yeah it felt way too good to be true.,qi2dn4

im7dsxr,it's mine too,qi2dn4
hj369aq,"This. I too felt the movie managed to convey the getting over nostalgia theme, like it really sold how glamorous the time period was and then started portraying the messed up aspects and sandie's descent but maintained the surrounding atmosphere and even before the reveal at the end, older sandie does say someone died in every house and every corner and then we learn she herself turned into a serial killer. If the clothes at the fashion show in the end didn't look like they are still based on 60s or at least sandie's outfit, I would have thought that is the message the movie was going for.",qi2dn4

hiox261,That's horrible.,qi2dn4
hioztw2,"Agree with a lot of your points. Additions/disagreements/opinions:

* Most of the movie felt like a ""grown-up"" Wright film, but the bullies were such obvious caricatures it seemed like they were imported from some of his earlier comedies like *Shaun of the Dead* or *Hot Fuzz*. They just didn't seem to match the tone of the rest of the film to me.

* THE HICKEY. This drove me crazy. So she can be physically affected by the past, apparently, but for someone who is as meticulous about foreshadowing and callbacks as Wright, it irks me that there was zero payoff for that revelation. She is never physically affected again, and every time we *think* she's going to be, it turns out she's, for example, about to stab a classmate.

* Not only is John persistent, he's also named, uh, John. There are some real unfortunate parallels there. The dude also has big manic pixie dream girl energy; there's a big test tomorrow? Sure, let me ditch studying to help you scroll through a billion old news articles because I have no internal life or goals of my own.

* About the way Sandy was depicted and the justification for her not fighting harder to escape/avoid prostitution: I would argue that her and Ellie were foils in more ways than the obvious. Sandy is brash and bold and confident, but unbelievably naive. She genuinely believes she's going to just get a gig at the Cafe de Paris off the bat, trusts Jack immediately, and doesn't even investigate what kind of place the Rialto is before agreeing to work there. Ellie, on the other hand, is all wide-eyed innocence and shy uncertainty, but is quick to be suspicious of the leering cabbie, shuts down John's attempts to help when she's struggling with her suitcase, and has the nerve to find a new place and get a job when her roommate turns out to be awful. It makes sense that Sandy's naive optimism was transformed into hardened bitterness as her dreams were crushed.

* The twist that the old man was Lindsey, not Jack, was telegraphed so hard that a lot of the suspense was lost for me. I was annoyed with Ellie for not figuring it out, and with Lindsey for not being more direct with what he knew. I thought the reveal of Sandy's identity was handled much better.",qi2dn4
hj261ta,Her name was Jocasta,qi2dn4
hih78jb,"Hijacking the top comment to ask if anybody knows who played young Lindsay (Terrence Stamp).

higq46u,"Yeah you summarized the feelings myself and my fiancee had. I love Edgard Wright dearly, so I was pretty disappointed. The story and the characters just really fell flat, and I walked away wondering what the point was. I understand and respect the subject matter, but I felt so many other movies have done it before, and told the story better. This was like Promising Young Woman and Chicago at the same time. 

The ending went from being bizarre, with Sandy / Alex’s final moments, to being just plain boring, with Eloise’s “perfect happy ending” fashion show.",qi2dn4
hihkp8o,"Minus the points about horror, this how I felt about Baby Driver.",qi2dn4
hilp2p7,The movie could have been 10 minutes shorter. We spent way too long watching Ellie run from faceless ghost. Or replace those scenes with more with Sandy,qi2dn4
himnmxb,They never really played upon the fact that she got a hickie from her first dream showing stuff from then could influence her in the modern day.,qi2dn4
hio9fky,"It's a shame the third act drops the ball as I did really enjoy the rest. 

The opening wasn't as sharp as it could have been for sure. If I came into the movie not knowing about the 60s vision stuff coming later, I probably wouldn't stick around.  

The stuff about the ghosts not being a danger is too true. The most horrific scenes were the ones of her taking Sandy's place during the prostitution as it's so fucked up, especially as you think Eloise might be put through the same thing in the dream. 

They could have showed PTSD type things affecting her in the present, but they took it a little too far. The movie tried to be horror when it was better as a tighter thriller/mystery. 

Having said that I didn't think it dragged. I wasn't bored, just wished the third act was better. The ghosts felt like something out of doctor who (but again the scene on the bed with sandy in the ceiling was very well done)",qi2dn4

hjinu9w,"Agree with your points.

At least it wasn't as blunt as Promising Young Woman. God that film was overrated. This tackled the mix of genres and the theme of female exploitation leading to revenge far better.",qi2dn4
hiyeosa,"That was an enormous standout to me with LNiS, specifically that the “love interest” - if you can even call him that, since he’s so awkward and asexual - is a two-dimensional prop. At least Lily James’ character offers stakes and narrative propulsion. While watching LNiS, I couldn’t stop thinking about how unnecessary a love interest is to the screenplay, and how a female friend from the school or pub could better act as a narrative tool. Ellie needs a short-term crutch for the surprisingly short time during which she fears falling asleep (which she combats through drunken sex?!), and someone to intervene near the climax. It would’ve been so much more interesting to see a friendly confidant than a mannequin of a love interest. 

I’m starting to wonder if Edgar Wright is as clumsy IRL when it comes to romance and a womans’ perspectives as he seems to be as a screenwriter. I also wonder if, after the shit he got for Debora in Baby Driver, if the John character in LNiS is a response to that, which is insulting if that’s the case.",qi2dn4

hiq90lx,"Felt the same. But it didn’t feel like some artistic statement about how people aren’t black and white to me, it felt like Wright wanted us to understand why Sandy murdered those men without giving us any time to do so. Maybe it’s because she straight up tried to murder Ellie about five seconds after the reveal. 

I want to sympathize with Sandy and I think the movie wants us to do that too. But the adding of the ghosts who we realize were her victims sent a mixed message about everything.",qi2dn4

- her male friend was there to experience all the crazy too, thus he would be able to understand and forgive her
- this whole thing would have made the news - people would know her name and what she went through. Thus, her classmates would have the ‘ah ha’ moment, and even if they didn’t know about the whole seeing dead people thing, they would have learnt enough of the story to know she lived with a psycho woman who killed many men and thus forgive in the way of ‘ok this girl is dealing with a lot, she is more crazy, I get it now’",qi2dn4

Really was just to pull a fast one on the audience to service the twist. Also Ellie was hardcore convinced he was someone else and accusing him of murder without even getting basic information on the guy like asking the staff his name. He was there frequently.

But just telling her what Sandy did wasn't good enough in their eyes, since she'd just go to the police. So they chose to haunt Ellie first and tried to carefully reveal the past bit by bit, in hopes of manipulating her to a point where she'd kill Sandy.

Sandie thought she was auditioning to become a singer. But it turns out that she was really auditioning to become a prostitute. Jack was a scam & forced her into s*x trafficking.",qi2dn4

hikyb8m,"The money thing didn’t bother me because they addressed it. Very early on she said ‘I have a loan and bursaries’. So, she was making it clear money had been considered. When her grandmother called at the pub, she said she had to get a job because she needed to move out. I’m guessing her loan paid for student housing and her job paid for rent (bed sits in Zone 1 aren’t actually all that expensive compared to 1 Bedrooms: £700 a month to share a 6 bedroom place with 5 others, with shared bathrooms in Zone 1 - same for a bed sit with a toilet and shared bathroom. Not impossible working at the bar). Now, even if my assumption isn’t true, they fact that her grandmother didn’t ask more questions (like ‘why would you need to get a job if you move’ or ‘do you still pay rent on the student housing’) means she knew exactly what money would be needed where, because it was discussed and taken care of. And it the characters didn’t raise questions, it makes me thinks that the audience doesn’t need to ask questions because the most obvious answer is correct. 

To the point of the scissors, I explained this in another post. I don’t think the assumption is that it was swept under the rug. I think if this happened in real life, real world implications would be followed: the Uni wouldn’t be able to kick her out for mental health, her classmates and family would soon learn the story (it may even make the news and media) and even if they don’t learn she can see dead people, they would still have ‘ah ha’ moments when realizing that this girl has been dealing with a crazy landlord who killed people and start thinking ‘ahhh ok we probably shouldn’t concern ourselves with her recent behavior too much, as she’s been dealing with stuff’.",qi2dn4

This is the film I imagine a lot of women fear whenever a male director/screenwriter goes, ""I was inspired by everything going on with the Me Too movement...""

All I'll say about John is the brother was dying of thirst. Dying!

Not trying to make assumptions about Edgar Wright as a person or white knight on behalf of some hypothetical woman (I'm only speaking for myself and my own frustrations), but perhaps it shouldn't be surprising that mining the works of male directors — shouting out famed respecter-of-women Roman Polanski by name no less — for insight into the psychology of women/women's issues is doomed to superficiality. Read *Beloved* by Toni Morrison or something, I don't know...

I bring this up because A) I find social issue trauma porn tacky in general and B) such an assumption is the only ""glue"" that makes this inconsistent hodgepodge coherent and the desire to film it comprehensible. *Malignant* at least knew it slid headfirst into pants-on-head fucktarded territory... I think...(hope)...

This movie gave me a *Green Boo*k aftertaste of presenting the most flat, obvious strawman of its pet issue with a self-satisfied grin. That way, the group targeted in its critique can comfortably go, ""Hey, I'm not one of those creeps..."" Otherwise, it's taking some radical feminist position that all sexual interplay is effectively assault because it does nothing to distinguish why John's puppy dog stalking and leering is ""good"" versus all the old white dude/frat boy leering.

>!Also, casting Diane Rigg as a young Anya Taylor-Joy is sheer petulance. Eyes don't shrink like that with old age, do they? And I still predicted that twist. What other direction was there for the story to twist in once Wright went full Shyamalan? !<

The movie had to cement that the main character had psychic visions within the first few minutes, it felt heavy handed and then as a result the stabbing scene felt insulting.

This is definitely pre-Hendrix. More post-Beatlemania, Yardbirds, Kinks, Twiggy, mods/rockers, just before the hippy thing hit big. It doesn’t come across as a parody at all, like Austin Powers does.

I really loved the Thunderball poster in the first 60s scene. It told me the year (late 65/66), but also foreshadowed the theme of classy British Saville Row misogynist manhood. Most of the men in the scenes probably thought they were being James Bond. Sandy also orders a Vesper, which is a Bond reference.

Sandie's spirit bidding farewell to Ellie one last time. And I guess to say ""sorry for trying to murder you and your friend, lol"" 

Or you can look at it as Ellie seeing Sandie in the mirror for the last time. But now, Ellie is completely free of Sandie's influence.

I assume her mother had the same power.

il28jwv,"I had a similar thought too, in that Sandie mentioned she “died a hundred times in that room”. Possibly could have reinvented her whole persona and be unrecognizable to her her mother (Ellie’s grandma) and Ellie. This would mean they never would have had a funeral or anything for Ellie’s mom, but the switch to Sandie in the mirror at the end made it seem like she was Ellie’s mom to me at first thought.

Edit: now that I’m thinking about it more, could have also been a disowning of Ellie’s mom by her grandma once she started down the path she did. Since Ellie was only 7 when her mom “died”, would be easy to create a story to convince her, while ultimately being super twisted.",qi2dn4

The scary part is that Ellie's grip on reality is completely coming apart, and you have no idea what she's going to do in the real world in response to these visions. If the ghosts only showed up once then that wouldn't exactly show Ellie losing it, now would it?

>Smith was charming, romantic and heroic at the beginning and with no build up turns into a pantomime villain with no redeeming features and just gets to say lines like ‘do what I tell yer!’ 

That's not inconsistent. That's just characteristic of predators and how they behave. They stay charming exactly as long as they need to.

> Plus if it’s meant to be a ‘me too’ parable according the co writer why does Diana then chase her upstairs with a knife - causing the viewer to lose sympathy with the victim?

It's weird, it's been quite a long time since I've seen a movie with a bad ending. Most movies nowadays are fairly consistent, but the ending here really ruined it. Up to (and including) Sandie's murder I was loving it. 

I feel like when they were writing it, they didn't realise the sort of movie it'd be. The ghosts and especially the cheap horror b-movie climax really clashed with the fantastic flashback, psychological horror type thing they had going. 

The ending would have worked better as something more muted. Like finding out the landlady is Sandie, but without the stupid action. But instead understanding.

Plot - Thomasin- the lead - is a freshman fashion student, who is obsessed with the 60s, moves to London and starts getting bullied so she moves off campus and begins to have visions of Sandy, at night, during the 60s. She goes there every night in her dreams and watches as Sandys dream of being a performer end with her being whored out by her talent manager. Eventually all the men who assaulted Sandy turn into ghosts who follow Thomasin and bleed over into to her life. Eventually she thinks Sandy was murdered and brings it up to the landlord as to why she wants to leave London. The landlord reveals herself the killer, tries to kill her but ends up burning down her apartment because she knocks over a cigarette in a struggle with Thomasin. The film ends with Sandy dying in the fire, Thomasin has a successful fashion career(more of a show at school but same, same) and at the end, when she’s at peace, sees Sandy in a crowd in London.",qi2dn4
hih5eqa,"Twoish twists:

1.	An old man who the movie had been smacking you over the head with as somewhat suspicious wasn’t an older Matt Smith, but instead was an old police officer who had like 30 seconds of screentime in a 1960s flashback. Imo it was a 2/10 plot twist, as soon as he had recurring appearances as often as he did, I knew that it was unlikely that he was who the main character suspected him to be.
2.	The old landlady at the new place Thomasin McKenzie moved to is actually an old Anya Taylor-Joy, and she murdered and buried a bunch of dudes in her old attic room. She killed them because she’d been pimped out to them by Matt Smith in the 1960s flashback sequences, which is why the room she rented out to McKenzie was haunted. I felt this one was more around a 4/10 twist, some of the seeds were sprinkled in there and it was settled when they briefly flashed over some of her mail and we saw her full name.

Edit: overall plot: Thomasin McKenzie is Ellie, an aspiring fashion designer taking after her deceased mother who killed herself when Ellie was 7. Ellie would also still hallucinate said mother. She moved to London for fashion school and then quickly moved out of her dorm because her roommate sucked, and moved into a haunted room where she began having dreams of the life of Sandy (Anya Taylor-Joy) in the 1960s. Sandy wanted to become a Starlet and was told Jack (Matt Smith) would get her there. At first he seemed kind and genuine, but things began to spiral fast as he just started pimping her out. 

As Sandy’s life spiraled, Ellie’s visions and hallucinations were getting worse, until they came to a head Halloween night, when Ellie starts having waking hallucinations of her dreams and sees what she believes to be the murder of Sandy. Ellie is convinced this skeevy old dude who frequents the bar she works at is the older version of Jack, and tries to tell the police this but comes off as a bit unhinged. She has more daytime visions and nearly stabs her shitty (former) roommate with scissors thinking it’s a ghost, then confronts the old man who reveals that he’s not Jack, but instead a police officer who tried to tell Sandy to get out of the game. He then gets hit by a car and presumably dies.

Ellie decides she can’t stay in London anymore and gets her friend/modern day love interest (John) to help her leave. It’s here that her landlady reveals that she is an older Sandy and that she actually survived the encounter Ellie saw, because the stabbing and blood from that scene was actually Sandy stabbing Jack. She then reveals that it felt “right” to do, and that she killed every man that Jack had pimped her out to and buried them all under the floorboards of that bedroom, ostensibly explaining Ellie’s visions since moving in.

The final showdown involves Sandy poisoning Ellie following her villainous reveal and then stabbing John when he knocks on the door to check on Ellie for taking so long. Ellie stumbles over and accidentally sets the building on fire trying to warn John, and then throws up the poison before having a last confrontation with Sandy in the murder bedroom, where Sandy supposedly also sees the ghosts of her abusers. Sandy refuses to be taken in by the authorities and Ellie barely manages to get to the bottom floor when the fire brigade enters and saves her and John.

The end of the movie is a classic happy ending, with the 60s styles that Ellie’s been making (based on her dream flashbacks) being a smash hit and no apparent consequences have come from her nearly stabbing someone. Ellie briefly hallucinates her mother again, but after talking to her friends and family briefly, she looks back and her mother’s been replaced by a hallucination of Sandy (as Anya Taylor-Joy, not Diane Riggs).

The cop tells her you're better than this, as in, what she's allowing herself to go through instead of doing something else. And she says, ""I don't think I am \[better\]."" For me that's the most tragic line in the movie. It's her giving up her ambitions and values. She doesn't even believe in herself anymore. She ""dies"" there. Her hopes and dreams have been crushed by this point. Then she dies over and over again, as she puts it. This is the way it is. Only by becoming a killer does she feel a sense of regaining control in life for how she's been wronged. She embraces being the villain to achieve this.

hlh7ozg,"As someone who went to art school in London, the worn down factory show is not that weird. In fact it looks bog standard for a art uni outside of Central St Martin’s. 

I once had an  second year opening in a former government building that had been abandoned for years. It’s since been largely demolished and developed into something else",qi2dn4
hnp0xqn,"It was just an art showing at a college. I went to a college with a strong art program, the senior art exhibits always completely changed the place, but going past a set of doors and you're right back in a campus. It's not too oddball. That was her showcase, hence the other students prepping for theirs. He has been stabbed, he's probably out of school work for recovery.",qi2dn4
hntzx7r,"At the end When she says ""Im glad Im here to see it too"" I interpreted that as she is glad she is healthy and on meds and present in the moment rather than when she was off meds and hallucinating. And then Grandma brings up the mom, reminding us of the moms mental illness. THe mom is proud of Ellie being able to live a healthy life dispite her illness and Ellie reinforces this by saying ""I know"".

Then when she turns and sees Sandie in the mirror the music cuts in abruptly and is meant to be scary. Ellie looks horrified, like she is seeing Sandie again for the first time since meds/treatment, indicating her symptoms are getting worse again. It could be the over excitement caused from this being her first successful show or whatever, so her symptoms act up when theres any strong emotions..",qi2dn4

hjuy6fe,"Until they find out the place she was staying was a murder house, run by an old lady who drugged her.

Bet the college didn’t want their name coming up in a headline like with throwing her out. That’s probably why all those mean girls were all “you’re so brave” at the end. The story is out and it’s that she stayed at some place where she was mentally tortured and drugged and barely made it out alive with John.",qi2dn4
hlpf6fm,"Considering that she was an art/ fashion student (who may stereotypically be prone to having emotional outbursts, especially with the fact that a lot of them actually do do drugs) and that the workshop was quite intimate so her professor knew her well, I don’t find it that odd that her teacher was so patient with her tbh, especially as she may have suspected that she was being bullied + the fact that she was living in a murder house with a lady that had been drugging her.",qi2dn4

hii2j6y,"I figured the cops would have been after Ellie for the scissor thing at least and ended up beating the firemen to the house at the end, which would have at least kept that plot thread going a bit rather than just dropping it.

I think that was a nice subtle hint to that effect. Maybe not as satisfying as, I dunno, her getting something dumped on her head lol, but that might’ve been too tacky",qi2dn4
hj1j7lg,"Same. I would even have just accepted something like Jocasta giving Ellie a bitchy state after Ellie came off the runway at the end and Ellie just mouths the word ""Cunt"" at Jocasta or something.

hiu3bya,i mean Anya Taylor Joy is 5'6 and lives in the middle of London in this movie. It's easier for her to put them in the crawlspace than it is for a woman of that stature with no real income outside of johns to be able to transfer a bunch of full-grown men to other places without anyone noticing in one of the most crowded cities in the world.,qi2dn4

hjfvv9z,"Dude I was laughing my ass off at a bunch of parts idk what you’re thinking. When she was like, “I wanna make sure you’re in this for the long run.” As she fucks the slime ball on the second date — hilarious. 

Also when the bar owner reveals that Stamp’s character was a cop — when he’s lying dead on the street — the way the main actress was like WTFFFF ahahaha I’m literally laughing now thinking about how they played that reveal. 

But yeah it’s a psychological thriller about a woman going insane so you can’t have it be a bottle of gags but it definitely was good. 

You’re right though not as many laughs as in some other EW movies. For instance the scene when they’re all listening to Baby’s weird remixes of their private conversations is still hilarious.",qi2dn4
hk22ltt,"there was just the perfect amount of humor for this movie. I'll say it when I left the theater and I'll say it right here in this comment. 

Last Night in SoHo had everything a movie should have. gorgeous cinematography, thrills, chills, top tier soundtrack, perfectly timed comedy, talented leads, and the death of many men.",qi2dn4
hk8fvy3,"I don’t know about anyone else, but I had to stifle laughter when Ellie kicked Sandy’s legs out from under her and Dame Diana fell over.

I am happy that she  realised her mistake. The director didn't make her into a ruthless monster and give her a horrible end. instead she got our sympathy. I was afraid for a second that the rapists would get our sympathy when one of the ghosts said ""kill her"" being scared.",qi2dn4
hir8xt3,"Yeah exactly, there’s some real bad takes i’ve read on here where people are taking the scenes at face value without considering any kind of nuance and ignoring the actual events.

ih5h1kb,"Your right about that, I didn't think about the specific point. She comforts her and doesnt call the police. Its not ok what she went through, she did however commit murder, a lot of murder. I guess though I just assumed the fire would reveal all the dead bodies in the house. Eloise and John would obviously explain to the authorities why he was stabbed and the rest of the story. It definitely is a social commentary on abuse and basically human trafficking how the lights and glamour of fame especially back in the day could lead to people being trapped in the situation Sandi found herself in. I think the setting of London was more a metaphor for Hollywood. You could write that same story about Hollywood especially back in the 70's all the up through the 90's. especially the scene where Elloise is running through the back rooms, seeing the girls doing tricks and drugs and all the dark underbelly of Fame.",qi2dn4

iesvlhx,Yeah she lives with her grandma who I assume doesn’t work so she’d get the maximum London student maintenance loan. Bursaries can be worth quite a bit too.,qi2dn4
ige9icg,Absolutely agree. The first half of the movie was very entertaining. I really enjoyed being “whisked” into the 60s with the music and environment that was created. Once it was revealed that Jack was going to kill her and all the ghosts started showing up I didn’t enjoy it as much. The landlord being Sandy all along was a letdown to me as well.,qi2dn4
hni2p3l,Good argument well presented. Would converse again.,qi2dn4
ik6sgif,There's 4 or 5 really strange interpretations of my comment in this reply. I never said he was a weirdo for dating her (although he is). I didn't say don't be concerned.

hio8op7,"First time in a different cinema. The cinema had really quiet centre channel speakers, as even the trailers that played before the movie I couldn't hear the dialogue over the side channels blasting music. Literally watching the No Way Home trailer sounding worse than Tenet ever did

So the first 25 mins or whatever of the movie was so quiet I could barely hear anything lol. Guess it makes sense if it was only the centre speaker. 

Now to find a new cinema with better speakers lol",qi2dn4

I paused the movie several times to make sure my surround sound was working, and then wondered if maybe it was by design to make it feel more retro--then later I realized the back speakers were working but didn't really think about it.

hijd13t,"Yeah, about halfway through the movie it felt like it lost the plot. 
 
The last third really just dropped the ball with the Alex/Sandie reveal.  
It felt like the movie was trying to have it's cake and eat it too - you should feel bad for Sandy, but also what she did was monstrous, but now she's trying to kill Ellie and her boyfriend... But also she's a poor old woman who's been haunted by this for 50 years.",qi2dn4
hjhkwu8,Abuse begets abuse. If it were reduced to 'good guys' and 'bad guys' it would be a diseervice to the complexity of the topic it was adressing. The moral greyness is a reflection of the reality of the situations in which abuse often occurs.,qi2dn4
hj3m2fx,absolutely agree! it really didn’t sit well with me that sandy didn’t get a proper ending and how her character effectively turned into a slasher. i think her trauma could have been handled in a much more delicate way - hers and ellie’s! the halloween-type vibe of the dead men felt more like horror movie insanity than actual sexual assault trauma.,qi2dn4
hizk73r,"Except for the purposes of giving the movie a twist, why was Eloise experiencing these visions in the incorrect way? Like why did she picture Jack killing Sandy when that wasn't what actually happened? It just doesn't make sense to me n was one of a large list of reasons the movie completely fell off for me.   


Also like another commentor said, are we supposed to side with Sandy at the end? Because to me she was a piece of shit that was going to kill Eloise to hide her secret, but for some reason Eloise and her were still bros at the final scene? Like I guess the explanation is ""well you cut me and tried to murder me and my boyfriend but you also killed some pig men so you're cool""? Definitely not how I imagine any rational person feeling at the end of that experience.",qi2dn4
hij66h0,"I kinda liked that no one in the past was ""good"".

Not sure how ""bad"" the John's are. Not sure if there is enough info to say they are evil and raped her, or if they just thought they were doing a business transaction they thought she was willing (as much as a sex worker can be in some situations).

At the very least they were portrayed as sleazy, so when they where like ""help us"", and Elle was just like, ""no"". I thought it was funny.


Overall I thought it was fine, magically curing the poison was kinda bunk though. Maybe she didn't drink all of it, and Sandy was going to force feed her more once she passed out, or adrenaline kicked in and woke her up.",qi2dn4

hjsdeh0,could have definitely been another drug just to keep her paralyzed or from moving. she was visibly having trouble walking & getting up which is why she knocked the table over w/the ashtray that started the fire. just becoz she was drugged doesn’t mean she was poisoned. the landlady said herself “i won’t stab you like i did them” (paraphrased) so she likely could have slipped something in her tea to make her dissociate & numb.,qi2dn4

hiv0cys,"> Why were the ghosts so menacing when really they were asking for help and why did it take to the very end for them to finally get the message across as their bones were burning up?

Because they were, in the eyes of the movie ultimately, more perpetrators than victims. I’m no expert on sex work, but there is definitely a certain power imbalance implied by hiring a prostitute through a pimp in the ‘60s that wouldn’t be intrinsically there in other situations.

So were they asking for help, or were they trying to use another young women to undo some kind of justice?

It’s only been a few hours, but I admire the film more than when I was watching it. One central theme was the use and abuse of women, and it bothered me while watching that they’d undercut this theme by having a woman be the villain (she’s quite the serial killer). When I was watching it it seemed like the message was “beware the women who overreact to things,” but I think the visceral horror of the endless parade of men with the constantly flickering features, and that horrible feeling of being trapped makes it fairly clear that what Sandy became what she did as a *reasonable* reaction to what was done to her.",qi2dn4
hikukg1,"I think it's because they mistake her for Sandy? I could be wrong, but the ghost attacks only start happening once Ellie changes her look to be more like Sandy.",qi2dn4

Like, at that point, she's been poisoned, her boyfriend's been stabbed in front of her eyes, the house is on fire, and we've just watched an interminable staircase ""chase"" scene. Plus, all the uncertainty that made earlier scenes with the ghost-men scary is gone: we know who they are and why they're there by now. We know what happened to Sandy. We know what happened to Jack.

Was it supposed to be when she sat there accepting her fate? And I guess i’m confused how so many men could have died and no one running that prostitution ring not caught on or stepped in to either kill her or remove her from their clients? So, like, then.. why did she keep accepting Johns?

No, it’s not a mundane event, but all subsequent actions would have surrounded the fact this girl raise scissors at her classmate during a mental break that wouldn’t ever been seen again - thus she was never a danger again",qi2dn4
hiqxqpl,"Honestly. The tourment she goes through throughout the show and the damage she causes on the individuals that surround her is in no way counterbalanced. Her actions did not have the consequences they deserved. Better to not have the scene at all than putting the scene in. Saying it's just ""CinemaSins"" attitude is ignoring the simple fact that actions have consequences and if you show the action, you should show the consequences. I loved the movie but women who go through PTSD-inducing events often cause damage, and the fact that there is no legal repercussions, that John does not stop trying to save her even when reason would say otherwise, and the ending is absolutely High School Musical perfectesque, is a bit frustrating considering the extreme seriousness of the rest of the movie.",qi2dn4

There's certainly parts that could've been tightened up script wise",qi2dn4

-Her grandma was present and her friend who was gut stabbed and inhaled a ton of smoke was there for her congratulating her.

hmhhx51,"But you would be reading into something that we were never given. You can say she was crazy like her mom, or you could say that her mom saw ghosts as well and couldnt deal with them.

hirdw02,"The same film as you. Your point would have made perfect sense if they didn’t spend five minutes trying to turn Sandie into a psychopath trying to hunt Eloise (a nice dose of victim blaming) before she has a magic change of heart to muddle the entire message. As for Eloise, her arc was designed to make her as emotional and erratic as possible going so far as to blame an innocent man; which in and of itself was a pretty obvious stab at #metoo.

Let’s not even get started on the loose threads left behind by the time the credits role. Regardless, if you enjoyed it. Film is subjective, and in my opinion, this was Wright’s biggest letdown by a mile.

I’m willing to bet that had a young indie filmmaker made this instead of a genius like Wright, that mine would be the overwhelming opinion. The film was a tonal/narrative disaster.",qi2dn4

I even guessed that he must be the cop.

iob1gsc,"I know I’m super late but I had the exact same impression initially! I didn’t read anything about the premise before starting the movie, so I didn’t know it was meant to have “real” ghosts and time travel. I almost liked it more when I believed she was descending into madness because it felt like a compelling depiction of schizophrenic delusions and hallucinations, maybe precipitated by the new hostile environment she moved to. 
When I realized it was a supernatural movie I was still happy though. The entire movie was so well cast and I thought it depicted assault and sexual abuse/exploitation in a much more empathetic way than I usually see in movies. I’m surprised this movie didn’t get more attention/praise because while the ending was a little cheesy, I thought all the main actors gave very strong performances and I found the themes moving too.",qi2dn4

hitpm8j,"My take was that she has a gift to see ghosts/spirits somehow.  Before she went to London she was at home with just her and her Gran. We see very early in the movie that she glimpses her mother in the reflection and later on in the movie when on the phone with Gran she is asked if she ""saw her again?"".  So even before the movie kicks off we're to understand that she has some gift (or possible mental illness?) to see spirits/ghosts or something.  It does get pretty muddy the more you think about it but I then took it to be that her moving to London and especially into that apartment meant that she was now around a LOT MORE spirits/ghosts/dead people than her country home and so the gift was now working overtime and she was losing control of it. Again, it gets muddy with how she can then ""travel"" back to the past and see things play out but maybe that could be explained as her gift/power getting even stronger the more she uses and understands it?",qi2dn4

Jack deserved what he got; he was literally trying to kill Sandie. I got the impression that when she killed Jack, something snapped in her and the murders snowballed from there. What turned Sandie into this monster (and killed Sandie, created Alex as the officer says to Eloise) was the night after night after night of trauma and abuse, and then the experience of being nearly killed by your boyfriend/pimp and then having to kill him. You genuinely feel real compassion for Sandie, but you only pity Alexandra. When she turns to the mirror at the very end, sees Sandie, and tells Eloise she never meant for this to happen and to run, I believe that was Sandie talking, not Alexandra.",qi2dn4
hp3029c,"I think how they portray Sandie at the end is what makes the ending good. It is too easy to tell you ""A is evil and B is great"", but that's not how real life works. We saw Sandie as a kind soul that was abused by evil men, which turned her into a broken person who eventually became a serial murderer of these evil people. She's branded forever by her deeds, to the point she's willing to murder innocent people (Ellie and John) to protect herself. She's not a rational person, she lost that when she was pimped by Jack. At the end she realizes she's become a bad person herself, that what she lived through doesn't make her immune to being the baddie too, so she takes the split second decision to die instead and let Ellie and John live.

The movie also puts us in the difficult situation where we have to choose between the assholes that raped Sandie, and Sandie who is a mass murderer and has no problem killing innocent kids.

indhuv7,"I'm WAY late to this discussion and just saw this for the first time last night but THANK YOU, this is a movie that never operates in black and white morality or even in black and white supernatural rules within the plot. This thing is heavily, *heavily* inspired by giallo and those are two hallmarks of that.  And honestly it makes way more sense than a lot of the classics it's borrowing from, but I love how it plays a little loose with the rules of the supernatural elements, it's a great throwback to the Italian horror of the 60's and 70's.

Sandie's character is by far one of the strongest parts of the whole film and what makes it so interesting.  She isn't totally good, she isn't totally evil, she makes decisions that skirt the lines of good and bad and makes mistakes and shows regret. She's a complex character with a lot of depth, and I thought she was written and played brilliantly.

I loved this movie.",qi2dn4

hih8age,"Literally just finished watching it so it's fresh in my head:

The story is about Ellie surviving and dealing with her ""gift"". The Johns weren't good, but also didn't deserve to get murdered.

Obviously at some point she turned down clients  (when Jack is chasing her) and Jack probably took her to new places to get more Johns. She mentions that she hunted them down, so they might not have been Jack's/Sandy's clients anymore, just thought they were getting lucky one last time. She couldn't just stop taking them, other than robbing the corpses, she didn't really have any extra income to survive.

What repercussions can Ellie have? She was innocent in/of everything (other than swinging the scissors at her classmate). The ending was likely  a few months after the main part. She might have been in the hospital for a few days, then maybe therapy, and then she has finally begun to get adjusted, probably assuming/hoping she's lost her ""gift"". Then she sees her mom for the first time since the opening scene and then Sandy is back; though it seems she thinks it's a positive thing.",qi2dn4
hj8c1tz,"It’s shades of grey though right? The whole movie is about how well people remember the glamorous 60s but it turns out stuff back then was just as messed up as it was good. Those Dudes at the whorehouse were bad dirty people but they didn’t deserve to be brutally murdered either. At the same time, sandy wasn’t always evil, she was a good person with dreams, but then she does bad things because of the places she was put and the eventual choices she made in those places. None of the people are all good, and none of the people are all bad. Ellie even has problems and handles things poorly in the effort to try to do good. The only person not fitting the good and bad bill is Ellie’s eventual BF, he was a pretty standup guy throughout it all",qi2dn4

Sandy was sympathetic for sure - taken advantage of, lured into sex trafficking - until we find out she’s a mass serial killer (albeit with revenge on the mind) and attempts to murder the main character. And the men she murdered, we are lead to think of them as the vultures, these faceless men who have destroyed her innocence, until the last scene when we find out they’ve been shoved into floorboards and they’re begging for peace and and for their murderer to be killed. In today’s climate, where sex work is increasingly framed as a person’s choice, it is clear to the viewer that Sandy’s not participating by her choice, but to the men, they are paying presumably thinking sandy is on the other end of a deal, no? Please forgive me if that is an incorrect view of ‘60s prostitution from a “customer’s” perspective as it very well may be, but that was my impression after the movie, and regardless I think the confusion about who is in the right still stands from a cinematic perspective",qi2dn4

And Eloise just really believed the old man was Jack, it's not that deep.

And while I can understand people having an issue with how Wright handled the commentary (it was kinda one-note but it worked for me), I definitely don't think it was his intent to blame victims or deliever an anti-MeToo message, it's pretty crystal clear that the movie is an open condemnation of abuse and exploitation.",qi2dn4

After these episodes people more out less go back to treating her like a sane person. The reality is she probably would have been involuntarily committed long before the climax of the film.

It’s been a while since I watched the movie but from what I remember, the ending just didn’t flow well for me. I saw the story, two-thirds in, as a realistic portrayal on sexism, abuse, and the normalization of both during the 60s. Infused with some fantastical elements that worked well. To me, that was incredibly compelling. 

But Wright trying to infuse horror and the ghost of the johns into the story did nothing for me. It sacrificed the realism. The reality he showed was already terrifying. The horror felt half-hearted and forced. 

I just didn’t like that the way to make Alexandra complex would be to make her a serial killer. Felt like a disservice to this character we were getting to know. 

But to each their own, we all take different things away from movies!",qi2dn4

hj5n24m,"Yes, I felt confused as to how much the film expected us to sympathise and forgive Sandy for being a *serial killer*.  I felt like the film should have spent some more time on showing us how Jack pressurised Sandy into having sex with all those men, and maybe how she was being promised a singing career in exchange, when all we got was her dancing on stage with a face like thunder, and then telling Jack that she doesn't want this, and then Boom, she's a prostitute.  If there was more coercion or threats or bribes at the start, I would have been a lot more sympathetic later.  As it is, I'm left feeling that Sandy was shirking responsibility for her own choices, and I don't think that was how I was supposed to feel.",qi2dn4

Sandie *was* murdered by Jack in a manner of speaking, and I’d bet Alexandria had never set foot in that room since then (hence the bedsit).

Exactly. The murders of rich dickheads who enjoyed abusing vulnerable women, I could understand, but she tried to kill 2 young innocents to save her ass. She has zero excuse for that and for me **it completely remove the whole point/message of the movie.**

Even for the guys she murdered, with how they showed them at the end begging for Eloise to save them and looking afraid, I was starting to think that maybe she invented all this.

And they introduced the cop who was pretty handsome guy, so when they said he was a “ladies man” I started to wonder if that’s what they meant instead of Jack. So the thought was in the back of my head when when the car scene happened. Also, he wasn’t acting like a guy who was worried about being accused of murder. He seemed to cool with Eloise instead of nervous or on edge. Just like a curious old man who sees someone who reminds him of younger days.",qi2dn4

hior3ci,"Right, I thought it was a really cool twist on the classic serial killer/slasher/whodunnit movie. We get to know the character and see what she’s been through, then in the end we find out that she’s a killer. Usually we see the murders, the murderer is revealed and they have to give their motivation in the end. I think some people are confusing her sympathetic motivation (woman forced into prostitution seeks revenge) with the message of the movie. The Johns weren’t good, Sandy wasn’t good, it was just a slasher set in a messy era for women that we’re still dealing with today. Ellie falls prey to sympathizing too much with the killer, but she also never feels bad for the men who victimized Sandy. 

Also I thought it was brilliant how Ellie’s boyfriend was John, Jack (the pimp) is a nickname for John, and Johns are customers of prostitutes. Interesting naming.",qi2dn4

Neither of them are timid, shy and naive.

Its not her voice either. She just comes across as lost, aimless, upset with everyone for no reason, there’s nothing tragic about her. She seems like a 14 year old and she couldn’t carry her weight against a lot of the heavier scenes.",qi2dn4
hioab7c,"I don't disagree with the 6/10 rating but just to your point about the bodies smelling there was a bit of foreshadowing in the beginning when Sandy told Ellie that ""it won't matter until the summer but when it gets hot you'll want to plug up the holes to stop the smell"" and that there was an almost intentional overuse of garlic next door that she'd eventually only ever smell garlic",qi2dn4

I stand by my opinion",qi2dn4

I feel so sorry for what Sandy went through, but again murder went over the line",qi2dn4
hiosldp,"She flips when Ellie hugs her. She tries to kill herself after realizing she’ll go to jail, but Ellie shows her that she understands her struggles. Hell, the whole movie was about understanding others’ trauma. The girls at the beginning one-upping about their moms dying, the policewoman offering therapy or support to Ellie, there was an undercurrent of messages about being more open about mental health and trauma. By hugging Sandy, Ellie is empathizing, although not endorsing (obviously since Sandy just attacked her and John).",qi2dn4
hikz6cb,Did you not see where she seems to notice the ghosts of the men she has killed or at least thinks about them while saying she didn't want to end up like this.

hilke2q,"It also added to her own sense of ""am I even really seeing these things?""

I think the movie plays the possible mental health angle fairly well, without going overboard. Its a concern of her gran's from the beginning, it may very well be what led to her mom's suicide, and then the cops suggest a family history, which Ellie reacts to pretty strongly.

I'm glad it *wasn't* that, and still think more could have been done with Jocasta, but the whole situation was definitely set up to make a mental health crisis a legitimate possibility.",qi2dn4

Some people are just more sympathetic/empathetic by nature. I can see both the feeling that Ellie should be less empathetic towards Sandie after the murder attempt(s), and the feeling that Ellie just ""lived"" through Sandie's trauma(s), better enabling her to *deeply* understand how Sandie got so broken.

Life breaks a lot of us, some more than others. Sometimes life leads people down paths where they do terrible things. It didn't need to be that way, though, and it could just as easily have happened to you or I. Most people hope that we're doing the right things, and that if we're not, that people will understand and have empathy for us. Only seems right to try to have empathy and love for others, even when they do terrible things. (Which is not to say it excuses or absolves people for their actions, or that people shouldn't protect themselves.)",qi2dn4

Eloise showing up earnestly in her own creations is challenging for Jocastas inferiority complex, and it makes her a target because by wearing her own designs she's seen as believing her handmade clothes are good enough to be seen; I'm not sure if you have much experience with the uk class system but by doing this Eloise is a working class girl acting ""above her station in life"".",qi2dn4

hiqekx9,"Four times if you include the two week early screening I was able to get into when Edgar was in Brooklyn. 


The reason I'm going so often is to introduce as many people as I can to this film and to help increase the ticket sales in whatever little way I can. 

When I was looking at AMC's developer API I discovered that they have an internal ""score"" that predicts how they think a film will do against other films that are playing and coming soon. [Last night in soho did not do well](https://i.imgur.com/VLig0yU.png). 

This also lines up with with some analysts predicting poor box office. 

I understand how this film has been stuck in your head. The subsequent watches slightly disappointed me in that the surprises were gone but the emotion at the ending was still jarring despite knowing what was going to happen. I can say it is still true after the fourth watching. Taylor-Joy's singing when Sandy is walking up the stairs to kill Eloise is spine tingling. That whole scene is burned into my head. It feels like soothing Ice Cream after a long dinner. 

Once this film finishes its week long run, everyone will have moved on and that feels really sad. I missed the whole press tour for Scott Pilgrim and Baby Driver because I did not know Edgar Wright. This is the first film I have followed from filming on to the delays and now the final release and it feels sad that it will all be pretty much be over in a few days never to be discussed that much again.",qi2dn4

hj6l2ek,"It doesn't ruin the point/message of the movie, because the point/message of the movie wasn't a moral one. The point of it was not ""murder is bad"" or ""it's okay to kill people when you're being victimized"".

The point was that Sandy was manipulated into a cage and she was a victim, but she turned that into brutalizing others. It was in character for her to try and kill the two kids at the end. She'd felt trapped her entire life, and she was refusing to be caught now. Sandy felt as if she'd freed herself, and she killed before for what she viewed as her ""freedom"", why not do it again?

I also think that if we look past Sandy's attractive qualities (her beauty, her confidence, the fact that she's a stunning blonde) you can also see the qualities that lead to her becoming a killer. She's self absorbed, constantly watching herself in the mirror. She has an edge to her in the beginning that the audience chooses to overlook in the same way Ellie chooses to overlook because of how badly she wants to keep this romanticized ideal of the 60s in her mind.

So much about this film is about letting go of the beauty and the idealized version of the past, but also the idealized version of Sandy that it presents to you too. I think audiences want the innocent, pretty blonde who righteously murders men who deserve it, not the reality of what she was doing and the fact that at some point, she gained a taste for it.",qi2dn4

Since this was in Vegas, a lot of her Johns were some high profile, A-list Hollywood celebrities. I’m not gonna name names, but one person she named is a best actor Oscar Winner. I HIGHLY doubt that this person knew she was being forced against her will, and if he did, he wouldn’t have gone through with sleeping with her (at least, I hope not).

He could’ve easily passed the Bechdel Test with LNiS. 

The scissors thing…someone shouts “call the cops.” Jacosta already loathes and maybe even envies Ellie, so I’d assume she’s follow through. Also, she’s a person who was nearly murdered, and others saw it too. The cops are going to check on that. And the way John stops her is just so overly complicated.

Literally every shot in that sequence, and even a bunch of shots in the interrogation scene (when the cop asks if she’d been drugged) are explicitly there to make us realize she was drugged at the club. 


They don’t just show up on a set and shoot random shit — you realize they plan what they show on screen, right?

hj2ni0c,Yeah one of the headline says teacher. I don't think a teacher is in the same league of the first important show business guy. It's not clear at all.,qi2dn4
hilyp7d,Sandy did see the ghosts though. She reacted to them and Jack actually slapped her and said “you wanted this.” She reacted to the slap and actually responds with “I didn’t want this” or something along those lines.,qi2dn4
hj5txu2,"idk if it's because I was simping hard over ATJ and developed tolerance for the whole film but I didn't think it was any exceptionally woke. 

a reserved and naive girl out of her comfort zone trope is not new at all. red herring and a serial killer reveal are also not. inexperienced and reserved ellie would lose her shit, and she did, if she could see what sandy went through. sandy's arc was understandable as well. 

I'm not ignoring the glaring theme of 'sex? bad! men? evil!', but I can accept that we're seeing this story through ellie's eyes",qi2dn4

hmjxbd5,"Johnnies! I was born in Brittany, western part of France. In the area around Roscoff, there's a lot of farmers growing mostly red onions, garlic, scallots. A while ago, they used to take the ferry to England with only their bikes and tons of onions and stuff wrapped around them and their bikes. They'd stay there a bit to sell their products, and then come back.  Since most of them were called ""Jean"", these guys were called ""Johnnies"" in England. I wouldn't be surprised that's where that old stereotype comes from!",qi2dn4

You seem nice.",qi2dn4

hmj7wwg,"Obviously the implication is there, but just like her family's history of mental illness, it is there to make the police (and us) question if she is of sound mind and if she is actually seeing the past.

Can you explain to me why she had the vision in the club (because she was intoxicated/drugged) and then seemingly sobered up outside with John, then somehow got drugged again as she was about to have sex? Was that like, a roofie hangover or something?",qi2dn4

hlvhnc0,"That scene ends with John chasing after Jocasta, I thought it was going to show him explaining there is something wrong with Ellie and she needs help, and that would lead into a redemption arc for her. Maybe it's a deleted scene, or was cut in the writing room.

I really loved this movie, but there seems to be something little part missing. Jocasta is set up as an antagonist but doesn't develop into anything, there's this mental health angle that ultimately isn't impactful to what's happening.",qi2dn4
hklh3or,That makes more sense now,qi2dn4
hmbi825,"I think it's directly tied to how Sandy experienced those moments. The hickey was from a passionate romantic moment, so she was fully into that. Everything after, was disassociating, trying to make it not feel real, all while the trauma of what she went through was still felt (the ghosts grabbing Ellie being an echo of that). And then her 'murder' was, you know, her killing herself as much as she killed him. It changed her forever.",qi2dn4
ho5ne46,That's so impressive!,qi2dn4
hoftjyg,To everyone else she seems like a woman with some severe mental health issues. Maybe he has some savior complex things going on but I think for most people open eye hallucinations that result in attempted murder would be the line in the Sand for continuing your crush.,qi2dn4

hj8m8ra,"I don't know what the filmmakers had in mind, and the themes are definitely timely, but they're also a tale as old as time. 

This is the exact kind of scenario that leads a lot of women to prostitution. They meet a guy, they date the guy, he slowly starts pressuring her to do things she's not necessarily comfortable with but she does it because he loves her and says it's alright. Then he introduces other people into the equation, he orchestrates a scenario where she sleeps with someone else, then again and again until this is just her life and she doesn't know what happened. The guy morphs from boyfriend to pimp. 

It didn't make me think of Harvey Weinstein or the ""casting couch,"" which is also a tale as old as time.

I thought it was great the movie portrayed this kind of relationship, and had the protagonist identify it as bad pretty early on.",qi2dn4
hixkjb2,Hahaha I know right,qi2dn4
hiqgyuj,They were both excellent as well!,qi2dn4
hjikrys,"Actually you make a good point. Eloise is what, 18/19?

Let's just say she was born in the year 2000.

Her mother died when she was 7, she tells her roommate towards the start. This would mean 2007. The mother looks to be around mid to late 30s when her image appears in the mirror. So let's say she died at 37. It would mean she was born in 1970.

This means the mother would have come of age in the 80s. It was the grandma who got to experience the swinging 60s firsthand.

So is the idea that the mother herself grew up with nostalgia for the 60s and Eloise is replicating that nostalgia? Was the mother driven to suicide because of her own experiences in London, perhaps similarly trying to make it in fashion and recreate the 60s era?

This would explain the grandma's concerns that Eloise would go down the same path. 

But, again, the contemporary setting is a bit implausible. It's super expensive to live so centrally and take cabs all the time lol. Plus fashion students would not be partying in Soho, they'd be out in Hackney Wick, Dalston, Peckham or Tottenham.",qi2dn4
hj8q9jn,"I had so many theories whole watching this movie and one of them was that the landlady was a ghost and Ellie was accidentally squatting in an abandoned building, having a prolonged psychotic break, not actually paying anyone anything.

Even the instant job at the pub seemed fake and I thought maybe she was imagining that too. 

At the beginning, there was no indication that I picked up on of the time period. When she whipped out the smartphone, I was like oh wow, it's present day! Setting it back a bit might have helped with the believability.",qi2dn4
hii2xif,"Yep, I had avoided it for a while until it played in front of a movie I went to see. Such an awful trailer.",qi2dn4
hj8csr5,"You can see the reflections of all the ghosts in old sandys glasses!! It’s clear that in that moment sandy was experiencing the same thing Ellie was in terms of the ghosts. Does that follow the logic of the rest of the movie? No, but it makes sense for the murderer of these dozens of men, who just walked into the room with all these ghosts who were actively trying to influence Ellie to act, would feel and see something, thus causing another crossover between reality and spirit world. Hell, now that I think about it, her getting the hickey proves early on that these worlds Ellie perceives can cross over physically. That’s why Jack can slap her!",qi2dn4
hind3ac,"Bingo, thanks I forgot exactly what happened but even if you don't think she actually saw them exactly like Ellie could she's obviously thinking about the bodies in the walls and floors burning and trying to save someone who was about to kill you and stabbed your friend is a valiant act that shows what type of person you are.",qi2dn4

hjvyq5l,"Yeah, but there's no storytelling involved with your change.  Walking down a street is not a story and doesnt offer character development.

We know from the beginning she wants to go to fashion school, and it makes sense she'd use the dorms offered by the school.  Having her need to find a new room builds up her stance that she doesn't quite belong in the modern world and feels more connected to a different era.  She is finally able to find her perfect fit with the apartment she wants, but slowly she starts to realize there's a dark side to everything.

That's storytelling.  Walking down the street is not",qi2dn4

hmzji3y,"I found it a very sad film because she never got the help she needed, no one at her school thought to ask to help her even though she was clearly hallucinating and running out of class screaming on multiple occasions, the narrative and her grandmother pushed mental illness, saying on multiple occasions that her mum was mentally ill, killed herself because of her illness, asking Ellie if she still had ""issues"" and if she was still hallucinating her mother. Sounds like she had schizophrenia for some time before she went to London. I think its framed in a is it real or not way to make it a horror. I think the real horror is mental illness is often ignored by society.",qi2dn4

hmzmtjb,"Many horror movies utilize that ""mental illness/trauma/grief is the *real* horror"" type twist, which can be effective.

hoft8gj,That explains your whole thread,qi2dn4
hj8jpah,Yes there are ghosts and visions. If they weren’t visions then the main girl would have been walking around London breaking into to places so she could see ghost reenact their past. Basically a mark was left on that room and she was seeing what happened. This has been done in many many ghost movies. She saw the cop in the vision and he wasn’t dead yet so obviously it’s a vision events. Only real ghosts we see are the faceless men that attack her.,qi2dn4

I took it as the lead character seeing “ghosts” of the past. Maybe not the super literal ghosts of something like the Conjuring, but more like energies from the past that were left behind from extreme emotions like trauma.",qi2dn4

honupm6,"The phrase red herring in film became popularized by Alfred Hitchcock, although it technically predates his work. It refers to false leads in thriller/mystery films/stories and has been largely adapted to the thriller genre in film. 

There are red herrings in this film, absolutely, but they have nothing to do with the fact that her roommate drugged her at the club, and that you have no idea what you’re talking about. 


Red herrings are always related to the plot in some way, as they are what’s called a “plot device.”
