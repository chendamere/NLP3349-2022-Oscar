I was really hoping the final evolved deviant would help fight Ikaris because the deviant (who is now intelligent) and the other Eternals have the same goal now - to stop the Celestial from being born.

As it stands they 'reveal' the true intentions of the Eternal's mission pretty early into the movie. All the characters are only focused on stopping the Celestial until a Deviant comes along for an action scene.


The super-Deviant or whatever absorbs three characters and is dispatched single-handedly by Angelina Jolie in the middle of the much more important Emergence! What if the Deviants started working with the Eternals instead of just SAYING that both groups were the same, pawns in the game? (they both wanted Earth to survive after all) What more could we have learned about the Eternals if they didn't have to waste all that time explaining the (ultimately inconsequential) Deviant threat?


Maybe Marvel thought that introducing Eternals without Deviants would be like making a Venom movie without Spider-Man. But I feel like instead of half-baking three groups this could have focused on making me care about the most important two.",qn0q4y

The Evolved Deviant could have been something cool.  Maybe the first time in the MCU that the villain is actually right, and convinces the good guys to join him in stopping the Celestial?  He just wants to live, and Eternals have just been raising people for the slaughter this whole time.

Nope, just chop him up, the end.

It was so pointless and anticlimactic it shouldn't have been in the movie at all.

They could have, I dunno, just had Ajak summon everyone together for a meeting because she intended to let people know the truth, and that the emergence is happening.

Some show up, some don't.  Either way when they get there Ajak is already dead.

Now it's a murder mystery!  The rest of the film can more or less play out similarly but without the CGI fights.  Trying to figure out what happened to Ajak, maybe they suspect a Deviant, but nobody knows for sure.  Sersi still trying to figure out how to communicate with Arishem.

And Ikaris is there the whole time trying to steer them away from the truth and sabotage everything, maybe Sprite as well faking things and throwing everyone else off course.  Ikaris could have killed Gilgamesh instead, maybe trying to set Thena off and kill the rest of them.  That would have been a hell of a turning point in the movie.",qn0q4y

Bill Skarsgard as Kro, the big bad deviant, didn't have much to work with. I think we should've had more scenes with him.

A film that spans space and time as much as Eternals is full of things to talk about. The voice and design of the celestial was wonderful.

hjxont4,"The movie is not bad. And it is certainly not as bad as the initial critical reception would have you believe.

That being said, there are some obvious shortcomings that make the movie less than it could be. The reviews of the critics are not unjustified.

I'll try outline my issues with the film here:

* The foremost problem, I think, is that it tried to do too much. It crammed in too many characters, subplots, and villains. I also think it had one love triangle too many. The rest of the issues in the movie subsequently flows from this initial problem.
* The movie is thematically unfocused. There's a lot of good ideas, no doubt. How do the Eternals wrestle with the beauty and ugliness of humanity, as well as find their own humanity in the face of their eternity? Is it ethical to save lives at the cost of other potential lives? The Eternals also had potential as a family drama, where their bond as a family is at risk of breaking because of their own individual beliefs (which is very contemporary considering today's highly politicised world). The problem is that these ideas are not given enough space to mature. They are left underdeveloped. Maybe focusing fully on one theme would have done much more for thematic consistency, instead of cramming everything in, yet leaving us wanting.
* It's tonally inconsistent. It tries at points to be deep and high concept and mature, maybe in an attempt to be unlike other films in the MCU (I think we see this in the more slower parts of the movie, which I really liked), but then snaps back into the MCU formula of jokes, and action set pieces. One that I found quite distasteful was when Druig hits Sprite with a rock. Here you have one of the Eternals pouring their heart out about their longing for humanity, which I assume to be a key theme, and...it gets played off as a joke. Talk about a slap in the face.
* The Deviant subplot felt undercooked and underwhelming. It feels to me their inclusion was more for action sequences, and not much else. From pretty early on we know they have to stop Tiamut, but then they show up and we get some cool fighting, and not much else. I get you need them for the Ikaris reveal, I just think it was poorly done.
* A continuation from the previous point, the whole Thena revenge subplot felt so underwhelming. Mainly because it was done at the same time when the other eternals were fighting Ikaris. When she killed him I was like ""Okay, cool, but the far more pressing and frankly more interesting fight is going on outside, and I want to see that more.” The fight just seemed irrelevant come the climax. Its too secondary and too rushed. I think this is the clearest example of the consequences of doing too much.
* Gilgamesh died for nothing. I must preface that I was a huge fan of the MCU casting Ma Dong-Seok, and I really enjoyed his character in the limited minutes he was on screen. So when he died (and also after realising that he died for an underdeveloped subplot), I felt that it was a waste of a talented actor, and I became sour to the MAX (same applies to Salma Hayek). I'm fine with deaths to characters, it makes things less predictable which is a good thing. It just has to be well executed and satisfying. I don't think Gilgamesh's was, and that his death did not serve much of a purpose.
* A lot of things happen on screen, but at times there is no emotional weight or 'feeling' that comes out of it. What we get is a movie that is emotionally neither here nor there. This does not happen all the time, there are some points of the movie where I am genuinely moved, such as the climax scene with Ikaris and Sersi.
* \- Using Hiroshima for pathos... I don't know how comfortable I am with that.

Those were my main issues with the film. This is not to say that there weren't things that I enjoyed. I’ll go through them here:

* Much has been said about the cast and their chemistry (or lack thereof). I personally like the cast, and felt their chemistry to be satisfactory. (I personally have a tendency to fill in the gaps of emotion myself. If you put a group together and tell me they're the best of mates, I'll usually buy it, so I'm not the best person to ask about how emotionally engaging/interesting a cast's performance is). So while I can understand why some people did not buy the Ikaris/Sersi relationship, I did.
* Makkari is the best on screen speedster I've ever seen. No slow motion whatsoever. You're seeing everything she does in real time, and it's SO COOL. The fight against Ikaris was probably the best action sequence in the whole movie, and was giving me mad Invincible episode 1 vibes.
* Druig and Makkari also had great chemistry.
* While the comedy can feel a bit forced at times (an MCU trait that they maybe could have done without), Harish Patel as Karun was a highlight.
* Some people felt that the slower moments in the film were bad, but I really enjoyed them. I like when characters are given space to breathe, and when we can focus simply on character interactions. These are also the points where things were more philosophical and high concept, which I enjoyed. Now, if these interactions and discussions made sense or were beneficial to the overall experience is a different story. When looking at things from the sum of its parts, I guess I like the parts more than the sum.
* Some people also did not like the exposition and information dump. I actually really enjoyed the cosmic scale of the exposition, so I didn't mind it at all. I'm also a fan of Marvel in general, so I can understand why others who are not so invested in the universe building were not so fond of it.
* Personally I dig the inclusion. You don't have to have different ethnicities, so it's nice when they are there. Having Lauren Ridloff as Makkari, and all the eternals signing was heartwarming, and hopefully does much for people with lived experience of disability.
* The allusions of ancient near Eastern creation myths, Graeco-Roman mythology, and the clear Harken to Genesis at the opening. \*chefs kiss\*. I'm a huge Biblical studies fan, so seeing those allusions, and seeing how Marvel repurposed them was so cool to me.

I can't comment on cinematography, because my experience was far too dark. I've heard others say it's good, and others bad, so I guess I'll have to wait for a better viewing experience. I did think some of the shots were beautiful though.

**Another point of discussion.**

I've heard people say that this particular plot for Eternals should have been done as a series, and I agree.

It would solve much of the pacing problems, as well as give some more time to the underdeveloped themes. Serieses have much more potential of being multi-thematic, while movies need to be more focused. This way, we can be led along the problem of the deviants, have more time to engage and form emotional bonds with the main characters, have a satisfying Ikaris reveal, have Thena's revenge subplot, and a proper climax.

It also solves the problem of unsatisfying and unpurposeful deaths. Gilgamesh dying at the end of episode 4 of a 7 episode series is better for his character, than him dying an hour into a 2 hour movie.

While I know this might not be commercially viable, the fact that some of us feel that the Eternals is a mini-series crammed into a 2 hour movie should be a testament to how the movie was flawed in the first place.

**Rating:**

While I can tune out and just enjoy the movie as a spectacle with some comedy and cool action scenes, when I evaluate it critically, I can't see past the lack of thematic focus, the tonal unevenness, and poor pacing.

hjo5f57,"I feel like this could have been a decent sequel to an Eternals movie which solely focused on them and the tensions among them; them fighting the Deviants through time and helping humanity with their powers, ending with them going their separate ways. 



I always thought that anything related to the Dreaming Celestial would be too-much-too-soon for a debut movie, this should have been a great twist like Hydra controlling the SHIELD in CA:TWS which would have really sucked if they crammed that in CA:TFA. Two movies worth of stuff was crammed up in one, so much so that midway into the movie, I realised that I didn't give a shit about any of the characters because the movie was more focused on telling us about them through exposition instead of making us feel for any of them.  



I'm debating with myself if this belongs to the lowest tier of MCU movies or not. I cant find a single memorable scene from a 2 and a half hour movie while I find good scenes in even the worst MCU films namely: the fighting through portals in Thor 2, the racetrack suitup scene in IM2, the Stark house attack and final 3rd of IM3. This kinda belongs to BW and CM (I realised that Antman and the Wasp also was a thing which was so forgettable I even forgot about how bad it was and I'm adding it here) territory where you have no idea what happened and just watched through it to get to the next point. A generous 5.5/10.

But Thanos was a universal threat, he didn't wipe out half of the Earth population, he wiped out half of the whole universe. I don't see how that would break the cycle of life and death the Celestials talked about.

Madden, for all that I know he can do, was made of cardboard the entire time.  

Overall, I'd probably agree with the critical review average of 6/10.  It'll be sitting right next to Dark World for me as a watchable but uninteresting showing.",qn0q4y
hjdu957,Thena wielding Excalibur was bad ass. Cool call forward to Black Knight,qn0q4y
hjn08bn,"One of my issues with this movie was tone. The scene where they meet up with Gilgamesh and Thena in Australia and tell Gilgamesh the Ajak dead...and literally at the same moment they pull a gag with the pie falling apart. Then immediately jump to Thena in some kind of mental break. Am I supposed to feel for Gilgamesh losing his leader and friend, or am I laughing, or am I concerned?

When the end of world is at stake in every movie, it's hard to convince me to care, so you have to make the audience care about something else. Usually the replacement is the characters dying, but I wasn't given anything to care about because they had very similar personalities and their relationships were confusing. Are they like siblings or are they trying to bone each other? Why is it impossible for Ikaris to be in a scene with a woman and not be sexual? Why do Eternal beings even deal with human things like gender, eating, kissing, sex...wouldn't they be more 'evolved' than that? Do they actually care about humans, because we rarely see them interact with humans unless it's manipulating them. It's confusing all around.",qn0q4y

hje6kh3,"It's a coinn flip with this one for me.

I loved the characters and their struggles, you feel empathy for them and all of them feel unique. Druig was my favorite. Movie asks some thought provoking questions and has deep themes. I loved the struggle of Ikaris. Was also shot beautifully. 

I hated the pacing especially in the first 2 acts which felt like an eternity, assembling the Eternals took WAY TOO long. Jumping time ages was so messy, it felt so disorganized. Deviants were a plot device and a bad one. The ultimate Deviants decision to go vs Eternals after he kills Gilgamesh made no sense imo, I thought it was logical of him to join them. Also some other character decisions were just stupid like Kingo peacing out.

All in all the movie has great characters and is beautiful too look at but it's pacing draggs it down and it's a mess. I don't think general audience will like this one.",qn0q4y
hjughyf,"It was just sooo boring, imo. Not bad per se, just flat out insanely booooring and already so long that it really felt like ETERNAL time. I didnt fancy the writing much either, which is a shame, cause there were things that could have been explored deeply and turn it quickly into something much more interesting.

1. Why was the main mission kept a secret from everyone? I mean, before being sent to earth they did not empathize at all with humans... It either wouldn't have led to the movie conflict, or the conflict would atleast have some development...

hjuves0,"Dispite a lot of mixed reviews, I actually like this movie overall.

I was getting real tire of the same repetitive and safe formula that Marvel has been using as a template but Eternals (and Shang-Chi for the most part) are trying something different and taking risks which is quite refreshing. 

Was this movie perfect? No. Was it a bit too long? Yes. 

But overall Eternals (and Shang-Chi) got me hooked  and back on with the Mcu after I said I was done with it. 

Hopefully the next phase of movies will continue to try and be different from the template that the MCU has been using for the last few years.

Overall I give it a solid 8/10.",qn0q4y
hodonrl,"I have a theory I'd like fans of the MCU tell me if its possible. But before I need to get some things off my chest.  


   If you need too much text on screen for people to understand your movie, you are doing something wrong. We even needed Kingo to tell us Sprite was in love with Ikarus, because there seems to be no relationship between those characters what so ever.  
   The main characters have to be shown in the first 20min of the movie. It's a law in Cinema. Why is it that an actor so relevant as Kit Harrington is shown so early when it has no role in the movie. Why start in 6000BC, then go to the present, then go back to Babilon? Just Jump from 6000BC to Babilon. Introduce all main characters and their personalities, their reason for their split. AND THEN, go to the present and introduce Black Knight.  
   What is the point to present a love relationship between Sersei and Black Knight, if throughout the whole movie, screams unresolved issues from both Ikarus and Sersei (Sersei, showing no remorse for holding ikarus's hand when being in a relationship with Kit). Black Knight is not part of the movie, there is no love triangle, no conflict of interest if you don't give the third wheel a chance to participate on the drama. Seems to me like waste of internal conflict.  
   Too much text. On every ellipse there is a ""1500AC"" or ""PRESENT DAY"". We can tell the difference. It is pretty obvious, you don't need to hold our hands. Let the viewer use their reason.   
The plot of the movie is centered on us reacting to the characters reaction on Ajak's death. And even that first scene where they find Ajak is a HUGE spoiler. Ikarus arrives to the scene with barely looking at Ajak and says ""It was a deviant"", like, no shit! It's unnecessary and it screams ""IT WAS ME!"".  
  The reasons they gave for making our world worth saving and not the other hundreds of worlds they harvested is cringe.  
  Ikarus death on the sun is not ironic, it's cringe.  
  The scene where Ikarus says to Sprite ""I am glad you are here"" when they didn't speak to each other in the whole movie, is Cringe.  
  I am cringe for complaining this much.  


TL;DR: Movie sucks.  


Theory:

In the post credit scene, Pip introduces Eros, an eternal from Titan. Could it be that Titan did not get extinct from an internal conflict regarding resources? But a Celestial's birth destroyed Titan. And Thanos all along wanted delay the creation of celestials by cutting all life by half? Making Thanos, a some kind of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagaan kind of villain. And if so, a Tolkien's Eagles dilema is born. If with all 6 stones you can whipe half of the life. Why not just whipe the celestials?",qn0q4y

hjij6qv,"I feel pretty confused since they were pretty clear that the eternals are machines, but here we have eros claiming to be an eternal and brother of thanos, who im pretty damn sure is biological? 

So on the actual movie front i felt like it started too mehly. I didnt get remotely interested until about 30-40 mins in. It just felt incredibly boring. I am super curious on how the Celestials created these beings to kill deviants yea? so why wouldnt they just give them all super combat powers like Ikarus and Thena and Phastos? What the point of making a mind controller when they arent supposed to step in? Also the entire point of having them be robots is so they dont evolve like the deviants right? but then like... Sersis power apparently evolves?

hjd5is8,"Firstly, this is the best looking MCU movie in ages. Probably ever, really, in their catalog. It's amazing how noticeably different (*better*) it is for them to film on locations with natural lighting compared to their traditional method of green screens on a set.

Also, I like the allegory of the characters. Ikarus/Icarus. Ajak/Ajax. Sersi/Circe. Makkari/Mercury. Thena/Athena. All their abilities are related to their mythological counterparts. Which is fitting as this is probably where yee olde people got the ideas to mythologize.

That said. This movie *tries* to be different, but then the MCU formula reins it in. Instead of committing they tried to waffle back and forth to have both. Unfortunately falling flat because of it. 

The other big problem is that this tries to be an Avengers type of payoff without any of the build-up earning that payoff. Way too many characters that we don't know or care about. They try to make up for this by making the movie 2 1/2 damn hours but it didn't work. 

I did like that it wasn't just Eternals (*angels*) Good / Deviants (*demons*) Bad. It was more morally nuanced than that. Had a bad feeling it might had been but pleasantly surprised. 

Overall I thought it was disappointing, but also it's not *bad.* It's entertaining-ish. It's both rushed and at times a slog. And sadly a missed opportunity. 

Side note: Kit Harrington. When he said he loved Sersi I just chuckled. I can't help but wonder what he thought when he read the script and saw that line.",qn0q4y
hjd9rj0,So I knew about the reviews going into this. And the whole time I was waiting for the movie to lose me... but it never did? I just kept enjoying it the whole time.,qn0q4y
hjimstu,I feel like this movie suffered from the same thing Justice League suffered from when it first came out. Too many characters and too much story in too little time (despite it being THREE HOURS LONG). Like you can't pack that many new characters into one origin story film and expect me to become emotionally invested in who they are or what they're fighting for by the end.,qn0q4y
hjisf4b,"Angelina Jolie needed more lines or at least more of a lead role. She’s a great actress…

The whole Kit Harrington being the black knight is way to convenient. These movies are getting crowded with too many superheroes. Unless you keep up with the 20 series on Disney+ and movies you’ll get lost.",qn0q4y
hjnliiy,"After reading reviews I was expecting the movie to be just a middling Marvel origin movie. The way they talked about Zhao being hamstrung by the Marvel formula made it seem that way. But in the end this is the least Marvel like movie of them all and it is both worse and better for it. It was alright, it's a movie where I respect and enjoy what it tried to do, but it missed so much that I think it's definitely in the middle to lower end of Marvel movies for me. 

I'll get what I like out of the way, the visuals in every aspect are fantastic. The more natural lighting mixed with CGI looks fantastic and the vis dev is top notch with everything feeling cohesive but very unique to the Eternals (The Celestials scale and design are insane). A lot of the action is really good too, having a lot of weight and umphhh showcasing how powerful some of them are, but that also contrast the moments where it gets sort of generic more easily. The characters for the most part are interesting, but so many got the short end of the stick where I want to know more about them but there just was no time so they're either rushed or forgotten. Overall this also has big implications as to the scale of the MCU now which is both exciting and worrisome since bigger doesn't always mean better.

In terms of the bad, I think the editing is all over the place, some of the places they chose to cut scenes or string plot points together was SUPER jarring. Which led to some very weird and off feeling dialogue as well. I'm not talking about the traditional Marvel quip heavy stuff either, that is Marvels thing you either like it or you don't at this point. Here there was so much self serious dialogue that just sort of lingered as if it was supposed to be this deep emotional thing, but ended up being just awkward. 



The biggest miss is the villains imo, they had 2 compelling villains that either one could have made an interesting antagonist. Instead they don't commit to either and they both suffer because of it. The Deviant gaining cognition and the memories of Ajak could have been fantastic. A species made by the same creator as the Eternals who was abandoned and then exterminated by his new creation could have been a sympathetic plot point and made the Deviants more than just CGI monsters. But the Deviant learns to talk, hints at this story element and then just disappears till the end to awkwardly show up and do nothing but distract Thena. Ikaris on his own could have been good too, the blindly loyal soldier who has to betray his family to do what he feels is right. The standoff in the ship was a really cool scene where we get all the Eternals actually contemplating what they should do and a number of them disagree and don't want to stop the ending. But that's all in the last 3rd of the movie and we've spent all this time with the Deviants who have done nothing interesting besides 2 lines of dialogue before disappearing.

It feels like something was changed where having both could have made more sense. It's as if the Deviant evolving was supposed to be the plot device that revealed the real threats of Arishems mission and Ikaris's betrayal. Instead, we learn about Arishem way earlier in a much less interesting ""vision"" and Ikaris is revealed by himself a few minutes before the final battle. 

It was alright, but it also feels like the movie as a whole is of the quality of phase 1 or 2 Marvel where they hadn't quite nailed what they wanted so some of the aspects aren't as good as they could have been. At the very least, it will lead to some very interesting implications for the rest of the MCU, and holy shit are the Celestials scary and that scene at the end where Arishem shows up might be the most terrifying thing in the MCU.",qn0q4y
hmk808k,"Visuals, comedy, and acting were good. But that plot was terrible, ignoring the bad physics, they practically screamed Arishem is the bad guy from the beginning so there was zero twist. How the fuck is sprite over 7000 years old yet still acts like a 16 year old girl. And to top it all off they are all robots so they were designed to be flawed. Was Arishem just high as balls making emotionally stunted and deaf robots cause he thought it would be funny? Then lie to them about there origins, cause nothing could possibly go wrong with that..

hjdr5gc,"Okay. To get the important part out of the way I DIDN'T hate it. Wasn't even sure I was going to watch it, but after life this week I needed something to take my mind off things, and a Marvel movie was the perfect thing to do it for a bit. Anyway, initial thoughts:

1) This movie flowed and felt very much like a book. I can't put my finger on exactly why, but the pacing, choice of chronology, emphasis on character building, etc really made this feel more like a visual novel than a movie. Being an avid reader I liked it, but not sure how that would go over with the average movie-goer. Did anyone else have this feeling while watching?

2) Overall the acting wasn't excellent, but it wasn't horrible either. Fairly middle of the road for me personally

3) LOVED some of the effects in this movie. Maybe it's because I chose to drop the money for 3-D this time around, but damn it had its gorgeous moments.

4) Feel like the Absorbo Deviant subplot was pretty...pointless? Maybe that's just me? I mean I get why it was in the story to begin with, but was pretty underwhelming in the end

5) I did genuinely like how there were many moments in the film where it didn't feel like a superhero movie. It slowed down and just focused on the interactions between the characters. Granted, whether you think those interactions were good, made sense, etc I leave to everyone's individual judgment.

Overall, probably on the lower-tier of Marvel movies for me. Like I said, I didn't hate it, because it did take a different approach. I loved many of the period settings as the story bounced through history. And I'm always a sucker for well-executed sci-fi/fantasy tales, and this definitely qualifies. For me it lacked that vital spark to really get engaged with the story. But I was still entertained nonetheless.

Final rating: 6, or 6.5/10",qn0q4y
hjdcl1w,"A lot of questions.

* The movie seemed to want us to root for the eternals to save humans because we are special. But to do this they had to prevent the emergence of the kind of being that creates billions upon billions of planets like earth with sentient species like humans?

------------

* Speaking of sentient creatures, were they ignoring other sentient beings on earth or were they included in what was needed for the emergence to occur?


* I'm totally lost as to why Arishem didn't actively prevent the eternals from stopping the emergence if he can whip them from earth whenever he/she/it wants

-------------


* I don't understand Sprites motivation of wanting to be human so she can grow? She's essentially lived for millions of years, and has remembered the last 7000. Does she just want an adult body? Wouldn't that change if the emergence happens and they go to a different planet in the bodies that resemble the new species they look after?

-----------


* How were the deviants still bad at the end? They were also trying to stop the emergence in order to save life?? How did the eternals and them not come together?

----------


* If the deviants were created to destroy the top predators but then became predators themselves, why do the celestial keep making them for each planet they're preparing for an emergence? Or were they s one time creation just for earth? If they were, how are there other eternals?

-----------

* Arishem had all of their memories collected and organized, why does he need to wait to review these 3 eternals before judgement?

------------

* Under the eternals logic, it's okay for humans to kill each other still? Or will they intervene now that they've peaked behind the curtain?

-------------

hjn80f2,"This movie was mis-marketed. Badly. And I believe this mistake contribute a lot to low-reception this movie is getting. Both the trailer and the promotional materials promise us one thing, when the movie itself is clearly more concerned with delivering another. It's one thing to try and keep spoilers hidden, but when they twisted the story so badly , lots of people are bound to get disappointed.

The most obvious part is with the Deviant. Well, everyone in this thread already knows they are not the main villains. But it's more than that. Deviants are basically glorified plot-devise in  this movie. They can barely even be called antagonists. The story is almost never about Eternals' fight against them (which is just a supped up version of pest control and not something you'd make a movie about). But , with the marketing department feeling they need to showcase some BAD guys, they decide to focus on it and even show us Kros to give an impression that deviants would be very important. Now that everyone expect some big fight against deviants from the movie, and while the movies does deliver those action beat, they are almost usually just eye-candy except two, and now people find the fights lacking. Well, yah, the movie itself treat it as pest-control and was never very interested in it (except in 2 cases..)

The next two points are less obvious but I think overall cause more harm to the movie and its reception. First , the trailer and the hype keep promising us ""an epic story through the ages"", highlighting scenes from different time-period to the viewers. However, the movie itself was NEVER interested in that. It never actually want to be an epic, and it didn't really told a story across the ages. We basically have 2 flashback sequence set in eras past , but what the flashbacks were about , was a lot more important than when the flashback happens.  The historical angles are just icing on the cake. It looks cool , it breaks up slower story place in the 1st act, but the actual movie itself never try to engage with the past. It uses them as a fun backdrop to showcase the characters and nothing more. So when people go see the movie expecting some storyline to be weaved through the history and that didn't happen, they get confused and disappointed. They feel this isn't the epic that the trailer promised it to be, and they blame the movie for either not delivering or being boring.

And the last point, which tied into the last one somewhat, is that breathless promise of a EPIC ROMANCE THROUGH OUT THE AGES BETWEEN THE TWO LEADS! Look at Gemma Chen! Look at Richard Madden! Look at these two beautiful person holding each other through out all these different time period! Theirs is love through the ages, eternal, as they themselves are! Then the audience watch the movies. and they wonder why the two supposedly lead barely have any intimate scene after the first 30 minutes, and why they felt so cold and distance to each other, lacking any chemistry at all, at least until Ikaris' betrayal was revealed anyway.

But if you actually watch the movies, you'd realize that it was never trying to tell a love story between these two. In fact, the whole time in which this movie take place, Sersi had long moved on from the dickish ex-boyfriend who ghosted her centuries ago. Even when he showed up out of the blue and saved her from a deviants, she isn't and would not show any interests to get back with him, at all. Meanwhile, the supposedly male lead was burdened with both the knowledge that what he is loyal to would eventually kill everything Sersi hold dear, and the guilt that he had killed his mother figure in Ajax. You could tell from Madden's performance that he longed for her but also that he couldn't let her get close to discover the truth until the 3rd act. For most of the movie they are in no shape to be in love with each other again and the movie itself also never try to push that. It highlighted Ikaris' lingering love and longing for Sersi, but it also make it clear that Sersi isn't returning any of it at all.

The trailer promise us a epic tale of love and romance and fight against monsters throughout the ages in human history. The movie itself is only concerned with the very human squabble of a family that was once happily together, had drift apart over the years, and now must turned against each other. There's a huge gap between these two and its no wonder people get disappointed when their expectation isn't met.",qn0q4y
hjd5eu2,"Man, I just have so many thoughts about this movie. I can definitely see why it's polarizing. The length is an issue and not all the time is well spent. But I thought this movie was really something. Is it Marvel Marvelling as hard as they've been known to Marvel? No, it's actually somewhat atypical for a Marvel movie. But I kind of appreciate that a lot. I think it's the first time I've watched a Marvel movie and outside the color pallette or genre been able to really tell who's behind the camera. 

The first thing I noticed is that the first hour or so is a bit sloppy, as far as conveying the story and how it weaves through time. It starts off with an, honestly a bit underwhelming, action scene, and from there goes into about an hour of setup. Which kind of makes sense because there's a lot of characters and they all have pasts and presents to get into, and I thought for the ensemble it actually was handled pretty well. But when the movie wants to slow down, it slows waaaaayyyy down. Which is both new for Marvel but also not really why people see Marvel movies. 

One thing I really appreciated about this movie was that I was really feeling the weight of the drama. Not only were there some interesting character moments and arcs, but also we are officially dealing with immortal Gods and the power they have and decisions they have to make have real gravity. I liked how there isn't really a correct answer here. I mean, there's an answer that continues to let Marvel movies take place on Earth, but whether or not it's worth the cost isn't something that any character is certain of. The main conflict of the movie really seemed to be that there are eight Gods on this planet and they all have very specific views on how much they should use their power to influence humanity and what their purpose is. I thought that was really well done and created a nice core for the movie. 

As I mentioned, it was cool to watch this and see Zhao all over it. Her eye for landscapes, her swooping camera movements were an interesting addition to the fight scenes and character moments, and her ability to convey feeling are all really present. It's no Nomadland, but each Eternal is asked to deliver some serious emotion at some point and I honestly thought they were all nailing it. I thought it was a hell of an ensemble cast. Even when it felt like they were just adding conflict and love plots willy nilly, I felt like the third act really brought it all home and gave everyone a purpose and an ending. 

But. It's very long. And as I mentioned, the first hour can be a bit of whiplash between past and future and this character and that one. I wouldn't say I had a hard time following it as the flashbacks are mostly I believe done in order, but there was just a lot going on and a lot of characters to keep track of. It still has a solid dose of Marvel fun, especially with Kumail and his valet, but also things that are oddly not Marvel like a nude sex scene or a room of people just crying together. But if you're looking for something as fun or as action packed or as well paced as we're used to from Marvel, I could definitely see disappointment. 

But in the end, that's kind of what I appreciate about this movie. It's very much not typical Marvel, and I think if Marvel is going to continue to innovate and surprise then there needs to be wiggle room for things like this. Something that swings for the fences or tries out a different lane. Something that maybe kids won't absolutely love. Even if they don't turn out perfect or give them another fresh tomato plaque for the office, it's apparent we are starting to get into weird shit like Blade (oh boy that post credits scene) and I think the Marvel formula could definitely do with some branching out. 

7/10. Probably one of the most emotional and atypical Marvel movies yet, and while it's not perfect, I had to say I enjoyed it and appreciated the hell out of it.

hss1fbv,"I literally fell asleep 1.5 hours in. Nevermind the crappy plot and borefest, why did they give these characters powers and abilities that other MCU characters already have?

hstv6iq,This movie didn't need to be made at all. I don't care about the characters or their boring powers.  The baddies went from being too hard to kill to too easy to kill. The post credits are setting up characters I care even less about. 4/10,qn0q4y
hsv4w7i,"The biggest problem with the movie is the main story. I don't know how the comic book was, but the whole Celestial being making more Celestial being to make more universes sounds dumb. And of course humanity has to be championed regardless of dark elements shown in the movie.

Most of the acting was wooden and unfortunately Gemma Chan is the worst offender. Salma Hayek was a bad miscast. 
She sounded like a sitcom mom. Angelina Jolie was good coz her role had some depth. Her face looks so crazy. She has the same look of 40-50+ women with countless surgery to look like 25. The GoT boys were average and side characters are actually decent. Kumail shines coz he is a good comedian and his comic relief was helpful to keep going.

 I do admit I liked the last part particularly the twist was nice but the excess CGI really atarted to bore me. I think I am done with superhero CGI fights, especially when their powers aren't well explained.",qn0q4y
hjovbd5,"Very disappointed by this movie. It brings up some interesting questions like someone who’s thousands of years old being stuck in a child’s body not being able to have the relationships she wants. I get why they didn’t go into it cause it’s just a marvel movie but it’s annoying how it brings up these deeper topics and doesn’t do anything with it. Also very odd how it doesn’t touch on the emotional impact of living while everyone around you dies over time. Many people have strong relationships but these are most likely not their first relationships and they would know the pain of watching them grow old and die. Again, an interesting topic the movie would never go into cause it’s following the safe marvel formula. I think something with this many interesting and deep ideas doesn’t translate that well to a marvel movie. But I’ve never read the comic so maybe that doesn’t go into this stuff either.",qn0q4y

That being said, it fell into the trap that kills so many DC movies, and that is they tried to cover way too much story in 1 movie so things seem rushed, character choices seem odd and there are too many plot points that just aren’t necessary in the grander scheme of things.

Enjoyed the flick. Really liked the casting as well. Shame about Gilgamesh and Kingo not being used for the full film. Ikaris ending was a little abrupt too (it was obvious so no downside there, but hasty). I liked the time changes too.

Druig took on Ikarus’s full laser combo no problem, and nothing before mentioned that he had exceptional durability so I assume the other Eternals are just as tough. Then Phastos basically solo’d Ikarus for a while when the others were busy, so I don’t get why they were afraid of losing to him as a team",qn0q4y

hm9hvbq,"I saw it last night. I'm with the critics. There are too many underdeveloped characters, it's too long, nothing much actually happens and the action scenes are extremely short and underwhelming. They should have either pared this down to a smaller, more manageable story with fewer characters or expanded it into a full TV series so that each Eternal can be more fully developed. I have no real interest in any of these heroes and I don't particularly care if they ever show up again.",qn0q4y
hszs07t,"So, the Deviants plot went nowhere. I assumed it was going to turn out that Deviants were actually mutated rebellious Eternals who were being punished for disobeying...but no. 

I also assumed there'd be a twist that the reveal about the ""truth"" of how Enternals were created was a gaslight to keep them following orders. They were actually super beings themselves that the Celestials knew could handle the transformation into being an Eternal (handling the energy to live for millions of years, memory wipes etc).

The way the Eternals are actually created doesn't make any sense from the creator's perspective. One of them was literally granted the ability to control minds without question. Why wouldn't the Eternals all be under this same mind control by Arishem to follow a pretty straight forward plan: Raise humans as food for new Celestials.

The apocalyptic level events in these movies have become beyond stale. This story could have been more intriguing with lower global stakes and higher personal ones.",qn0q4y

hjd6nis,"I feel like I need someone to explain to me why I loved this movie. The two people I went with were both mediocre on it, which is in line with the reviews it's getting, but I loved it. The only part that felt wasted or unnecessary was the stuff with the sentient deviant, which seemed to be a major plot point that just got cut for time (despite the runtime). 

Most of the cast, despite how many of them there were, were really unique and felt like complete characters, and I remembered all their names despite not knowing any of them going in. Basically all the character and human-centric stuff was really engaging, but I also love history and mythology so maybe that's why? It would probably bore the hell out of people that don't know where Tenochtitlan is or stuff like that. Out of all the Marvel movies to come out this year this was easily my favorite, but maybe it won't hold up to repeat viewings.

Also the humor felt really well-done? Marvel quipfests get tiring, and this *did* have quips, but the majority of it felt natural. When I used to argue about humor in the Star Wars sequels I would always bring up how the sequel humor felt like Marvel humor, not humor that was natural to the characters and their personalities like Han's ""boring conversation anyway"" in A New Hope. That's what the humor in this movie felt let like to me. It didn't feel jarring or forced it just felt like the characters being themselves, and so for as surprisingly much humor as the movie had only a couple of moments felt out of place. 

Overall there's a ton of reasons I can imagine why people didn't like the movie, yet it drew me in more than any other Marvel film recently and it just...felt different in all the right ways. It's not perfect but it had a ton of stuff I really liked that massively overshadowed the downsides. If the reason people go to Marvel movies is because it's just ""cool stuff people like"", and this one had less of that which other people like and it's reviewing poorly for it, I must just not be in that camp because it had a lot I liked that other Marvel movies don't.",qn0q4y
hjh9t50,"With all due respect, it really feels like we're giving this film a ton of leeway simply because we want so badly to like it. It's the MCU and I love it in all its mainstream glory, and I get that Eternals is an experiment in a slightly different direction, tonally speaking. But sometimes experiments fail. And that's what it felt like, sitting there for what felt like ages, waiting for it to get going. 

Was there really no better way to handle the exposition dump? Surely multiple sets of characters receiving info that now the audience already knows, one after the other, looks flat even on paper. How did that make it to screen?

If I'm supposed to root for Sersi why not spearhead the story better through her? She's the one who loves the humans the most and yet I barely felt anything for her when her beloved planet, as well as the person she loves (a perfectly charming Kit Harrington) are destined to die.
Her arc leading to her big saviour moment felt so uneven, largely in part due to lack of chemistry both with Dane and Ikaris. Maybe not the actor's fault - they didn't have the right kinda material to work that chemistry in. And that hurt the climax bad, given that Sersi versus Ikaris was a huge part of it.

Also, why do I find out about a massive twist (the one about their true purpose) through a passive flashback? Just off the top of my head, why not play it like a mystery that is uncovered by Sersi and some of the other characters noticing something was off and working together? Would have added pace and urgency, and made them more active instead of just info machines.

Also, the actor playing Sprite did not look like a kid. She could easily pass for 21 so this whole idea of an adult-child aching for a life she could never have because of her appearance falls flat when she looks like a goddamn adult. Imagine a legit child actor dealing with that pathos while also kicking ass - it's already more compelling. 

Sure the movie looked beautiful and yes it had its moments, but holy shit, it was a slogfest and I see no reason to pretend otherwise. It felt like it got too caught up in trying to break formula and explore heavy themes and ended up kneecapping itself in the process. For example, taking Kingo out of the climax. What? Why? So you could justify it with some character theory and call it a ""refreshing break from trope"" or whatever? Gee thanks for getting rid of one of the more fun characters, who is also super conflicted, in a climactic battle. 

Ugh, that was just a small example of the makers taking themselves too seriously. And the film suffered because of it. No number of gorgeously shot tedious scenes will change that.",qn0q4y
hjdy380,"I had a lot of problems with this movie. But I'm surprised nobody yet has mentioned:

1. The Eternal's default language 5000 years ago was modern english.
2. One of them was using ASL the entire time.",qn0q4y
hjmw3gt,"I went into this movie with an open mind despite not being excited about it. I figured if Shang-Chi could surprise me this one could do the same. It didn't. To put it nicely I thought this movie was a mess.

There were some good ideas here but it felt like they squandered every single one of them. The part I was most excited to see - humanity through the ages - was a letdown. That could have been done so much better. The jumping back and forth really took the punch out of a lot of those moments. 

Parts of the movie looked really good but, I'm sorry, wide shots of a house on a hill and repetitive golden hour shots aren't the peak of cinematography for me. I also didn't like any of the Eternals' costumes but that was something I knew from the trailers. 

The characters...Oof, where do I even start? The characterization in this movie was **bizarre**. None of these people came across like they had lived thousands of years. They were just normal people with powers. 

The only Eternals I liked were Gilgamesh, Thena, and Phastos. The rest ranged from ""Don't care about them"" to ""Actively dislike"".

It's wild to me that no one in this thread, as far as I saw, is talking about how much of a *monster* Druig was. This dude has been robbing people of their free will for hundreds of years. Multiple generations have lived under his control. And the movie barely addresses it. The most it does is have another character yell at him for actively using them as pawns during a fight. To me he was more of a villain than Ikarus. 

Sprite could have been done well. That story has already been done more than once, and very well, but it just didn't work here and she just came across as annoying.

The non-Eternals characters were fine. I'm kind of split on Dane. He was likeable and Kit Harrington played him well but when it was over I felt like they only put him in the movie for the post-credits scene. 

The stuff that worked, for me, was the creation and purpose of the Eternals and Deviants. All of that was great and I wish we could have seen more of it. I feel like there was an interesting movie in here, built off this premise, but they lost it along the way and never found it.",qn0q4y
hjdc71p,"I originally planned to make a whole post about directors with a distinct style and vision making blockbusters in the studio system (which I still might) but after having seen Eternals I'm not sure if this feels like a Chloe Zhao movie even if it looks like one. 

I really couldn't help but compare this to the Dune situation. That very much is a Denis Villeneuve film while also being a bombastic tentpole film and a pretty good Dune adaption. It isn't just cloaking itself in his visual style and calling it a day - which is what I feel happens with Eternals. Zhao deals with subjects of ordinary people dealing with overwhelming odds and nature to do something extraordinary - that is still very much small-scale, personal and within their limits. This worldview just does not carry over to Eternals - a story about gods among humans - at all. Visual style by itself is just that - its full power is only utilized when it evokes something in the viewer's mind. 

That's not really happening here. Here the use of natural light and real environments is 'just because'. Notice how there's also a lack of hand held and wide angled shots and the usual non-continuity editing that would have otherwise established the free flow of a film like Nomadland, where we are unmoored among these people and this place, just observing them be. In Eternals instead they are fighting one of the most uninspired CGI monstrosities in recent times. Or just looking off in the distance. The landscape no longer envelopes characters as they - and we- contemplate their place in this wide world. It's just used for pretty establishing shots. 

The reason I talked about Dune earlier was Villeneuve does everything he'd do in Villeneuve films too so it looks like his film - but because of the subject matter being somewhat closely aligned to the themes of his films (at least English language films, haven't seen the French ones) it also feels like his film. This was just a pretty underwhelming Marvel movie trying to look like Nomadland or The Rider. 

What was the movie ultimately even about? Despite being 2 and a half hours long not even the major characters ultimately ended up being significantly distinguished from each other. The past section of the film too does nothing in this regard - should the millenia spanning development of humanity also have informed character development of the Eternals significantly? The philosophical argument at the core of the conflict was also somewhat strangely hollow. The Celestials don't really make a strong enough argument about why existing worlds must be destroyed to create new ones and creation of a new Celestial. Even the Eternals don't debate about it. Hell the Eternals don't debate about anything really - anything that actually matters that is. 

Overall it's an empty shoebox that wraps itself in shiny paper and hopes you won't notice. 6/10.

Also some of the CGI in this was pathetic. Especially the one in the mid credits scene.",qn0q4y

hkadehs,"Man, this movie was all over the place.

It was overstuffed for one. They could have cut 30 minutes out of the film. Hell, that scene of the deviants in the ice cave screamed “cut this”.

Because it was overstuffed, it also felt poorly paced. The film pretty much had two low points that felt like the conclusion to two second acts. Third act was wonky too because of the Deviant issue which I’ll get to in a second.

I also felt a little out of touch with the charchters. I know Sersi is meant to be the protagonist, but I don’t really feel I followed her journey as well as I should have. Maybe it’s just me.

Also thematically, it is so weird that they killed the mega Deviant at the end. They’re all being manipulated by the Celestial, so wouldn’t it make more sense to overcome their violent purposes and work together to end the cycle? It also felt crammed into the final act.

I honestly wonder if they should have just done less flashbacks or maybe even make a Captain America styled “Past” movie with a “present” sequel. Maybe not, but the film just felt super overstuffed.

Also the audience score on RT and r/marvelstudios itself seems to show that MCU fans can’t accept one of their movies is bad. It wasn’t even that bad, just needed some reworking and serious editing.",qn0q4y

- Runtime was way too long. They could've cut down on all the flashbacks, one of them felt like it dragged on forever. There were way too many flashbacks, jumping back and forth between the present & past making the story harder to follow
- The Deviants especially Kro were wasted. Seems like they were just there to give the Eternals something to fight throughout the film. Kro was being built up to be a huge threat killing the Eternals off one by one and absorbing their powers, only to be killed off easily by a single Eternal. I would've expected him to at least heal himself but no he didn't even do that, they just killed him off.
- Ikaris' betrayal was an interesting plot twist. It just felt convoluted with him and the Deviants mixed in. It's like the writers didn't know what to do with the Deviants anymore once they made Ikaris the villain. Then Ikaris makes a complete 180 making for an anti-climatic ending. Was hoping that Kro would've survived through healing, give Ikaris some sort of redemption and that they'd all have one final fight but no. Edit: I must've missed it but I guess Kro could've fought alongside the Eternals through his evolved intellect which would've been cool to see too
- I don't understand why the enemies kept running away? During the fight in the forest Kro attacks, Ikaris shows up then Kro runs off to do whatever without even fighting him. Then after Ikaris betrayal he runs away rather than trying to kill off the Eternals. I know the writers have to give breathing room and space the fights out, but they could've done a better job.

The movie was just a huge CGI fest with forced diversity and pointless fights. If you take out the Deviants almost nothing changes besides a few Eternals not being killed off. Overall I give it a 6/10.",qn0q4y
hsrjwwl,Movie’s kinda mehh,qn0q4y
hsuz0eg,"This film just didn’t land for me at all. To put it bluntly, Eternals was just plain boring. Even the worst Marvel films up to this point have managed to at least have a fun and engaging protagonist or supporting cast you can root for to carry you through the film. The characters in Eternals though were all just so flat and lifeless. I didn’t care about anyone, and didn’t really know why any of them were making the decisions they did.

The plot is equally uninspired. The first two acts of the film are just the protagonists going from place to place assembling their party, occasionally fending off a Deviant attack or wasting time on needless flashbacks. It wasn’t until the final act that the story finally kicked in, but by then, I was so disinterested that I didn’t really care what happened. 

Just a thoroughly underwhelming experience overall.",qn0q4y
hsv2ez0,"This movie was stale, and that's pretty much it. Stale characters, like, Sersi pretty much has the same expression throughout and there isn't anything particularly interesting about her. I don't know why she was chosen to lead them. 

Ikaris is shown to be the noble, powerful good leader and then once it's revealed that he was lying to them all of a sudden, ""He's always underestimated Sersi,"" and ""I've always wanted to clip your wings."" Inconsistent. 

Druig may as well not even have been in the movie. He somehow understands the ethics of ""war bad, we should help if we can"" but doesn't have a problem with how unethical it is to just mind control a bunch of people and also throw them in a lethal fight. He's just there to be moody.

That's pretty much it. Ikaris was the most compelling, everyone else felt like cardboard cutouts of a character. That whole evolved Deviant angle was just...like what was the point?!?

That one scene near the end where Phastos is sitting and doing his magic mechanics to craft the singular mind or whatever is so awkward and icky to watch. He was also able to remove that orb from Sersi pretty damn easily, like why did they build tension for that? Everything is just so convenient.

hjk8lu5,"One of those movies that I kind of enjoyed watching and then left the theater and immediately thought “that wasn’t good”. 

There’s some potential. Some good twists and I genuinely liked that all the eternals have their own motivations. Some think the cycles should continue, others want to stop them to save humanity, and some want to stop them just to keep their memories or current relationships. While it’s stupid in context, I appreciate that Kingo just kind of up and fucks off. Because yeah, that makes sense for him, and he’s not really “evil” for doing so. 

But a lot of it falls apart, and it seems held back by being a marvel movie. All the names and terminology are… profoundly stupid sounding, the head deviant is both terrible looking in his final form and also has absolutely nothing going on to him - really thought he’d at least have the end goal of stopping the cycles as well and team up briefly. All the light based powers look like video game stuff, and the deviants look like some creature you’d fight in an MMO.

Also was surprised at the sex scene. It’s been a critique of these films that the heroes are so sexless, so it was nice to see them more rounded out with regards to their romances.

hkjep3g,"finally saw The Eternals and man, I get why some critics hated it lol. There are a lot of individual scenes that I liked but overall it just feels over stuffed with too many characters and subplots. This should've been a miniseries with 6-8 eps to really flesh out the relationships between the cast. I liked everyone and the family dynamic but it was way too much to do 10 characters and their backstories, the inter relationship drama, the individual subplots, and then do all the alien stuff on top of it. 

I like richard madden but damn he's super wooden for the first half of the movie and theres a GOOD reason for it but you gotta wait so long for the payoff. At least kit harrington looked like he was having fun lol. And whats up with making kumail's character a coward? He just walks away and doesnt help for the final fight?

hkp174z,"Movie was ok. Not as bad as critic reviews would have you believe, but not as great as the counter receptive audience reaction would want you to believe. I'm feeling a solid 6/10.

Most of my issues stem from the characters. There's just so goddamn many main characters and it feels like they want us all to care about them equally, but the execution leads to me only really caring about maybe at best half of them. Certain scenes that were clearly supposed to carry emotional weight, just didn't because I've literally only seen some of these characters on screen for 20 minutes at max. >!Ajak and Gligamesh's deaths come to mind, and it's even weirder when characters that have known them for centuries seem to be over it like 2-3 scenes later.!< Some character motivations and betrayals just kind of don't make sense either, and maybe they would have if certain characters got more fleshed out. Like the Peter Pan analogy seems like their way of explaining some things character wise, but what's being explained to me and what I'm being shown are two different things I feel.

Idk definitely not the worst MCU movie like some are trying to make it out to be (based only on RT Critics score). That title still belongs to Thor: The Dark World. Because at the end of the day I'd rather watch an inherently flawed but entertaining movie like Eternals, over a boring movie like Thor 2.",qn0q4y

hjdhmmt,"Random thoughts since I caught the thread early.

-	Sprite being upset about being immortal but its only ever shown to the viewer for 7 seconds at the dance club at the beginning.
-	“I have leftover power, want me to make you human?” How contrived and convenient!
-	First 30 minutes had several joke setups (mainly Kit Harrington) and not a single person in my theater laughed.
-	Big Bad absorbs his victims, starts talking to Thena in her closest friend Gilgamesh’s voice, “Thena, it’s me, your friend, Gilgamesh!”
-	Sersi “keep him busy while i run to the volcano”. Proceeds to casually run 20 miles to the volcano. Scene cuts to a fight for 15 minutes, cuts back to her still just casually running.
-	Sprite stabs Sersi, but she just turns the blade to water and is instantly healed?
-	Thena conveniently only having issues until she causes Gilgamesh’s death and than being nearly 100% the rest of the film.
-	Phastos trusting Thena around his son at the end despite knowing what she’s capable of.
-	Earthquake happens inside classroom. One kid - let me hide under this 1000lb artifact delicately hanging on the wall!
-	Big Bad Deviant arrives at well lit daytime beach fight! Well our CGI budget is spent, lets knock him into this cave where you can barely see his facial features (or anything else)!
-	Kingo literally just leaving the movie prior to the climax. This one I honestly couldn’t believe.
-	Ikaris and Sersi had zero chemistry. The scene where he holds her hand and tells her he loves her walking through the garden, I assumed was their first time meeting.
-	Sersi: “hi celestial being, im Sersi”. Celestial being: “hi Sersi, let me give you 22 minutes of exposition regarding my entire plan!”
-	At least 6 different scenes in this movie are just “the gang” casually walking up to someone’s house/barn/farm to talk to them.",qn0q4y

hjdhz15,"I see what the critics are talking about now.

This film really doesnt know what it wants to be, and you feel the strain of it.

On one hand, it's easily one of the best looking MCU films to date. Cinematography wise, this movie soars. It's gorgeous.

Plus it deals with some really interesting issues that transcend the sort of hero's journey plots that these movies usually have.

But then it relies on the same old MCU quip humor to diffuse tension when it does not need to be there.

Seriously.

Sprite gives this meaningful monologue about why she wants to start over, and she is suddenly decked in the head. 

It's meant to elicit chuckles, but it's just the MCU doing the same old MCU shtick. Diffusing tension when they didn't need to do it.

They should have let more moments breathe. 

There are proper ways to do humor without continually making quips to interrupt the scene. It's like the MCU isn't fully aware of this.

The quips felt really tacked on here.

It's also a seriously long movie. Like wow. (But that would have been fine if the characters were more engaging to me)

I see why the critics gave this one a hard time. I didn't hate it and it certainly has some great moments, but it's definitely a schizophrenic mess of a movie.

It's like the film wasnt fully confident in itself, so it kept relying on quips. 

Marvel really needs to stop turning everything into Whose Line Is It Anyway?

Natural humor is when you can let dramatic moments breathe but a character can still later on make a joke to ease the tension in the next scene.

Stop. Interrupting. Dramatic. Scenes. For. Jokes.

Let the drama play out first. Please.",qn0q4y
hjdeqy6,"I don't comment too much, but this movie was just a bit of a mess. It felt as if there were three different plots going on.

Thena's memory leaking could have easily been used as the plot point to discover the true purpose of the Eternals' mission, as she was seeing the past worlds they'd worked and could have remembered the endgame of the missions.

The evolving deviants could have easily been used as the plot point to discover the true purpose of the Eternals' mission, the main deviant practically spelled it out after killing Gilgamesh that the deviants were created to initially help create emergence.

And then finally, Sersi is the one to make the connection thanks to Ajak giving her the connection to the Celestials. 

Any three of those plot lines could have led to the exact same conclusion of the team discovering their true mission and going on to halt the emergence. But they crammed all three into the movie. I suppose it was to ensure so many big actors got a fuller story arc, but it was still a lot.

I also just felt there were a handful of plotholes and questionable calls. 

I do not know, but I assume Makkari was always using ASL? Which did not exist in 5000 BC?

How did Ikaris and Sprite (or the main deviant) find the point of emergence? Makkari never mentioned it until after they left the ship.

Why did Ikaris just yeet himself into the sun at the end? Sure he lost, but he still loved Sersi and didn't want to help her with the situation she was now in?

The opening crawl was worthless. All of the information on it was spelled out in the first 20 minutes, a lot of the time through direct dialogue.",qn0q4y

IMO the movie's problem is its failure to embody Drama. Perhaps those of us who have more developed imaginations can enjoy the film much more due to our brains filling in the blanks required for dramatic tension and emotional connection. But to me, I couldn't care less about those characters and their dilemmas. They were barely fleshed out, to the point the main love story collapsed into a cliche, and the dramatic suicide of Icaros registered more as a ""WTF"" moment than a fulfilling resolution.",qn0q4y

The movie wasn't too bad but the final act felt like a mess. Like, I could barely understand the motivation of half the characters at the end and the way the deviants and the Athena's sickness plotlines got resolved was lackluster.

And also, how can he be the Prince of Titan when he isn't even from there? He wasn't born on Titan. His parents didn't also give birth to Thanos. He was built by a celestial. 

Obviously I know things are different in the comics. But I'm talking about just the MCU here. It was legitimately the biggest question I had leaving the movie. Can someone please make this make sense for me?

Eros was an Eternal, built by a celestial. How can he then have somehow been born on Titan and had a brother?",qn0q4y

hlh7t7n,"So my thoughts...

I was expecting the Eternals themselves to be a little more powerful than they were (I mean one almost died from getting stabbed with a knife and another was taken out with a rock). Ikaris seemed to fall in line with what I thought they would be (although maybe not quite that powerful but even Ikaris seemed susceptible to the stabby stabs).

As for their characters, I didn't really get attached to any of them (although Kingo and his valet were my favorites) but I do understand we are getting introduced to multiple characters in a single movie so there's only so much you can do. I also thought is was a little silly that while they lived for millennia they mentally and emotionally didn't seem any different than normal humans. They would have had hundreds of lovers / spouses / families and yet somehow get caught up in some modern day relationships. We're just a blink of an eye to them and they didn't get caught up on any other planet in the past but somehow the ""humans are special"". Ajak saw us kill and love and die and laugh and it changed her, but none of the other countless species apparently did this over the past couple of million years.

I'm all for diversity, but if you're going to make super powered robots why take away one's hearing? Seemed like that would be caught in QA.

The quick scene where they placed Phastos in Japan in 1945 seemed a little weird (he wasn't a little conspicuous in 1945 Japan as a black dude? How did he get there all of a sudden?)

The visuals were awesome and I did enjoy the CG and actions scenes, however the Iron Man style CAD programming with hand movements is getting a little old.

I would have liked to see a little more from the sentient Deviant, he seemed like a fleshy version of Ultron to me but without the wit. Also, the Deviants didn't seem to be anything more dangerous than a lot of monsters various super heroes dispatch so I'm not sure why a group called The Eternals who existed before time could only intervene if the Deviants attacked. Thanos was MUCH more of a threat.

As for their power as a team, I think that someone like Magneto, Captain Marvel or Dr. Strange could probably defeat the whole Eternals team by themselves. All in all I thought the movie was ""ok"". Not sure how I felt about Harry Styles showing up either, seemed like they were trying to inject some Guardians of the Galaxy humor in at the very end.",qn0q4y

I liked it enough, though I agree it shares a lot of problems others have mentioned already. It was different from the rest of the MCU which was nice, like it had it's own vibe going and probably would have worked better as it's own separate thing from the MCU

But for the whatever Phase we are on now, 4? What storyline are we following now exactly? With Shang Chi the rings were doing something mystical, then we have this Celestial-stuff going on which on it's own is like the biggest threat ever if it decides to come back, then lastly we have some multiverse-shenanigans going on with Doctor Strange (haven't seen the Spider-Man yet) which is confusing as it is too... Everything seems to be going to a different direction and they are introducing so much people, powers and worlds and then you wonder where have all these people been all this time and so on until finally you are like oh no my brain is melting aaaaaaaaahhh

It's all too much in my opinion and I have no idea what we are building towards now and it's like things are starting to not make any sense to me. With Thanos phase it was like they were building a house of cards - carefully planned the foundation, card by card and it was finished by Endgame... But then the bosses order them to make it bigger and now they are making these weird towers everywhere, it's getting too big and everything is starting to wobble and collapse @_@

Visually gorgeous, great art direction, design and CGI -- I'll have this on in the background if I have to get some work done. And the action scenes were very well done, I was never confused about who was fighting who.

The movie had a definite Roger Zelazny feel to me: Zelazny was great at reinventing mythologies and coming up with interesting new interpretations on who various mythical beings actually were. I'm not saying it was as good as Zelazny, because practically nothing is, just that it was in the same ballpark, which is something you can say about very few movies.

My only problem with the movie was, I think it should have been longer ... a LOT longer. A TV series, in fact. The pacing was just way too fast, and it was obvious that they skipped over a lot of stuff to get the movie where they wanted it to be. I've never read the Eternals comics, so I don't know for a fact that this is so, but it definitely feels like it's so after watching the movie.

ht1etzz,"OK so the eternals dropped on Disney plus and I watched it this weekend.

It was bad in my humble opinion.

Why was it bad? The script was why.

This was the most lazily written marvel film to date.

I've read through the comments here and they are spot on.

So many examples of poor storytelling developing characters that do nothing, honestly if you're going to have kit Harrington doing a fabulous job of being affable and having good chemistry with Gemma Chan while the locked down buttoned up character Richard Madden had to work with... was just terribly written. If you're going to do that, have more Kit Harrington!

Madden did the best he could to try to deliver a character who has made a torturous decision putting what he believes ahead of what he loves.

The lines and the events just didn't give him the chance. He needed to have an emotional breakdown at some point and he only had one admission of his conflict and it rang hollow.

They spent the whole movie developing this creature who could suck out the powers of eternals and become more self aware.

I'll fix the end for you right now, Ikarus and the Deviant are working in parallel to bring about the birth of the Celestial when Ikarus is defeated by the Eternals the Deviant then attacks, and drains another of the Eternals (it doesn't really matter who, maybe Ikarus himself, yeah actually that would work), then you have the reveal, this creature is actually an eternal he looks like an eternal when he's fully come into his powers and he states that his purpose is to link with the Celestial and get back into Arishem's good graces, you see the deviants just lost their minds as they fed on predator after predator, because they are what they eat, if they eat eternals they become eternals and subject to their central programing... the problem is that the central programing is bad for earth and earth is special.

Epic battle ensues where the deviant is making for the node that links him to the celestial, just being on its skin isn't good enough you have to bury a temple under the sea earlier in the narrative and that ancient temple becomes the node's location where the Eternals are safe during the celestial's birth, remember how that stupid piece of exposition at the end was thrown in to explain how the main character resolved the whole plot? That's terrible story telling, I just fixed it (smarter people than me could have fixed it better probably).

So you would then have:

Battle with Ikarus

Ikarus gets eaten by the beast

Battle with beast, maybe you have Cerci use the pellet she has to reclaim all the powers from the Deviant after turning it into a tree (another terrible piece of story telling was having her turn one deviant into a tree and never having her master that higher power).

Now you've built the beast up to be REALLY strong and the audience is going to have that Marvel moment where they don't know how the heroes are going to take out this bad guy when they were almost defeated by one fraction of its power.

Also there's an action note here, the monster only used one power at a time, it would have been much more exiting if he'd used several at once.

There are a lot of other dead ends in this movie that needed to be tied into the plot and just never were. It was like a story written by an eight year old in blank exposition.

Also the love story didn't work at all, it was pure butchery, but did give rise to the only emotional touch point in the movie (which could still have been used in the beast battle) ""if he loves her and she loves the world how can he destroy it?""

So then you just have that moment when Ikarus becomes part of the deviant and the deviant calls him up to distract and weaken Cerci but then Ikarus manages to redeem himself by holding the creature in his control long enough for Cerci to kill the deviant.

And then we don't have Ikarus flying into the sun which was almost comical if it hadn't been so on the nose it might have been funny.

What I would note here is that, for all its long dialogue scenes the movie had very little character development, and when there was such development it was so heavy handed as to almost be breaking the fourth wall, so there was some failure in direction I guess but again rooted in the script.

A good example of this is the peter pan scene, would have been way better if Kumail Nanjani said it into his documentary camera because at least you would be able to poke fun then at all the melodrama and have another excuse for someone to break the camera.",qn0q4y

htsm2ir,"Not knowing anything about the comics, I really liked just about everything. Then not interfering with Thanos seems a little odd and there were some weird parts but I loved the celestial stuff. Makkari is a really awesome character, especially since I’ve always liked The Flash and Quicksilver. I hope The Eternals become more important characters in the overall story.

• She has thousands of years of knowledge why would she need to go to school?
• She was upset because she couldn’t grow up, fall in love, start a family? Why can’t she do those things? Because she can’t have children? Couldn’t she adopt? 

It would’ve made more sense if she looked like she was 7 and not 14.",qn0q4y
hjwek07,"Oooh boy. Lotta thoughts!

Pros:

- Cool visuals

- Interesting themes and moral concepts (albeit underbaked ones)

- Made some bold choices regarding character deaths and hero to villain turns

- I liked Barry Keoghan as Druig and Richard Madden as Ikaris. They were the two most compelling and believable Eternals.

Cons:

- Some of the dialogue is just *cringey*. The standout being Sprite's monologue after she stabbed Sersi. Unintentionally hilarious. The characters *do not* talk like millennia old demigods, even in the flashbacks. 7,000 years ago they talked like 2021 millennials. Ikaris, Ajak, and Druig were the only ones I bought as immortal beings.

- The Deviant villain was just baffling. Shows up out of nowhere halfway through the movie, is completely removed from the overall plot, and has a completely unnecessary one on one with Thena. They *could* have gone in an interesting direction by flipping the dynamic with the celestials being bad the deviants being good, but instead they are just both shoe-horned in as villains but one gets way more attention.

- Sprite gets forgiven *way* too quickly for trying to **murder Sersi**. They just hug it out? After a murder?

- The whole ""unimind"" was underdeveloped and really generic. 

- Kit Harington's character was completely shoehorned in.

- Way too many crappy jokes and bathos.

- Far too much exposition.

- It's a nitpick, but why did Arishem kidnap Kingo at the end? He didn't fight to destroy the new celestial.

- Second nitpick, but Arishem's size was *wildly* inconsistent. In the end scene they show him from the sky, and his face is seemingly small enough that it can be viewed from any one spot on earth, but then they zoom out and he's suddenly way larger than the entire planet? The scale was way off.

- Third nitpick: that kid at the beginning did not give a single shit that his dad just got devoured by a space monster. He's completely calm when meeting Sersi.

- Fourth nitpick: the Eternals' directive is to increase the population. Thanos is a **direct** challenge to their duty. But they can't stop him? It seems like they absolutely *should* have interfered, and this is just lazy writing to explain why they're not present for the Avengers movies.

- Fifth and final nitpick: that ogre in the end credits scene looked dumb as fuck.

- Alright, the big issue. The characters. Sersi, our lead, is completely uninteresting. We hear over and over about how she ""has the most love for humanity"", but never see it in action. I can't tell you a single personality trait, flaw, or motivation she has. In a movie full of underdeveloped characters, the main character is the least compelling. The character motivations, choices, and development make **zero** sense. There are these long scenes of discussing morality and the role of the Eternals, and they do nothing to set up why the characters do what they do. Sprite just turns evil because she has a crush, Ajak changes her entire motivations after **millions** of years, Kingo just dips out and is like ""fuck it, why not let humanity get destroyed"". Gilgamesh dies halfway through the movie, but his death is pointless! It does nothing to set up other character's arcs, and it doesn't feel like the conclusion of his arc. I'd say it's to motivate Thena, but she rivals Sersi for the least interesting Eternal. The only interesting trait she has is the barely explained or explored thing where she turns temporarily evil sometimes. Was Gilgamesh's death really just to set up the fight with the CGI side boss? (also, Thena fighting the Deviant guy is the source of the movie's single worst line, where she responds to something like ""revenge won't heal your loss"" with ""killing him will"". Like what? Bitch that's what revenge is!) 

- cont: Makkari just shows up halfway through and feels completely unnecessary to the story. In fact, I'd say half of these characters are pointless. There are just too many of them. They spend two hours just collecting Eternals, half of which get barely any personality or screentime. Then they have one meeting, Ikaris and Sprite betray them, and then they fight and the sentient Deviant shows up and fights Thena for no reason. The characters that end up siding against the celestials and the ones that don't just feels random and arbitrary. A good conclusion should feel like all of the character's choices inevitably lead up to the ending. This resolutions of the character's arcs (if you can even call them that) feel half-baked and randomly selected.

Ultimately this was an entertaining and visually appealing movie, but the writing was just abysmal. The moment to moment dialogue, the flow and pacing of the plot, and the character development were all really botched. This movie *had* some interesting ideas and *could* have followed through with going in an interesting direction, but the execution was a mess. This is probably one of the weakest MCU movies, and that's coming from a franchise filled with generic, cookie cutter movies. 4/10.",qn0q4y

I watched this in the same theater I saw Wolverine Origins and at least that movie had the decency to end in a reasonable amount of time. My distaste and disappointment are echoed.

Could they have spent more than $5 animating Pip?",qn0q4y
hjg4qu0,"This is bottom tier Marvel IMO. I really wanted to like it I really did.

The good: visuals, the effects and the fight scenes for the most part are great. Kumail and Brian Tyree Henry were stand outs of the eternals. 

The bad: it’s way too long. There’s too many characters. Why are they speaking English in flashback sequences? Richard madden was so stiff I didn’t give any shit about his character or his betrayal. Lauren Ridloff was given zero character development, she was just there, this felt like a token disabled character and I think that’s too bad, they really underutilized this character. Keoghans character was such a waste of screen time. Kingo, the most interesting of the eternals, mostly because of kumails performance, just leaves, says peace I’m out and turns up after the final battle like he helped. Like why wouldn’t they have him comeback, have a change of heart, and join the battle. 

The ugly: the best character development is Karun the guy who films kingo, a third rate joke character shouldn’t be the one we care about most. 


Ultimately I think they needed to downsize the number of characters, Druig wasn’t needed, Gilgamesh could have done either way. They should have framed the story differently, should have used sersi explaining to Jon snow and the reason for the flash backs and dumped them all right there. Use the flash backs as a chance to develop the characters, show their early optimism and then resentment the closer we get, the film kind of did this but by splitting it up the way the movie did it was very glossed over. Create an alien language for the eternals, the should not be speaking English in Mesopotamia, also remove their costumes when they’re interacting with normal people it looks ridiculous. Show ikarus as having a genuine connection to humans and the other eternals so that when he is the betrayer it has weight to it. In the final act, having 3/4 villains was too much.the attack on London should have been the last deviant which led to the emergence, this way we don’t spend so much time on a red herring only to have it be pointless at the final confrontation. The final battle should have been just ikarus, sprite and kingo against the rest. The emergence should have been to focal point to whole movie.

hjdqz5l,"Just came out of the theater watching the film. To me, I thought it was enjoyable and engaging, but that’s because I actually read some of the comics that featured the Eternals. So I was familiar with the source material to an extent. 

It’s not a perfect film and it has some flaws with the story, mainly that it is a bit too ambitious and tries to do so many things at once. I can understand why some critics had a problem with the film. 

Although, it’s certainly not a horrible film as it is beautiful to look at. But that can only go so far if the story isn’t well developed or if it’s all over the place. 

I do like the mythology of the Eternals and it was cool to see the Celestials. Though I do wish the Deviants were more compelling villains. 

I do feel a bit bad for Chloe Zhao as she had just won an Oscar for her previous film and has now put out a film that is a bit mixed in reception. Perhaps she should go back to making smaller scale movies that are more suitable to her tastes.",qn0q4y

hjij93n,"That was pretty god-awful. The vibe in the theater was pretty dead.  

Time by Pink Floyd was misused at the beginning. Kind of a waste.  
The editing for the flashbacks was mostly terrible.  
The scrolling text at the beginning was pretty bad.  
So many exposition dumps. The one by the celestial to Sersi was especially heinous, and maybe it was just because I saw Dune recently, but it felt like they had to explain absolutely everything. They never showed, they always told.  
When Tiamut emerges from the ocean floor, that absolutely kills everybody on the beach and creates tsunamis on all the neighboring coastlines.  Literal mountain-sized fingers and head coming out of the water. Ikaris is strapped down on the beach.  
Some of the character motivations just didn't make much sense.  
One point I was pretty confused on was how Druig seemed to stop the volcano from erupting, but a few minutes later, he tells Sersi that he can't do this and that she'll have to do it herself.  
Sersi running towards the volcano that was 10 miles away was really freaking stupid.  
Thena's illness was handled sloppily. Her standing by a tree while Gilgamesh gets drained was really stupid.    
Good twist about Ikaris and the reveal, but Ajak kind of goes out weakly. We obviously already know she died, so it makes sense not to waste time showing it, but she never really got a chance to shine.  
The whole judgment thing in space at the end was blah. A good visual and shocking when he showed up, but leaving it unresolved was weak sauce.  
The movie just never really seemed to build any momentum.  The squad calmly going their separate ways after Ikaris reveals his intentions before they head off to the island basically killed any energy that was there.  
Besides the deviants getting a small strength buff, they were never portrayed as a major threat.  

I don't know who to blame for this one.  Is it the writers, the source material, the director, or the folks that are really driving the MCU? Probably never gonna watch this one again.",qn0q4y
hjd5zxe,"Holy shit how did this happen? 

The story is an interesting “cosmic” universe type with some twists and betrayals and complexity, there are a few banger pop songs on the soundtrack, the cast are talented, the director is amazing, and the writers even threw in some “make fun of DC” humour…but somehow this movie is a two and a half hour cake wreck. There are moments it feels like there’s a reel missing, or that the score is out of sync, it’s so random. 

Did this get taken away from the director and finished by a committee or something?

This might be the worst-made film of the whole MCU so far. If not for the big names and expensive effects, this would feel like a fan film.",qn0q4y

I know some people might hate Karun but I loved him, disappointing that Kumail dipped in the final action sequence but I guess I understand. Paper boy came in clutch with his tech and speedy girl beating on Robb Stark was fun to watch. 

Would it come in my top 5 MCU film list? No, but did I enjoy it and recommend it to others? Yes.

The story was working with such big, lofty ideas and I hard time rationalizing it. I guess I was just one of those people that wanted something that felt more like a Marvel movie and it frustrates me because I recently started harping to friends that the Marvel movies are starting to feel like the same personality over and over.

As far as the likes, I liked Ikaris' turn and the beach fight. I liked the Celestials and the image of Tiamut rising up out of the ocean was awesome. Overall, though I said I felt I wanted more Marvel-ness out of it, I can respect how ambitious it was. Even if it didn't knock it out of the park for my tastes, I thought Zhao took some impressive swings. Trying to introduce nine god-like heroes and make you care about them is a huge task and I thought it was handled about as well as it could have.

To sum it up: Of the Marvel movies, it felt the most like a DC movie.",qn0q4y
hjlqgb1,"That was a weird trip. I feel like the audience is soooo used to getting street level stories for the MCU and in this movie we just got a huge canon/expose/story dump for big picture stuff that is almost ironically not important if that makes sense (as in it's not interesting)? It felt like they just dumped like 20 characters on us at once and then expected everyone to be invested into all of these people (hell Salma was onscreen for like 5 minutes). And then with the credits scenes they dump even more characters that are further from the more known characters. I understand that this is how we got characters like Ironman and GOTG, but they were built up over a long time on their own so just shoving them into the MCU like this is sloppy. 

Then on top of everything else, the story itself was kind of mehh; it felt like an excuse to shove as many actors into the MCU at once as possible. There were several cool fight scenes though but otherwise I honestly put this movie as low as Thor 2. Kumail was the one thing that saved any aspect of the movie for me",qn0q4y

Did not understand the whole story.   Eternals/Deviants are put on earth to do what.  they are supposed to not interfere with human kind.   Simply plant your Celestial seed and wait thousands of years for them to come alive /no need to add eternals and deviants.

hjdilwm,"This is a bad movie.

First, the fact that Chloe Zhao thinks her movie/message is so important, it deserves three, felt like four hours of my time… in a fucking Marvel movie,with none of the charm (I’ll get to this later), is pretentious, ridiculous, demanding and ludicrous. But wait? There’s comic book movies that are around that time - who cares? Yes, there are. You don’t notice the running time of say, The Dark Knight, because it’s characters are developed and the story and tension keeps upping itself in engagement. Avengers: Endgame clocks in the same time, and guess what? We don’t care because we’re so invested in this. It balances tone, character development, pacing perfectly. Eternals does none of that.

Instead, you’re treated like a moron. Scenes are repeated, dialogues are straight exposition dumps and not even shy about it. Editing? Nah, fuck that, let’s just pile scene on scene on scene because this movie is so IMPORTANT it deserves this grandiose theatre. Whoever edited this movie must of just shown up and did nothing cause there is so much extra padding for a relatively straight forward story, it’s insane. There’s flashbacks but in the present that unfold in probably the dumbest way I’ve see. It’s like Zhao heard Scorsese’s comments and went “yeah the viewers are dumb so I’m gonna treat them that way”.

Now let’s tackle the cast. Wow, besides Kit Harrington who has little to do with the actual movie and Druid, this is the worst thrown together, “everything but the kitchen sink” assemble I’ve ever seen. Let’s have Angela Jolee as a major selling point, but…make her basically a robot. Kumail? Oh he’s funny, make him jacked and put him as comic relief for scenes that really really should not have it. Madden and Chan? They’re wonderful, let’s make them have the least chemistry we can to put to screen and use the excuse that their gods. Brian Henry is literally introduced 2 fucking hours into this movie, just for a unnecessary “gay” plot (I’m assuming to give Disney street cred, it serves no other purpose) and MORE unnecessary comic relief. I don’t even want to touch on Salma Hayeks character. She lets genocide happen cause she listens to her master, but wait? She loves human so she should stop her master from committing genocide. Huh? It took Thanos for you to change your mind? Then why didn’t you fucking help, since at that point, when Cap says “Avengers Assemble!”, you had already had a change of heart. This shit.makes.no.sense.

Now, for the plot. Gods made angels to protect humans, demons are attacking but have hibernated. Angels need to come back and betray their God because God wants to wipe up humans for something better. That’s the plot and it’s standard biblical shit, we’ve seen it before. It is stretched out and made so confusing to add in a stupid love affair between two people who once again, seem like they’re looking at a wooden box when interacting. And for what? So they can fight each other as the big battle? I guess the ultra deviants really don’t matter at all.

And do you like soundtracks that give you that cool warm Marvel feeling? Well toooo fucking bad, here’s some out of place classic rock and OST stuff you’ll never remember again.

There is one thing good about this movie. It’s cinematography. Other than that, it has the tone of a 2009 X Men movie stretches out with Zhaos dumb grandiose philosophical shit. This is not a good movie and fuck me, I went in ready to be so forgiving. But I literally feel insulted that they thought they deserved 3 hours of my life for this and Feige even made a Oscar award joke. Get fucking real.

The pistol guy who says Thor was a fanboy for example, why would he ever be. Seems like that would be a solo job for thor considering what he has done in the past.

All the characters worked really well. I had reason to sympathize with every one of them and each character was able to be developed despite being ""new"". Everyone was right in some way, and wrong in others. Ikaris' final shot was damn cool and made some sense.

Although, I could have done with some cuts. It felt like it was on the edge of too-long. A lot of the flashbacks and exposition were done really well, but others felt unnecessary. But then again, we had a lot of characters to develop in a short amount of time so it's a bit understandable.

hk7584x,"The movie is pretty fresh on my mind. I enjoyed it. If it were shorter, or removed some of the flashback scenes, or removed parts that really, the Eternals shouldn't have been at every major event and influenced all of humanity around the world, because that just makes humanity seem really incapable.

Otherwise, there's really good room for world building. It would have worked fantastic as a shorter film without the Deviants and the Flashbacks, because those first 40 minutes really changed pace over and over and over.

Worse still, a flashback to Hiroshima in the middle of the film that really advanced nothing. We had already met Phastos who was in a happy relationship. We didn't need to see that he hated humans once. It was already said, and then re-said a few minutes later.

What I loved is that the characters all stand out. Gilgamesh, Druig, and Thena are my favorites out of this cast.

Gilgamesh was hilarious. His character very caring. Very powerful as well. The dude could kill Deviants, who are strong as hell, on his own. Ikaris struggled to fight one with his strength,s peed, and vision beams, but Gilgamesh pimpslapped a Deviant and it died. Awesome.

Druig is very complicated. On his reunion he had a lot of development in a short timeframe. His powers seem sinister, and even he himself can appear to be a sinister being with how he used his mind control power. But all in all, it was for the good of the people he cares for.

Thena, I did not expect to like her as much as I did. Broken memories, visions, and most of all a very badass fighter. As good as her character was, she was very disjointed from the other Eternals. Not because of her condition, but because it seemed like there were two movies playing here at once.

One for the Eternals, and the other for the Deviants.

Kro was a great idea for the Deviants. A shame his character only gets maybe 15 minutes screen time, because there seems to be some depth there with him that is still missing.

It's actually a mostly enjoyable movie. As for the ""wokeness"". I dunno man. The only thing that stood out to me that people didn't like and referred to  as being woke is the Gay characters, who shared screentime together for maybe 10 scattered minutes and they actually seemed like really cool dads.

The fight scenes and visuals, definitely some of the best in the MCU featuring super powers. Again, each character stands out from the others. As such, **HOLY SHIT MAKKARI!**.

She loved to hit those Sonic Boom blasts and punches. Especially during that final fight. I wasn't sure how much more he could have taken from Makkari. She could have solo'd so many beings.

The fight in the Amazon again showcases each characters strengths and abilities.

Kingo spamming his blasts and charging up his killer shots was visually amazing.

Sprite using invisiblity and projection casting against the Deviants, again, visually amazing.

Ikkaris just lasers, lasers, lasers. Nice to see a Superman-type actually using his laser beams, and apparently flying faster than light?

I thought the movie is actually good. The ""wokeness"" aspect didn't bother me so much, since it wasn't heavily addressed. It was just 10 Immortals living their lives. They didn't make a point about their genders or sexuality.

What bothered me was the pacing and length. For all the density of the story, it could have been fleshed out better as an 8 piece series rather than a single film.",qn0q4y

I liked it a lot on first thought. I thought it raised interesting questions and gave interesting answers to them and was more thought provoking than your standard MCU movie 

The action was p cool for the most part although the characters powers were not given much ability to shine (they just spam heat vision and magic dr. Strange shit a lot)

But my main issue was with the absurd amount of exposition and useless stuff they presented. Like we did not need to get different intros for like 4 characters or like the entire deviant subplot of them turning into ultron looking things. It felt kinda annoying to go from so much time wasted or useless scenes to a massive exposition dump in that one arishem sequence back to wasting time till the ship scene which was really good

I see a lot of people saying this movie was more character driven and if that is the case, in my eyes they failed there too. I found almost every one of them bland and boring.

I feel like they were trying to tell what should have been some epic and incredibly tragic story.  Friends/companions/lovers through the ages of humanity, and then torn apart/betrayed.  Unfortunately, it's hard to properly build that up for effect in an hour or so of screen time.  If this had been a mini-series or perhaps a third movie in a series then it might have had much greater effect.  Instead we're just not invested enough in the characters and situation, and so even the big betrayal at the end doesn't carry the weight it should have.

The movie itself is also felt a bit different than other Marvel movies.  I guess not being human and instead such long-living beings means that some of the human foibles and snappy dialogue we are used to in such films wouldn't have fit, and instead were portrayed (for the most part) in a manner much more aloof, as you might expect from an immortal, godlike being.

Anyway it was't terrible by any means, but I didn't feel it was that great either.  I started to feel more interested once more of the background and plot got revealed about halfway through, but it never really rose past the level of somewhat tepid interest.  It kind of feels like they needed to do another movie first to let us get to know some of the characters better, and feel more invested in them.",qn0q4y

hjye32y,"So I just watched this movie last night and... I kind of loved that. Okay, it's not perfect but no MCU movie is. Any problems I have with it are small gripes, or nitpicks. I adore this cast a lot, I loved almost every one of these characters, I loved the way this story was told, and the freaking size & scale of this movie is phenomenal. On top of that, this is the best looking MCU movie IMO, with just stunning cinematography and mostly good effects (A few bad ones I noticed but again, almost any MCU movie you can do that too)   


I get that this movie is not going to be for everyone, but still, I feel like I might be in the minority of loving this movie, and I think the criticisms against this movie are either being made out as bigger problems than they are, or they're criticisms from people who I don't think were actually watching the movie. This isn't in my top 5-10 MCU movies, but I loved this so freaking much! It's a long one that takes a lot more to process but I love that so much was unpacked here in such an interesting way, and the ambition of this movie feels earned with who these characters are.

hka6dfh,"I’m a few days late but I saw this today, seizing the opportunity of a day off from work. 

Ultimately I just didn’t feel much during the whole movie. I think I didn’t really care for about half the Eternals. I didn’t believe Ikaris and Sersi at all as a couple, they had no chemistry. The fight scenes were OK. I don’t really love the direction it pushes the MCU in either, I usually find the smaller the story is the more I like it (spider-man homecoming for example), unless it was a big event like endgame/IW. It’s hard to point out what was really bad but it just didn’t feel impressive. I went on the marvel studios subreddit and they seemed to love it. Seems like opinions here are a little more muted. I liked Shang Chi a lot more even if I didn’t care for the CGI-fest moments at the end of that movie without getting into spoilers. 

For a while I was hesitant about seeing heroes I didn’t know from marvel but I started to trust them. Now I feel like I trust them less and wouldn’t care to see more of the Eternals.

Def doesnt deserve all the bad reviews...but it was humorous to think Marvel was having oscar talk with this film beforehand. 🤣🤣🤣 Sure its a different type of Marvel movie and I respect that but the plot was all over the place. Heard at least 3 people snoring in my theater too. The middle was messy. Constant time jumps were expected but I am sad we didnt see more historical eras. I was confused by Angelina's character for half the film but then I really liked the whole ""I have too many memories"" angle they pulled. Like...what would our brains do with too many memories? Our memories make us who we are so to lose your memories is to lose oneself. I assume in Eternals 2 they will recover their older memories? Or fix angelinas problem? Jon Snow seemed COMPLETELY unecessary and i bet he filmed all his scenes in like 3 days. Lol but I like him as an actor so its allowed. Why did Kumail just dip on the finale though? Scheduling conflict in real life? So in canon, was he over in India also hovering to give Cersei power in the final fight? Seemed odd he was absent. Camerman was the MVP for sure. Also the LAST thing that really bothered me was that ""amazon rainforest"" set was WAYYYY too deciduous. Did they not even look at trees!? Completely took me out of the scene and didnt feel like a rainforest at all except for the ariel shots.

There doesn't feel like there's any stake in the film. Flashing back and forth is disconnecting, the Deviants feel like animals and not any real threat. By the time they get around to explaining Earth as giant egg, there's still no stake because you know Disney won't let the planet be ripped apart.

Right about the time they were going to Ajak's farm I was thinking ""One of these people really should have been killed by now... because I'm not feeling the threat...""

The lead Deviant, absorbing power and knowledge was wasted. They had an opportunity at the end for him to join the Eternals against Ikaris, but didn't, which calls into question the entire 7,000 year history of the Deviants.

Visuals were really fucking great aside from some wonky looking stuff during the beach battle + Pip looking hella weird in the mid-credit scene. Like seeing Tiamut begin to birth and then just having his head and part of his hand **frozen out of the water** as a permanent thing on earth feels like it could make for a really cool place to return to at a later time. 

Insane ending too, probably one of my favorites for an MCU movie with Arishem just showing up next to Earth and literally yanking Phastos, Kingo, and Cersei off of it. Excited to see Harry as Eros as I enjoyed him in Dunkirk and it seems like he’s set to jump full into acting with My Policeman and the Olivia Wilde joint with Florence Pugh.

hjddab2,"Oof glad some of you seem to like it but this did next to nothing for me and is bottom tier MCU. Far too many characters to introduce all at once meaning I didn’t feel connected to any of them, tons of really great actors totally wasted in nothing roles, action scenes which all felt the same as each other, humour which really falls flat. Marvel have upped their quantity this year but not necessarily their quality and are having an incredibly hit and miss year IMO.",qn0q4y
hjdr39m,"So you know the first 40 minutes of the Avengers? How it’s sort of about getting the team together? It’s fun because it doesn’t feel too long, and we know these characters from their own movies in Phase One. So it’s enjoyable seeing them clash and come together.

Now imagine that, but twice as long, no Phase One movies, and characters even more obscure than the Avengers (in the 2008-2012 time period, of course). Characters who we have zero connection to, and almost zero conflict between them or who they are as *characters*. Also, replace the delectable villain of Loki with a bunch of random frost giants that don’t speak.

Now, Eternals isn’t all bad. The first moment I felt “life” in the movie was when Druig stood up to the Eternals and felt bad about not helping humans out. Finally, some conflict. When Icarrus is revealed to have betrayed them is when the movie started to win me back over. I’m not sure the exact time in the movie this took place, but it felt like it was more than 1.5 hours in, which was far too long for me to feel almost no investment in these characters. When Phastos gets his scene with his family, I’m starting to feel for some of these people.

I actually found the third act quite enjoyable. I felt quite bad for Sprite, being trapped as an adult in a kids body for thousands of years. The set piece of the Celestial emerging was one of the breathtaking things I’ve seen in a Marvel movie.

Everything to do with the deviants felt pointless, as well as a waste of time, and their design felt straight out of Justice League (I mean this as an insult). Arishem looked so damn cool and menacing every time they were on screen.

Overall a 5 out of 10. 6 if I’m being generous. Zero interest to see it again anytime soon, which is pretty rare for me and MCU movies, but it was an ok time at the theatre.

A few words on the post-credits scenes: I am slightly worried that almost none of the mid/post credits scenes have intrigued or excited me at all this year. Except maybe the one Black Widow one Valentina.

Also the madlads actually did it: they actually made Icarrus fly too close to the sun (though purposefully).

Edit: I also wanted to say Gemma Chan and the rest of the cast were great, but Angelina Jolie was wasted, and her story should’ve been cut entirely.",qn0q4y
hjdu5a7,"Definitely had weird pacing issues. I normally can deal with this kind of thing and brush it off but good god Sprite's actress had some terrible line reads. Her lines just really stuck out like a sore thumb every time she spoke and kept taking me out of the movie.

The whole team just felt kind of ehh, didn't really feel the chemistry flow properly between all of them, save for maybe Sersi, Kingo and Makkari.

I really liked the Hiroshima bit, honestly would have loved to see more of Phastos' guilt over enabling Humanity to create mass destruction via giving them technology. The concepts of letting humanity destroy themselves while simultaneously also showing potential for good and eventually leading to the formation of the Avengers and saving the literal universe I found the most interesting in the movie but it was only lightly touched on.",qn0q4y
hjfauhj,"The problem is that the ""bad guys"" are infinitely more relatable than the ""good guys"". Ikaris is willing to sacrifice what he loves (but not Sersei), incluing himself to continue life in the universe. Whereas the ""good guys"" are like ""I don't want do die, I don't want my family to die"", ((basically ""fuck the universe"")). Also, they showed us for the whole movie why humanity is bad (genocide, massacre, Hiroshima), an now, they are like, ""humanity has to be saved"", why? Why humanity and not all the other worlds? Also, why the good guys are basically taking pleasure in hurting\\killing the bad guys (think about the line ""I always wanted to clip your wings Ikaris"", when they know they aren't truly bad but they are just working for a different goal. Also the bad guys show remorse, think about Ikaris after killing the leader... or Sprite being ""sorry"" at the end. And why, for the love of god, Sersie seems to be unfaced by the suicide of Ikaris.

That last bit is important, because I think that’s what’s solidified this as Marvels Batman V. Superman. All the shit you see Snyder fans say about that movie, get ready to hear that for this movie. About how audiences ‘didn’t understand’ such a deep film and that it was ‘too smart and complex’ for simple-minded people to enjoy. 

I’m just calling it as I see this. The rhetoric around this movie from its staunch supporters will be just as annoying as the rhetoric around BvS was by Snyder supporters, for the exact same reasons. Book it",qn0q4y

hjd6jji,"I really disliked this movie. I actually ended up walking out right after the Hiroshima scene. It was far too long and it violated the ""show don't tell"" trope constantly. I felt like it was trying to tell (not show) us how epic it was but I was consistently underwhelmed. Nothing was visually that enjoyable and felt like overdone tropes. 

I thought the historical throw backs were cheesy and cheaply done. It just felt so thoroughly uninteresting. I wasn't invested in any character and part of the reason I walked out is because I really didn't care about the ending and I'd rather have the hour back. 

I'm normally not a huge Marvel person so was hoping this would be more my style. Definitely not. Maybe I'm unfairly comparing the length and visuals to Dune, which I feel did much more with the same time and scope.",qn0q4y
hjdyikh,"Okay, here is my completely unbiased and objective review /s. Like most people on this sub, I'm a movie buff. Love em, and I absolutely love the MCU, so take what I saw with a grain of salt because fair warning: **this movie is divisive**. And everyone will have a different opinion. FAQ style review, because I think those are easier to digest and more fun to read.

&#x200B;

**Overall impression? Was it enjoyable for you?**

Short answer is yes. I thought the movie was good. Not great. Good. On my tier list for MCU films, I would say Eternals makes the cut for top 50% of marvel films. Which isn't saying a lot, btw, because I think most of the marvel films are either satisfactory or good, with a few great ones sprinked in there. Rarely is there a bad marvel film, the only ones I can truly think of are Iron Man 2 and possibly Thor: The Dark World. Eternals lands itself in the ""good"" category for me, meaning it was enjoyable, memorable, and something I would consider watching again when it comes out on Disney Plus.

For reference, here is an example of my ""rankings/tier list"" of marvel films (not all films included)

Great - Endgame, GOTG, BP, Winter Soldier

Good - Ragnarok, Eternals, Civil War, Ironman 3, Shang Chi

Satisfactory - Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Age of Ultron

Bad - Thor TDW, Ironman 2

Trash - None so far

&#x200B;

**Why is it divisive - Expectations and Reality**

The reason Eternals is divisive is because critics and viewers don't know if what they're watching is formulaic or not. Marvel films have made a rep for themselves as being formulaic - stick to the marvel secret sauce and their films become guaranteed hits. People generally think the formula looks something like this - Action packed comedy featuring loveable, redeemable protagonists that overcome their flaws to defeat the villain in a story that connects soundly and impactfully with the overall MCU. Most MCU films have been like this, and people just **don't know what to label Eternals as, at least collectively, because everyone seems to be either saying opposite things.**

Some people say it's too formulaic and some people think it's totally reinventing the wheel. I think if you've seen the film, it's easy to see why. **You either come out liking the film or disliking it, I don't think there's room for a middle ground in ""satisfactory"" - it's either good or bad.** I haven't seen anyone describe it as trash or great, nor have I seen many people describe it as mediocre/satisfactory. Good or bad.

Whether you expected/wanted formula will depict how you feel about this film. If you wanted formula and found it too different, you would be disappointed. If you didn't want formula and found it too formulaic, you would be disappointed. **You can make a case for either at the end of the day, which is why reviews are all over the place.**

&#x200B;

**What do I think? Formula or Fresh Air?**

For me, the movie was a breath of fresh air. I don't think it was formulaic, but I can see why some people may think it was. For me, Eternals was a drama, not a superhero film, which is why it was so enjoyable to watch for me. I didn't want to see formula, I wanted to see something new from a new group of heroes. And like I said, the way Zhao decided to focus on interpersonal relationships and group dynamics was awesome for me. Eternals had low levels of comedy and little action scenes (although still very present and noticeable) and higher levels of emotional scenes, rich dialogue, exposition and serious undertones. Like I said, it felt more like a drama, a story about loyalty, betrayal and morals rather than a superhero film. I enjoyed being able to explore the motivations, emotions, and desires of each character that manifested itself into problems, solutions and drama within the group. Sprite was in love with Ikaris which made her blindly follow him, Sersi was too emotionally attached to humans which went against her directive from Arisham. Ikaris was too loyal to Arisham to think for himself or develop a personal moral compass. Kingo hated conflict and just wanted to spread love, which lead to inaction. And being able to flesh out (to varying degrees ofc) each eternal was fun for me, it made me feel more connected to the issues that arose despite not having a connection with each character from previous MCU adaptations. **Oh, and the CGI was awesome without distracting from the vision of the movie. Acting was good, characters all felt ""real"" and relatable. Fight scenes were exciting and aesthetic, very fast paced as always.** Very cinematic, which is suprisingly rare for marvel films. **World building was awesome for the MCU, very excited for what's to come. All this cosmic crap is a wet dream for marvel fans.** Bolded stuff in this paragraph is formula stuff, which may shed light on what I was trying to say earlier about the film being divisive.

&#x200B;

**What about the negative?**

Lots of negative parts of this movie though that definitely goes without warrant. Here's a list.

\- Kro was wasted. All the deviants were just a subplot. Mindless beasts with a leader full of villain potential that was merked randomly at the end.

\- Ajak (Salma Hayek) was wasted. Thena too. Their characters felt too shallow and one-dimensional. Ajak was the ""for your own good mother"" that conveniently couldn't defend herself at all despite being in the biz for millenia. Thena was the ocassionally badass warrior woman that also happened to be psycho for the sake of making the audience go ""OHHH that's why she was like that"" later in the movie. Meh.

\- Kit Harrington's character was wasted. Beginning and end for maybe 5 mins of total screen time? Yikes. We get it, black knight and stuff but his involvement should've been more impactful.

\- Evil Superman trope. Been overdone recently, and honestly anything that isn't Homelander is just bad at this point. Not saying that I didn't like Ikaris, I thought he was awesome, and his motivations and personality were totally different than most evil supermen, but did it HAVE to be Ikaris that turned? Just felt a little bit, derivative, you know?

\- Twist was decent, but the overall plot was pretty simple. They needed to expand on the deviants a little more or at least make them more important to the overall story - a lot of the time they just felt like an inconvenience, not apex predators.

\- Overall, the movie felt jam packed with too much stuff going on, which lead to pacing issues. Could have benefitted from less exposition and a faster first act.

&#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**

Okay, I'm tired. Going to bed. Overall, good movie. I thought the good outweighed the bad. I'm gonna rip off a review from some critic and paraphrase the following cuz I think it's a good way to summarize the cesspool of reactions to Eternals:

Whether you thought Eternals was good or bad, there's no doubt that phase 4 is off to an exciting start.",qn0q4y
hje950a,It's not bad. Just dull. This is one of those mcu films I'm fine with having watched once then never again. None of the Eternals really grabbed me enough to make me care about where their characters go or if they appear again. I know they probably will but I'm not hyped to see them again or anything.,qn0q4y
hjf56d6,Got big FMA vibes while watching Eternals. Sersi's use of transmutation reminded of how Edward uses of alchemy without a transmutation circle.,qn0q4y
hjmmnku,Feel Sersi was miscast. Gemma just doesn't have that wow factor to be the lead in a superhero film. Having two big GOT actors also threw me off. Especially when the both meet.,qn0q4y
hkkodw4,"This is probably the worst marvel film since Thor 2. Far too long, slow, too many characters to develop. I thought the bollywood reference was just poor (is that all India is known for?).",qn0q4y
hsmbsl3,"This sucks. 

I'm 95 minutes in and I'm turning it off. I've got no frame of reference for deviants or any of this bullshit, and the movie just drudges along with scene after scene of new characters being introduced. 

Only now over half way through the film is it revealing some dumb twist that the big bosses are secretly bad guys. The amount of times ""present day"" pops up on screen is kind of embarrassing, just makes the whole thing feel stupid. 

The film has no core. Nothing to ground it. Nothing to entertain you. Nothing to latch onto. Nothing to wow you. The visuals are competent but uninspiring. The dialogue is stilted and lifeless, the characters are either entirely bland or mildly annoying spouting gobbledygook exposition. 

This was exactly as poor as I hoped it wouldn't be. It's bland and bullshitty. There's nothing here to even hate, there's just nothing here.",qn0q4y
hjdvyqe,"The movie is trying to do too many things at once. It’s not terrible, not at all, it’s just got way too much going on so a lot of ideas aren’t fulfilled to their potential. The stuff in the past is far more interesting than the present stuff, I wish we could see THAT as a feature  length movie instead.

The biggest problem with this movie is that it has waaaaay too many characters. You really don’t feel any connection to them at all. This is literally problem numero uno for me and it’s surprising because even the worst marvel movies usually get this right. If I had one major problem about this movie, it’s that you don’t feel connected to anyone because it all moves so fast and there’s so many characters.

Like, when Selma Hayek dies I was thinking ‘damn, slow down movie!’ It’s so abrupt and a lot of the movie is so abrupt and thus the characters don’t reach their full potential.

But that stuff in the past is so un-marvel like and so neat, I really, really wished they just focused on that. That stuff was great. Or just eliminate that to focus on the characters in the present.

It’s not a terrible movie and I appreciate it for trying to be different. Speedster and Druig were the highlights. Big Deviant dude and concepts behind the eternals creation was really neat. But they really needed to cut down on the amount of characters and focus on a smaller group of them",qn0q4y
hjk3icv,"This was the weakest recent entry in the MCU by far, right up there with 'Dark World'.

I didn't connect with any of the characters, the lore, the visuals. A colossal misfire by Marvel, too high on their own supply to recognize the project would be a flop. 

My enthusiasm for this franchise is much more muted than it used to be. The future is not looking so hot for the MCU, with the original Avengers either dead or retired.",qn0q4y
hjdqtwk,"Honestly, there were moments of greatness throughout the film, but so much was undercut by the script's attempts at being more important than it actually is. Some scenes felt like they were flying high, while others were chained down by self-obsession, and the flashbacks/exposition hurt so much more than it helped.

My guess is that a lot has to do with Zhao's personality clashing with Marvel's, rather than the two meshing. The original writers were the Firpos, who are action-comedy, while Zhao is more melodrama, and you could see that sometimes from moment to moment.

It honestly felt like a low budget sundance film with a 200m budget, and I mean that as both a compliment and an insult.",qn0q4y
hje073v,"I was actually very surprised by this movie. I expected to be disappointed because of the critic's score but this movie felt so refreshing to me. Doesn't have many quips, I felt the characters had deep conflicts, not your typical villain, etc. It does have some pacing issues but overall, I liked it better than most films in Phase 3 and 4 so far. 8.5/10 for me.",qn0q4y
hjqe4kn,"Anyone else feel like this was a DC movie? It felt like Justice League, like they just mashed everything together like they used to in the pre-MCU days. 

There was zero pacing and the character development was just piss poor. I didn’t give a shit when any of these characters got hurt or even died. Didn’t give a crap about the love story. None of it was earned. 

Everything was explained poorly instead of shown to the audience.",qn0q4y
hjqnq7x,"I really have no idea what they're setting up in the MCU right now, it's so weird to have so many people introduced that I've never even heard of but will play a big role going forward. Idk how to feel about all this, as of right now I really don't feel much of a connection to any of this but maybe that will change. I have to imagine they're losing tons of people though. I know a pretty hardcore MCU fan that hasn't seen anything since WandaVision. The only reason I'm watching at this point is because I'm a movie guy with an unlimited pass and a lot of disposable time lol. Take away any of those factors and I wouldn't be there.",qn0q4y
hkhc4pt,"I think I liked only two people out of the whole cast: Druig and Phastos.

The rest of the Eternals were, mostly, horrible human beings  and about as uninteresting as it gets. Technically they're not humans, but beyond the point.

As for the movie itself, I'd say it was bad. Probably the most boring MCU movie in years. It was set piece after set piece, go to hero A, fight scene, go to hero B, fight scene, hero C, fight, rinse and repeat until final fight sequence.

Hell, I think I've enjoyed fucking Justice League more than this thing. But that could be because I forgot all about Justice League (probably for the better).

hk7srrx,"Sadly this movie sucked.... The pace was wrong, the character reaction to the events were wrong and inconsistent, Sersi's character showed the range of emotions Darth Vader has with his mask on....

Makkari was awesome, Ikaris did an awesome job as well... The rest of the characters were all bleh

Some special effects were great... The big space scenes, the black hole in the end

Completely drop the bag on the deviants plot... What a wasted opportunity for an awesome antihero race to drive into the next movies

After credit scene was ridiculous, Pip looked like a high school project

Overall I think Marvel got complacent and figured they'd make money no matter what... This was, at best, a DC quality movie.... Firmly my list favorite of the MCU",qn0q4y

hjdmarl,I liked it. Didn’t think it warrants a 50% on RT but it’s definitely a movie I think would’ve been better as a D+ series so we could learn more about each Eternal.,qn0q4y
hjyz69i,"Why did they even make this movie? These characters feel like the Inhumans in that they suck and there's too many of them to give a fuck about. 


If Marvel wanted to use them, they should've had the Eternals start showing up in the other movies, nixed the origin story movie completely, and had them act more like beings who've been around for thousands of years. THEN drop the Celestial bomb somewhere down the line and blow people's minds.",qn0q4y
hjpkj0k,"I just don’t get it. I’m writing literally at the end credit right now. I feel it’s one of the best marvel movies, 8.5/10, still Thor Ragnarok is the best for me. 

I’m not a marvel diehard, just movie buff. Watched all of them, just because I go to the movies once or twice (or three times) every weekend (thanks AMC A LIST)

Went in knowing the RT scores, so I guess that lowered my expectations a bit, but honestly I never care about critics.

- Visually stunning, felt huge and grand
- Honestly was emotionally invested throughout

hjeh1v4,"After having watching it a few days ago, I have decided what I would have done differently with the film. I liked the presentation but didn't feel it matched the story and it should have been leaning further into the mystery genre. 

There are a few genuinely good reveals that aren't really handled as twists in the vein of a Fincher film or something like Soylent Green or Planet of the Apes. Done differently they could have genuinely been genuine ""Oh shit"" moments.

There first act should treat ""Who really killed Ajak?"" as a genuine mystery meanwhile discovering that Deviants are actually alive. Keep the ""Big Chill"" style reuniting after the death of a friend plus flashbacks leading to their separation.

While defeating the Deviants they find out that the main one also absorbed Ajak's ability to speak to Arishem. After they defeat it=, Sersi gains this power and discovers the truth about Arishem's plans. Arishem was angered when the Deviant spoke to him and triggered the Emergence as it turns out they were only reducing the population for ""the greater good"".

Sersi reveals this to the group only to discover that Ikaris knew and actually killed Ajak framing the Deviants. Reveal also explains how he found them frozen earlier and only defrosted them when it became useful for him unaware one had developed the absorption power. 

Cue final battle. Deviants already defeated so no confusion as to final Deviant's motivation in final battle. Personally I would have had Sersi kill Ikaris for the drama and the rest stopping the Emergence another way.

I really enjoyed the idea of these big reveals but don't think they were executed very well. I didn't find myself too shocked compared to the way other films were able to. I know I essentially just described the plot however I hope you are picturing the plot points in the vein of a noir mystery which I think would have made things more interesting.

A recent film I think did pretty well in blending the Mystery genre into something else was Blade Runner 2049 which hit each reveal very well.",qn0q4y

I'm loving the idea of Galactus showing up now since the Celestials are finally being recognized. Also, I liked how we got a backstory of how the Eternals were created and their purpose. People were complaining because the movie was too detailed but it was fine with me as I knew nothing about them.

How on earth can a Marvel movie trip so hard over the hurdles the other MCU movies managed to expertly leap over? You introduce the individual characters BEFORE HAND, so you can focus on the TEAM aspect in the team movie.

The humor was so much better than in other Marvel movies. It never felt like it was undercutting a dramatic moment or was an overlong improvisation. Character moments are allowed to happen without the need to immediately lighten the mood with a joke. There is tons of humor, but I thought it was weaved in better than most Marvel movies. 

I actually was interested to see what the other members of the Eternals were getting up to. Visually it looks amazing and wonky CGI was at a minimum. Final act is clumsy, but what else is new. 

Overall I really enjoyed the movie.",qn0q4y
hjd7cqj,I really wanted to like it but this was an absolute slog. Felt longer than its already lengthy runtime and seemed to never figure out where to straddle the line on MCU formula versus something new.,qn0q4y

hjdr9jr,"this film was pretty awful, I didn't hate it, it's not offensively bad like the last jedi but god damn how was this script greenlit? It was just so boring. It is funny though to see the fallout from bad reviews on the marvelstudios subreddit lmao",qn0q4y
hjd6jbv,I loved it. I won't go any more into it because I know people just want their action popcorn flicks with tons of nonsense comedy at inappropriate times. And I get that. They're fun too. It was just so nice to see an MCU movie that wasn't so egregious with the comedy and that actually took something seriously.,qn0q4y
hjj7pse,"The worst marvel movies are dumb, formulaic and uninspiring but still entertaining at the end of the day. This was the first marvel film which bored me all the way through. 

This was incredibly dull and characters were lifeless. I did like the moral quandary but it was hard to bring myself to care about it all. It's not helped by the fact that it's too long for its own good.",qn0q4y

hjicq6i,"Overall, my feelings are mixed. Because I like to end on a good note, I’ll start with the **Bad**:

- The movie had too many villains. Arishem, Ikaris, the one sentient deviant. It was too much. I would’ve cut the sentient deviant to make the conflict more focused.
- The twist was painfully obvious because Arishem’s visual and auditory cues were blatantly sinister. It would have been more interesting if he was actually portrayed in a positive light pre-twist.
- None of the characters were bad, *per se*, but it did feel like they didn’t have enough time to develop them all. If not for the great production values, I’d think this would work better as a miniseries.
- In particular, this was a problem with Ikaris. He got more focus than anyone other than Sersi, but for the central villain, it still wasn’t enough. His motivations felt underbaked. It wasn’t clear why he was so dead-set on awakening the celestial other than a generic “well, it’s my job, gotta be loyal to Arishem”. Then, having him only realize he couldn’t kill Sersi after looking her in the eyes felt cheap. His love for Sersi is the most explicit thing about his character, so wouldn’t he realize that earlier?
- The ending was weird on multiple levels. First off, they say the awakening celestial joined their Unimind. So did it help sacrifice itself? Is it still alive in some way? The cliffhanger ending felt too sudden, and the final shot focusing on Kit Harrington is confusing to anyone not familiar with the character from the comics.
- Directly referencing a DC hero, by name, in a Marvel movie feels really awkward.

Now for the **Good**:

- I like that they actually acknowledged the flaws in the Eternals’ non-interventionist philosophy, instead of taking it for granted. I would’ve liked a deeper exploration of the the ethics of interventionism vs. non-interventionism, but I get that the movie was already doing a lot.
- Most of the performances were good. Only Sprite’s actress really bothered me.
- I liked the “side-character” Eternals like Druig and Makkari. Makkari in particular was an enjoyable charcter whenever she was around. It was great to see a deaf character be given so much personality.
- The action scenes were clear and well-shot, and seeing the characters use their powers to fight in their own ways was pretty cool.
- The production values of the historical scenes were very good. A big part of me wishes that, instead of most of the plot taking place in the modern day, the plot would’ve stretched across human history. But that’s my history nerd self talking.
- A lot of the movie was very beautiful and made great use of color, which was helped by the “globe-trotting” nature of the film.

So, a lot of good, a lot of bad. I need more time for the movie to stew in my brain, but I enjoyed it, so it was worth the ticket.",qn0q4y
hjijmdl,"I don't think it deserves to be the lowest rated Marvel movie (Thor: the Dark World is still the worst in my opinion) but I can easily see why a lot of critics didn't enjoy. 

My main criticism is not that the movie is long but that it ""feels"" long because its kinda boring at times and gets lost in its own plot. If they trimmed the cast down to maybe 4 or 5 Eternals instead of a whopping 10, I think it might've helped. Most of the movie is just the Eternals catching up with one another and debating if they should help humanity plus some flashbacks. After an hour and half or so into the movie, the discussions then become can they fight back against a celestial then the in-fighting starts which then overshadows the initial conflict of the movie of Eternal vs Deviant which has no real payoff.

It wasn't intentionally funny but I laughed when the big bad Deviant shows up during the Ikaris beach fight. He shows up, picks a fight with Thena, they fight in a cave, he thinks he's restrained her and then she just suddenly slices him up like some cartoon swordsman lol. I'm pretty sure Deviants are never mentioned again after that scene.",qn0q4y

hjhhi0r,"Is there some sort of grand Marvel delusion going on here? The movie was shallow, dull trash. I loved Zhao’s previous films but was utterly disappointed. The recurring comparisons with Dune here are apt because these releases are weeks apart and have the same run time. They have the same run time! And both have those Malick moments - but one is earned, the other empty.",qn0q4y
hjdjeoo,"I wanted to like it and I did enjoy the visuals and some of the performances (Jolie, Madden, Harington, and the actor who played Druig were the standouts for me), but I thought the writing and pacing was really bad. Too facile. It didn't really bring anything too original or special to the franchise, and it just lacked a spark. A disappointment",qn0q4y
hjdycx3,"Having a dead Celestial in the middle of the Indian Ocean and just having to deal with it, is the most comics shit ever, I love it. 

Overall I really enjoyed it! I'm a big MCU fan so maybe that's to be expected but I liked seeing the Eternals throughout history and seeing how these aliens influenced humanity. Which is pretty accurate to the comic. And I liked seeing how everyone was trying to live with humanity differently. Especially with how casual Dane is with dating an immortal robot. It's very comic booky. And Gemma Chan is stunning so maybe that helped.

And while it has to introduce too many characters I enjoyed them all. But it is a bit too much in that I kept wondering how Makkari was going to be introduced so late and she's just chilling on the Domo. Which is a fun character bit (she's just like Sonic apparently) but is very light. 

I do think the Deviants hurt the pacing of the movie more than help (really liked the historical battles with them though) but it was interesting having this angels and demon dynamic with them. You could see what they were going for but it doesn't do enough to make you care about Kro. Yes he has a name. No I don't think anyone should bother knowing it. Even me the nerd. 

Also he killed Gilgamesh so fuck him.",qn0q4y

hjemhlx,"I said to my wife when it ended. “Thank Christ, that was awful”. I have no idea if I am getting a bit 2 old now, or I don’t understand or know the backstory at all. The best bit of the movie for me was Jon Snow, and I liked the speedy girl, she was cool. I saw someone say they would have liked this in a show and I think that is what they should have done, just not a good movie for me but hey, hindsight is a hell of a thing.",qn0q4y
hjdnf4c,"Probably the weakest MCU movie since Iron Man 2, what a letdown for something that was so heavily advertised as being Marvel's take on high cinema. The dialogue was abysmal where everyone just said exactly what was on their mind in the most simplistic way imaginable. 

The plot was completely screwed over in the editing room since everything was told in a completely random, coherent order that didn't allow us to develop a connection with any of the characters. The pacing was either too fast at the beginning where everything happened at breakneck speed or too slow like in the middle where everything felt three hours long. 

Even without these glaring issues the movie probably still wouldn't have worked because the plot is literally just Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 meets Rise of the Silver Surfer. What a waste of what could've been a perfect live action Galactus on Arishem who isn't a fraction as good of a character. The Deviants are just generic CGI monsters, Kro was even worse than Malekith. 

It's not completely unwatchable though, the on set visuals and cinematography look really good and it's clear the cast is _trying_ to work with what they're given. Like I said before, Arishem would've been a great Galactus so every scene with him was fun. The end credit scenes teasing Starfox, Black Knight, and Blade were also superb, probably my favorite parts of the whole movie come to think about it. 

Other than that, Eternals seems to have perfectly captured everything bad about Marvel but none of what's good.",qn0q4y

hjnpaab,"I’ve watched the MCU from the very beginning and of the 20+ films, there’s maybe 3 that I truly dislike. I’m adding Eternals to that list. That’s 2/3 releases this year that are just poor films IMO (this and Black Widow). 

There’s others I dislike more like Thor 2, but I think this was the most bored I’ve ever been watching an MCU film. 2.5 hours and there’s so many pointless scenes that don’t add to anything at all. I found it hard to get invested in really any of the Eternals, they are either completely bland or just plain unlikeable (Makkari was the exception for me) There’s no advancement in the story until the last half hour, and once you finally get there it’s hard to be invested because it’s just another generic CGI end of the world battle. Their storytelling method here would worked way way better in a Disney+ series, instead it made a jumbled, hard to follow mess of a movie. 

I feel like if this movie had any name other than Marvel on it it would be a complete bomb",qn0q4y

hk1gg9b,Towards the end of the movie I started hoping they’d all just kill each other so we’d never have to see any of them again.,qn0q4y
hjdojkd,"- Makkari vs Ikaris was sick.

- Where was the volcano at the end? No location card was given, best guess is off the coast of Chile, seen when Ikaris flew off Earth and looked down.

- Didn’t really care when Ajax died, cared a little more when I saw how.

- Seeing Don Lee deliver megaton punches was cool, hope they can multiverse him back again.

- I do like them going through all the different points in history, but it did make the movie feel a bit choppy.

- Why did Kingo just peace out before the end? That was weird.

- Harry Styles! And Blade!

- Cinematography was gorgeous, the celestial memory banks, the volcano, the celestials, and so much more.

Overall, 7/10. Not one of Marvel’s best but I enjoyed it well enough:",qn0q4y

What I can appreciate is that this feels like a real shift in the MCU stakes in line with all the crazy multiverse stuff going on. Everything feels more metaphysical and just grander than phase 3, which is dope to see. So when I take that into account, i really liked this movie.

That said, it dragged in the middle at times and the CGI often looked pretty bad.",qn0q4y

hjmynff,"I gotta say, I was pleasantly surprised. I thought this movie was going to suck but I really enjoyed it. It's not without it's problems, though. 

I thought Angelina Jolie was incredibly distracting visually when on screen. There was one scene where she was laying unconscious on a table that was supposed to be taken seriously, but her fake lips were just so huge and ridiculous I just couldn't help but chuckle. 

I otherwise loved the casting but it just didn't make sense to me that a divine being would create a servant that was deaf. I suppose she doesn't need hearing with her powers of detecting vibrations, but it just seems like a detrimental move on the Celestial's part. Wouldn't you want them all to have every advantage over the Deviants as possible? But that character was awesome and was easily the coolest in combat, so not a real problem at all. Just a weird bit to me. 

~~Also in hindsight, I think it was a bad idea to use the word ""Deviant"" to describe a type of character in ""Loki"" if this movie was already planned to have a villain creature called Deviants.~~ 
EDIT: I'm wrong and dumb. Whoops. Sorry!

But I LOVED how worldly this movie was. I loved how there were so many different languages and culture present, and I loved how they made the world seem so small. That's how eternal, larger-than-life beings would view our planet, so it was cool to see that reflected in the settings. Bouncing around from locations on opposite ends of the Earth in no time flat really made the planet seem small to me.

I loved how talk-y this movie was. The cast did a great job with it. The plot wasn't so black and white, good or bad. It was very grey. It was nice to see that coming from a Marvel flick.

I felt this was a better Justice League movie than Justice League was.",qn0q4y

hjty1nj,"the good: thena, ikarus, ajak, kingo, makrai, druiga, phastos and family. more of them please. the special effects were well done. the birth of a celestrial was also a highlight conceptually and exection wise

the bad; sersi as lead was boring. her love triangle had no heat or chemistry. the movie felt flat in some places and didn't have much tension for a world ending threat. the deviants needed more development. too many eternals crowded out any serious chraracter deveopment. no thena gilgamesh romance? way to throw asian men under the bus... again. the eternals sure did speak with modern colloquisms even when showing up 50000 bc.... and to that point they didn't feel like they existed for thousands of years on earth. hell my grandma had more wisdowm maturity and insight than all of them at 90 let alone 7090. did their robot nature keep them stagnant?  did their eternal youth keep them rooted in the present firmly? sprite your body looks like a teen but your mind is not. she should have been played as an adult maybe bitter and jaded instead of as a saracastic tween.

the weird; robots... so thanos was a robot... this whole robot thing was so unnecessary. the celestials as god... meh....also it took so much to bring thanos down and yet the eternals seemed so fragile in comparison. the reveal of starfox yay but wasn't feeling the actor at all. oh and who was that voice with teh black knight/",qn0q4y

hjv72v0,"So I can't say this movie is disappointing because I had such low expectations for it. It however did not match even my lowest bar for enjoyment.

I was so on board when I heard they were going to have more of an art film aesthetic than blockbuster action film. However I didn't realise that meant ripping any fun from the proceedings too.

I have seen people say at least it was well shot which I can't agree with. No single image sticks out in my mind and it feels like the entire movie took place in an empty field or on a beach.

The actors all underplayed everything which I completely attribute to the Director. Coming from an indie background she clearly wanted to attack it from a place of reality however this is not a real universe. This is literally comics on screen, everything should be heightened. This doesn't mean there has to be a quip every 5 seconds but people need to express at a higher level, positive or negative emotions. This led to me feeling like every actor was in a different film and they didn't really understand what they were doing.

There's no villian to speak of which again not necessarily a problem but they spend so unbelievably long dealing with exposition that I began to forget there was a problem they were facing.

All in all, I'm glad people have enjoyed this film. I wish I could have been one of them.",qn0q4y

First of all, as an anthropology nerd I hated the historical inconsistencies. I know its a movie, buuuut it just bothered me. Second, the were using modern language (like yup, sure etc.) In Mesopotamia???? One of the girls also had a modern earring on.

I also thought the romance between Cersei and Icarus was bizarre. They all kept going on about how they were family and they basically have the same creator. They even all saw Ajax as a mother figure, calling Icarus, ""mother's favorite."" Yet they still fucked? 

The final battle was so anti-climatic. I wanted to see a fight between Icarus and Cersei but it ended with...him breaking down crying? 

Also, some of the characters felt totally useless. 

Finally, the acting was also horrendous.

The story doesn’t make sense. There is no arc to the characters . The sex scene was unnecessary and uncomfortable. The love angle was stretched out .

hjdi7q1,"Okay this wasn't as bad as RT says - I'd have given it a 70% - but the contradictory critics were right on the money: there's both too much going on and not enough going on at the same time. It definitely feels aimless.

Random thoughts:

- Thena's storyline was a bit of a mess and didn't really go anywhere except to incapacitate a crucial fighter to keep the stakes high. Angelina is the premier female action hero of a generation, and she should have had some better writing. Loved the return of the *Girl Interrupted* blonde look, though.
- As much as I like seeing both Patton Oswalt and Pip the Troll, that was some atrocious CGI and I'm not sure I'm a fan of that casting. Maybe Guardians 3 or the Holiday Special will convince me otherwise.
- Does Chloe Zhao have a blood pact with the South Dakotan government that demands she have the state in every film?
- Gilgamesh was a crowd favorite in my showing. It's a pity his screentime was minimal but he is called the ""Forgotten One"" though. I liked that the Babylon Deviant he fought resembled the Bull of Heaven. Actually there were a lot of great mythological references in this flick, so props to the research team.
- I had a serious issue with Ikaris. He is obviously the latest victim of Phase Four's adoration of awful twists, but the fact that they chose the one Eternal whose comic counterpart is considered a paragon of virtue is not remotely as clever as they seem to think, and actually rather insulting to a comic fan, especially since such a twist was telegraphed before the movie came out (honestly as far back as the casting announcements in 2019 at Comic-Con and D23). I can't be the only one tired of the ""what if Superman was evil?"" trope.
- Harry Styles is a *chef's kiss* choice for Starfox. But it was painfully obvious that he wasn't in the same room as the others when they filmed that credits scene.
- The biggest issue this has is simply the fact that there's so much potential wasted. Waste of the Deviants as fascinating characters, waste of Warlord Kro (and Bill Skarsgard by extension), waste of hiring Salma Hayek in the first place for such a minimal role. I'm sure I'll think of others upon reflection, but this was definitely my first feeling when the credits rolled. I'm sure I'm not alone.

The other thing is, Dane mentioned to Sersi something about his uncle during a phone chat.

So Arisham was the one to send the deviants to kill off the apex predators (just killing machines, not so smart ones) so another smart species can evolve and populate whose population will be useful later on to give birth to a celestial and kill off all life on the planet in the process. And those deviants after killing apex ones, they themselves become apex and start killing. And then send eternals to wipe out deviants, and then after celestial is born, wipe out eternals memories and then repeat cycle on another planet.

My question is why send deviants in the first place? If they are going to cause trouble, just send the eternals to finish off the apex predator ones and then switch them off. YOU program them anyway. Or at least give them a mission of killing off the apex ones and then tell them you're done and wipe out their memories and send them to another planet to do another mission.",qn0q4y

The last fights had a lot of interesting powers in play that were undermined by poor CGI models for people and a really ambiguous set of stakes (sometimes Eternals can land on their feet after being thrown from the top of a cliff, sometimes a rock knocks one out or a normal knife can wound them). 

The worst part was that heroes literally kill a newborn, especially since they established that Durigg could use his powers to stop it peacefully. I was expecting them to distract Ikaris with some clever gambit to let Druigg do his thing or for Gemma Chan to use a really clever use of her power to trap or communicate with Tiamut, but no, they kill one of their gods and they don't seem to really be troubled by it.

Definitely not the best Marvel movie to date. But definitely not the worst for me either. Probably somewhere in the middle. I liked it more than Black Widow, Iron Man 2 & 3, Dark World, and The First Avenger - just to give an idea where my taste falls. 

It suffered from having a few too many characters with not a lot for them to do for a good chunk of the middle of the movie. Had a lot of exposition while we rounded up a lot of the team. Movie would've benefited from maybe just having 7, maybe 8 max, Eternals in this first one. Then maybe bringing in a few more in a sequel. Make the team round up quicker with fewer time jumps would've helped with the pacing.

hkk393n,"Just saw this film. It wasn't as terrible as how critics we're putting it out there, but it was not as good as other Marvel films like Avengers: Infinity War or GOTG. I thoroughly enjoyed it and knew very little about the Eternals, aside from what the Celestials and Deviants were, but I kind of felt the last half of the movie was a bit rushed. The fight with Ikaris was great, but the part with the deviant was a bit underdeveloped and wished we got to see more of him. I also don't get how critics mentioned that there is a lack of character development in this movie, when I felt that each character had a moment to share the spotlight, even Karun! Other than that, it was a very different film compared to other MCU films and felt fresh to see them try something new that we haven't seen in other superhero films. 

Also, might be just my opinion, but to me, this definitely feels like a Batman V Superman situation where the film will be polarizing among critics and fans.",qn0q4y
hkn23p2,"I feel pretty mixed. Some good, some bad. I generally watch the new Marvel movies in theaters at some point during their run, but I don't read any of comics or watch any of the tv shows so not sure if I'm missing context. 

Pros: 

* I've read a lot of reviews bashing the character development but I actually felt like that was a stronger point of the movie. Besides Angelina Jolie and Sprite (who I'll touch upon later) I thought the Eternals were all fleshed out pretty well with their own motivations. 

* I actually did dig the ""ancient aliens"" story set-up. Of them guiding mankind along the way. I don't really care about them handwaving Thanos tbh. They were going to have to do it anyways, and being barred from interfering from some cosmic god is a good enough Marvel reason I guess. Also for people saying they should have been commanded to stop Thanos because of the celestial plan, the snap basically set humanity back from reaching enough people by 60 years. A blink of the eye for the eternals. 

* Loved the gold aesthetics of the eternals and their powers. 

* Brian Tyree Henry and Lauren Ridloff were both great! They added a lot of humanity (lol) to the story in their own ways. Really loved both of their performances. 

Cons:

* Runtime... wtf. Why does this movie need to be over 2 and a half hours? 

* Angelina Jolie's character just kinda bored me. I get what they were going for, but the execution just fell flat for me. 

* Sprite's character arc made no sense to me. Isn't the whole point of her story is that she's a 5 thousand year old super-being in a kid's body? Why does she act like a kid half the time? The betrayal just felt way too out of left field for me. She literally stabs Sirsi in the back after living with her for hundreds of years because she has a crush on Icarus? 

* Deviants.... Bleh. Cool designs I guess, but I feel like Marvel just continuously shoves in some token CGI monster of the month to pad time for action scenes. Also when they get to the island of the emergence I honestly thought they were gonna team up with the Deviants to stop Icarus but no, Angelina Jolie just has her 1v1 with him. Just fell super flat. 

All in all, a movie that I don't regret seeing on a quiet Sunday, but I can't help feeling a bit disappointed because with a few tweaks I felt this could have been really really good. To be honest I've felt this way about the last few Marvel movies though.",qn0q4y

The stakes felt pretty low for half the movie, Eternals didn't seem challenged at all by deviants. When Deviants actually became a challenge it felt like the Eternals abilities and tactics are wildly underdeveloped. The Deviant plot was wasted imo but i did find it very intriguing, the idea of a rapidly evolving superthreat. 

I understand Ikaris' disappointment, all that time just so the mission is aborted and you lose your loved ones all while failing to do the one thing you were focused on your whole ""existance"" on earth.

Deviants started evolving, so Eternals were created.

Eternals have been around for millions of years, thus thousands? of planets.

Did all the planets in the universe get seeded at the same time with Deviants (first cycle ever), and thus ALL the planets needed Eternals?

Once it was known Deviants evolved, they stopped sending them to planets... so wouldn't Earth have not had deviants, as they had been doing this for millions of years, and Earth was the latest?",qn0q4y

It had some interesting ideas and I appreciated the use of natural light and real sets in most sequences (although the CGI monsters sucked), but it was so generic and formulaic. And unlike most Marvel movies, it lacked action and didn't have a coherent narrative. Most characters were thinly written and their dynamic and motivations were poorly developed.

First thing I thought when I finished it is that it should've been a TV series. It had so much to do, basically an entire Avengers arc in a single movie. Just think about, the Avengers had plenty of solo films to develop the characters individually, two films to develop their dynamic, one film to provide some conflict between the heroes and two films where they finally faced the big guy.

hjzphom,"This movie sucked.

Couldn't decide on which conflict mattered the most (Eternals vs. Deviants, Eternals vs. Eternals or Eternals vs. Celestials), so none of them felt important at all. Add the issue with Thena's memories and >!Ikaris' heel turn!<, and we just have a pile of problems that spin in circles for a 2.5 hour runtime. The movie felt like it was continuously trying to justify its length by adding more shit in it before they figured out what to do with the rest of it. The Deviant plotline and CG villain was essentially meaningless to the overall story, which is not good when it's the only conflict that lasts through the entire movie. 

The pacing was basically non-existent. The moments when the movie chose to use its flashbacks really threw the viewer for a loop, and really didn't seem to add much at all to what was happening in the present.

Like another commenter on here said, I could not tell you one defining quality to Sersi's character besides the one we were spoonfed about how much she loves humans. 

I don't think any of this stacked cast brought their A-game, save for Barry Keoghan. For a group of actors that absolutely ooze charisma, he seemed to be the only one interested in using it. Richard Madden gives maybe the most wooden performance of his career.

Losing your two most likable characters before the grand finale is never a good thing. >!Gilgamesh dying and Kingo just deciding not to partake in the big fight!< left us with a very underwhelming group by the end. The former's need to happen in order to give Angelina Jolie something to do is also a super weak excuse for a character motivation.

Kit Harrington's character had literally zero reason to be in this movie. It legit felt like somebody at Marvel really wanted him to be this particular character, but they couldn't figure out how to fit him into any of the other established franchises organically, so they slapped him onto this one. It's a shame, because he has really charming moments, but it feels like 5ish minutes of dead space in the film.

I'll give it credit for not *looking* like a traditional Marvel movie. It actually does look like a film made by a director and cinematographer with vision, rather than the typical house style. I found Karun to be an absolute delight, and felt that Kumail injected a type of humor and personality unique among characters in Marvel movies. The Celestials looked incredibly imposing, and their appearances signaled the only ""wow"" moments of this movie for me. Ramin Djawadi's score was refreshing in that it was actively noticeable in a Marvel movie.

I think this was pretty bad. It was more of the same issues that continually have crept their way into Marvel movies over the last 5 years or so. No defining conflict, no compelling antagonist, a glut of phenomenal actors being directed relatively poorly, and an expectation that just because it's part of the MCU that we care about the story it's attempting to tell.

Post-Endgame, for me, they've been 0-3 on the big screen (FFH, BW and this. I haven't seen Shang-Chi yet) and middling on TV (WandaVision has 6 episodes of the best content they've put out in years, but trips at the finish line. Captain Falcon was rough, What If was hit or miss. Haven't seen Loki). Starting to really feel the fatigue and am wondering if they're finally losing steam.",qn0q4y
hjde8jq,"Just some thoughts

It has some really good ideas but I thought the dialogue was way too on the nose. Script felt really undercooked and just kinda spoonfed you the whole way.

- Richard was pretty much cardboard as everyone is saying, but man what the hell was Angelina Jolie then. Even character-wise she has no real depth and is there for what is easily the poorest plot point 

- Druig and Makkari are the standouts for me, Kumail is good but he's doing classic Marvel stuff, which still, works, and lets the film breathe a little.


- ""hey I have some energy left i can turn you into a human"" wtf what


- whole Black Knight stuff felt the most out of place and just thrown in there out of all the set ups


- after credits felt kind of a parody at this point with the bad CG and * famous person * just popping out


other than that I actually prefer they take some swings rather than keep making the usual origin formula, i think it hit in some places but it never quite got there fully. I like the conflict, I like the idea of not being as black and white a thing and everyone just having doubts the whole way and basically forgiving each other? they're ancient beings and *it is* kind of a complicated thing so i liked that they addressed that, even including Kingo being like ""hey I agree with the bad guy but i won't kill you for my beliefs lol bye"", interesting stuff that could have been explored more.",qn0q4y

hjqbh1r,"This movie should have taken place entirely in Babylon. Shown then building Babylon and defending it from the deviants, then figure out a way for one of them to learn the truth about the Celestials but still be “magically” prohibited from interfering in non-deviant events. At the end Babylon is destroyed and they go their separate ways.

We shouldn’t have had a celestial destroy the earth type of threat. This should have laid foundations for future Eternal movies. 

We could have had amazing ancient set pieces. Maybe they weren’t forbidden from interfering at first and that’s why Babylon is build. They’re building this Tower of Babel and figure out the the celestials are nefarious. In the end the celestials decide that humans can’t be allowed to develop that quickly, which is why humans are developmentally so far behind the other planets in the MCU, and destroy the tower of babel and Babylon. Stopping the celestials from destroying humanity entirely, but leaving them split up causes the eternals to be reset with new programming. No interfering.

hjepo2k,"Just saw it yesterday , here is my thoughts.

The movie is not as bad as the critic says, before the movie ends I don't understand why it's rotten. It's not perfect of course but it don't feel long and it kept me engaged. It's like an adventure. Just too much exposition and jumping around. 

The downside is Serci being the main lead and had zero emotional connection and chemistry with her co-star Ikaris. Like they even force the add a sex scene in it and the dialogue was "" I love you Serci, I love you Ikaris"". It was sooooooo bad. It really took you out of the movie. Also I never read the comics but I thought Ikaris is a leader and good guy? Don't understand why they make him a villain in this one. Deviants were almost non-existant plot tool. Angelina Jolie did well enough but not much, don't know why they keep her around, she gotta be mad expensive. Ajak was good enough. Kit Harrington didn't do anything ecept for end credit scenes with Blade. Kingo was decent comic relieve but they didn't use him at all in the end sequence like wtf. Gilgamesh was funny too died for no reason. Phastos was cool. You love and hate Sprite. Makkari is prob a fan fav and her flash like scenes are so cool. Druig was good, scene stealer.

Thought-provoking too, really makes you think did we just sacrifice 8billion more new lives. Also, Ikaris diving straight to the sun was dumb as hell and took me out of the movie again. 

Overall 7.5/10. Would watch again. Worth it just for the IMAX Cinematography alone.",qn0q4y
hjez82k,"Wasn't a fan, and I did go in with open expectations and the hope it'd be good.

So much exposition. So so so much. Didn't feel necessary to have a long journey to each and every place the rest of the Eternals were hanging out at, as well as where they've hung out throughout history. Honestly felt like I was just on a huge layover to get where I was going. You just need to get them all in one place quickly and have some brief convos that explain their motivations/wants/needs/desires, rather than 45 min of constant travels.

Something better would have been to have one of them who is still mourning a past human love of theirs, like someone who died in the 6th or 7th century, and that eternal still makes a habit of showing up to their hedgestone or something. Gives you a sense that they've been around A LONG time and gives you a deeper feeling of how they've grown attached to humans.

But even then, it's pretty weird that the main celestial would forbid them from ever involving themselves in human affairs, despite how SOME OF THEM GET MARRIED TO HUMANS AND BECOME FAMOUS BECAUSE OF HUMANS! How is that not going to cloud your judgment a bit?

Had trouble taking the Deviants seriously as a threat (obvs they were not the real threat). And when we get a more human version of one, he's just kind of wasted. Also kind of weird how they'd still have such trouble fighting them, considering they've been doing this for THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

Why couldn't the main celestial just explain to the Eternals who they were and his goal from the get go? If they're meant to serve him, didn't seem like there'd be need for a ruse, they'd know not to get to close to humans since they'd all die soon anyway. The whole ""hello Gemma Chan this is my real plan"" monologue took me out of it.

Random, but the whole ""did you know Sprite loves Ikaris?"" thing took me out of it. Like there were no hints of this earlier (or at least none I caught) or anything to suggest it'd have any bearing on the plot whatsoever, and Kingo blurts out ""YOU LOVE IKARIS! GUYS DIDN'T YOU KNOW? SHE LOVES IKARIS!"" She had the most interesting backstory, a millennia-old being who's treated by the real world as a kid, and they wasted that.

I wish they'd incorporated Kit Harrington more and actually made him somewhat central to the plot in some way, like he knows something or can do something that can help save the day, rather than just show up at the start and the end.

The movie served it's purpose though and kind of the ""here is the explanation of who the eternals/celestials are when you encounter them in other Marvel movies."" But it's one of the few I won't rewatch again.",qn0q4y

I should be able to tell it myself through her looks of longing. I did not. 

I thought there would be more of a payoff to the Deviants.

I liked the references to the DC universe. Thought that was fun. 

Cool that there was a gay kiss in the movie. I sorta felt like it was a bit of “gay face” from the actor in that film. I feel that they should have cast a gay actor, but representation is still nice to see. 

Overall, 7/10.",qn0q4y
hjdv9po,"Y’all have done a good job calling out the flaws but one I haven’t seen is that the characters keep talking about how much they love humanity but I have no reason to believe it. There are only a couple ‘humans are good’ scenes, and as many if not more scenes of humans killing each other. The movie almost feels joyless and the eternals coming together to save humanity in the end doesn’t pay off for me.",qn0q4y

hjf84f3,"Sooooo I actually liked this! Kinda surprised by the critics score, I will say on the beginning it was tough to keep track of the different beings (Celestials, Eternals, Deviants) and it felt kind of slow moving but by the end I really liked it. I really liked the team and their chemistry. Makkari and Druig were standouts for me and Angelina Jolie really does have a presence huh. Hadn’t seen her in a movie in awhile and was great to see her. 

I’m also surprised at the critics saying Gemma Chan and Richard Madden were flat bc I liked them but oh well. 

Kit Harington was fun in his small role. His yelping and running had me giggling! A difference from Jon Snow lol. Looking forward to more of him.",qn0q4y

hjqmguy,"How this movie is the worst rated MCU movie ever is beyond me. I thought it was pretty awesome. Definitely in the top half MCU movies for me. I like the characters, the action scenes, the visuals... And even the emotional stuff affected me too. 

The hate this movie is getting on Reddit is ridiculous in my humble opinion. I think it's not even the worst MCU movie of the year. 

7.5/10",qn0q4y
hk1081x,"This is by far the worst Marvel movie that I have seen worse than Captain Marvel, Hulk, etc. I went in there thinking it probably still has some cool scenes like most Marvel movies, but nope. I don't remember any characters. For people that have lived for thousands of years, they act like they are 12. Plot was disjointed and half-assed. The entire movie theater was on their phones laughing at memes only 30 min into the movies.. The Plot was an injustce ripoff. Villian's subpar, people's flat, fighting scenes a snore, and CGi for a Marvel movie it is below the bar. This is the first time a movie made me want to act like a Karen and demand a refund",qn0q4y
hjd7bq2,"My theater clapped and cheered at the nude scene, but didn't make a peep at the first gay kiss in Marvel, I giggled at both. Pacing was pretty bad at the beginning but in the end the speedster makes it a solid 7. Its nice for a Marvel movie to at least try to be different.",qn0q4y
hjel72d,"As a movie fan, it's stunningly mediocre. It's very meandering, and despite some surface differences, it hews incredibly close to the standard MCU formula. It's probably the safest film they've made in years. Some things were better than I expected, some were worse. Acting was mostly good. Thena probably would have had more to do if it wasn't Angelina. I imagine her character was scales back as a compromise for the pay cut she must have taken to be part of the ensemble. Gemma Chan and Richard Madden had zero chemistry, which made that crux of the film difficult. The special effects were great aside from Pip at the end, but almost all the terrible MCU effects moments are from post-credits scenes. Probably because they're filmed so much later.

As a comic fan, I don't think there's ever going to be a time when I don't hate this film with all my heart. The MCU is the path of least resistance and being let down by that is my own fault after 26 films. But these characters could have been so much more and added so much more to the universe, but the film just chose not to. This movie could have laid down groundwork for the fucking X-Men, but didn't. I cannot conceptualize choosing to adapt these characters if you're going to make them as bland as possible.",qn0q4y

hjg62xx,"Those critic reviews did not reflect my opinion at all once again. This film was a whole epic for me. Quintessentially marvel but elevated to another scale and grand on all accounts. Really enjoyed the pacing, the trademark comedy was hitting, the timing and impact of the slow moments was meaningful, the moral exploration of humanity was interesting and the expansion of this universe was so cool.

Aside from that, >!I did find Icarus's character a bit conflicting especially how he went out. Flying into the sun was poetic but I don't know if it was necessary for the sake of closure. The deviant boss also did feel a bit underwhelming. And a last nit pick is that the water displacement from the celestial waking up surely would create 100m high tsunamis world wide!< 😂 Overall though, really excited to see how the story continues",qn0q4y

hjkk56p,"My wife and I went to see this in theaters last night -- we had already seen Dune and wanted something different / fun as we had a sitter. I was sorely disappointed. Eternals was arguably the worst film I have ever seen. 

On the one hand, it seemed to make a joke of the whole idea of superhero films / ideas with Kit Harrington's character joking around with Sersi (Cersei?) and the weird cameraman guy with Kumail Nanjiani's character. On the other, it took itself super seriously with strange characters like Druig getting upset at all this fighting and everyone getting super emotional and developing connections with Ajak who seemed like the worst leader on the planet. And then Sprite, most annoying of all, says she's upset because she doesn't get to feel love / act normal? 

Other questions -- how does society not just collapse after massive red guy shows up on the horizon and there are worldwide quakes? Why does Phastos get upset at the Atom Bomb and not at other wars / other events? Why weren't the Eternals absolutely ripped -- supposed to be demigods right? Also why does Ajak say ""Arishem's methods are archaic"" -- this has been done for literally eternity, just now you say, hey it's 2021 this method of death and rebirth that has been the foundation of the universe is not ok anymore -- that's not at all logically consistent with what I'd think the moral underpinning of the universe would need to hold. 

At the end of the day, I thought this was really poorly done. Akin to a high school play -- indecision all around, super slow character development where I found myself actively rooting for the Deviants and/or complete destruction of the earth.

Also thought the CGI was horrible.",qn0q4y
hjmf6wd,"I don't really have an opinion on the movie because I did not internalized everything yet but here are some thoughts that I've had while watching it
1. The movie was tone deaf. The jokes where not funny and nobody in the audience laughed. We had a silly camera-guy in one shot and then we have some serious ""oh you know that character (who the audience don't know) is actually dead"" lines. And then actors all made serious overly dramatic faces. I noticed that once a Bollywood actor and the camera-guy were out of picture the movie started to feel a lot better because a forced ""humor"" disappeared. 
2. The sex scene was so unnecessary why did they even had to show it? To make some headlines? 
3. The very fist moment I saw the paragraph which briefly explains who celestials and eternals are I knew the movie has some big problems
4. CGI deviant villain is yet another example of a horribly written Marvel villain. Why they keep adding them? 
5. The very first battle in the movie and the scene where Sersi gives a boy her knife was just... not really good? Like meh? The battle was so so. The boys father was a meme and the boy just didn't even act? Just blinked and watched? I never saw any movie by Cloe Zhang but it was a very underwhelming introduction to a movie which made me wonder why this director got an Oscar.
 Overall the movie felt like 7 out of 10 which is not bad. It has its flaws but I was able to be intrigued by the story and post-credits scenes and I totally want to re-watch it again. 
In terms of screenwriting alone this movie - I'm afraid - IS the weakest movie out of MCU and for the script I would have given it only 4 out of 10",qn0q4y
hjd643w,"This one didn’t make sense to me on a lot of the story points. I think because it’s a superhero film you’re just supposed to hand wave things away. You know, these movies are for kids you dumb adult.",qn0q4y

hjdy62p,"Lol, suck shit Marvel",qn0q4y
hjdywle,"I loved the cast, how diverse they were, how nuanced both the eternals and deviants were, and by god that CGI was unreal / beautiful. Those creatures were amazing! But man...

That story did not trust the viewer to figure anything out on their own. I hated how much it dragged because they felt compelled to tell us everything instead of showing us. I swear that opening text was instantly explained AGAIN in the movie so I'm not even sure why they bothered having that opening. 

Major spoiler about a character: >!Also they made it far too clear that Ikarus was a bad guy like the first scene they showed him. My friend and I both guessed instantly that he was going to betray them and we were correct lol.!<

I'd rate it between a 3 and a 5 out of 10. That movie just was too dull / boring for a lot of it. The characters interacted with each other great in the more fun scenes but as soon as it got serious, it was so awkward. Really felt like they wasted how fun this full cast was. Out of the 5 people I saw it with, 4 (including myself) felt like the movie dropped the ball and 2 still enjoyed it, so not all bad.",qn0q4y

hjmb20q,"Alright, the reviews of this film are really confusing me, because it was legitimately good. It was definitely not perfect, you can make some fair criticism about it being overstuffed and the Deviants being a bit irrelevant, but it’s far from the worst MCU film and is certainly one of the most unique and original ones. And it probably falls under Scorsese’s definition of “cinema!”

Maybe this is just me as a Game of Thrones fan but I *loved* Richard Madden as Ikaris, he was a total badass and I hope he didn’t actually die in the end. Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo was great as well, as was his valet Karun (as an Indian the amount of India representation and scenes was nice to see, maybe they’re trying to get more of that juicy Indian market haha). But honestly all of the Eternals were good characters in their own way, it was impressive how Chloé Zhao was able to make each of the ten distinct. Overall, the critics missed the mark on this one imo.",qn0q4y

hjes6ki,"It was....weird.
I mean I can appreciate Zhao's vision IN ABSTRACT but her style doesn't fit at all with Marvel.
Also the movie isn't that much different from the classic marvel formula so it all feels convoluted and clumsy, you can shoot on natural light and I LOVE that but then you can't put on the frame some random CGI monster, so the movie doesn't know what to be and for me ended being.... nothing.

I didn't feel anything during the whole thing, the characters seems dull and shallow, there are too many characters and plot threads and not one of them feel resolved at the end.

Some individual shot here and there works and I can appreciate some ideas but then the execution is all over the place and doesn't work at all, at least for me.
Also the editing is really bad and choppy in some places.",qn0q4y
hjggnv9,"I'll be honest, I didn't like that very much. I thought it was overstuffed with characters, so every arc wasn't developed well enough, some of the flashbacks (namely the hiroshima one) were just fucking terrible, every action scene except for the last one were bad, and it was slow with lots of exposition, which isn't inherently bad - I liked dune a lot, but the writing felt obvious, badly written with some subpar acting from a lot of actually talented people. The deviant villain is the one from Thor 2 levels of awful and forgettable too. 

That being said, even if the theme of morality and purpose were not developed well enough at all, Druig was still the best character for just trying to develop that a little bit. It felt like he actually had emotions, where most everyone else was just kind of stoney faced the entire movie even though the stakes are ridiculously huge for a standalone origin story movie.

Also, I absolutely LOVED the lovecraftian-esque celestial stuff I would think much higher of this movie if it had focused on that the entire film instead of the bad and underbaked stuff it did focus on stuff.

It's such a shame because it clearly tries so hard to be a good and unique movie, and I feel like it really could have been, but it seems clear that marvel meddled with this a lot to force adherences to continuity and the bad marvel formula stuff like the jokes in, which makes the film noticeably worse considering how serious it's trying to be.

hjpqr34,"The quips/writing in this movie were so bad. At times the dialogue was so predictable I found myself whispering what the characters were about to say lol. 

Ikaris crying at the very end, and then yeeting himself into space and then directly into the sun was hilarious. My theater laughed. Nothing against Richard Madden, but his ""evil"" aspects were like a D-tier take on Homelander. 

I do agree with others in that this would have worked much better as a series, with each episode focused on a character.",qn0q4y
hjrbyf5,"It finally happened. They finally made a MCU film that's just dull. Genuinely cannot believe this is the same person that directed Nomadland and the producers that made Shang-Chi (which was just full of energy). The set piece are just Man of Steel 2.0 minus the skyscrapers. None of the 'family' members had any chemistry with each other. 

Take out the few mentions to Dr. Strange, Avengers, and Thanos and this doesn't feel like a MCU film at all. They made references to Batman and Superman which felt really out of place.",qn0q4y

Most of the deviant stuff seemed a waste of time especially the part with Thena and the alpha Deviant. There's some backstory between them but I guess I missed it or it wasn't there.

hjdfy4l,"I have mixed feelings about the movie. The potential was there for it to be top-tier comic-book movie.

- Huge scale story. The cinematography showed that well. 
- Score by Ramin Djawadi is great. 
- Too many characters were introduced but underdeveloped. Only Thena went through a proper character arc. 
- Sersi is a likable protagonist but too naive. 
- Kingo just went missing for the entire 3rd act because he believe in their mission and didn't want to help the good Eternals. None of that was set up and Kumail didn't even have a shirtless scene. 
- Barry Keoghan crushed his scenes! He was the one Eternal who acted like he went through 7,000 years of pain of not intervening.
- Makkari, Gilgamesh, Thena, Druig and Phastos were the more interesting Eternals and they had better camaderie than the other members.
- Movie jumped around a lot. Non-linear storytelling felt like a wrong choice. There were a lot scenes that could have gone longer or completely removed.
- Deviants were such forgettable villains that they were kinda annoying in the 3rd. They were wrong by the Celestials too but that was never explored much.
- Eternals fighting among themselves debating whether to interfere with human affairs or to wake up Tiamut was much more interesting but did not explore enough.
- Mid-credits scene was great! It introduces Starfox played someone unexpected and set ups a much more interesting/formidable antagonists for the Eternals 
- Kit Harington was good in his limited screentime and excited for his future in the MCU.
- Who is the voice in the post-credits speaking to Kit Harrington's character will be the source of so many theory video in YouTube!

My feelings are all over the place, just like the movie. I think I might like it more in the future!",qn0q4y

hjdoxc4,"Felt like it was a solid 8/10 Movie. I can see why people hate it, it does a lot of back story and world building instead of the typical marvel formula. I really enjoy the world building stuff so it was fine by me. 

Black knight with the cursed ebony blade was sick. Harry styles at the end was a welcome surprise. Evil Superman was pretty predictable but it was cool seeing it. Star Wars easter egg, and Marvel recognizing DC with the Superman call out. The aesthetics of the film with their suits were cool too.",qn0q4y
hjds50p,"Doesn't deserve the bad reviews, solid 8/10. I especially appreciate the lack of slow mo, even for the speedster (looking at you DC).

Visuals, stunning. Music, epic. Characters, I'd say well developed and relatable given how many there were. The group/family scenes were all pleasant to watch and had some natural feeling to them. The pacing on the flashbacks was seamless and smooth. Action, good and visceral. You can really feel the impact of every hit. But there was a lot more potential for creativity, for teamwork. You have ten eternals, where are the combinations?

Finally, the writing could have been tighter. Exposition dump by text at the beginning should have been visually shown. Exposition dump by celestial makes the reveals not as impactful. The story is building these eternals up as humans and then the Celestial is just like oh you're robots. The story is building eternals up as saviors of humans, then celestial is like oh humans are food for baby celestial. It's too convenient. It would be been better to find out via Thena's mad weary flashbacks or something. The Ikarus betrayal and reveals should have been condensed into a dramatic turn instead of spread out. It feels like different characters learn the truth at different times and weakens the emotional effect.

Ikarus motivation is not clear and his execution is weak. Why is he loyal to the Celestial and betray his family? Why is he bringing the group together if he wants the emergence to happen? The final fight sequence looked good, but did not build up or flow well. Too many 1 on 1's and interruptions. Deviant showing up at the end ruined the civil war as well for largely no point.

I'm definitely still a bit disappointed as with the talent and cast involved along with the MCU's track record, this should've been a slam dunk.

I liked most of the characters, but I think there were too many, there are lot of interesting ideas they try to tackle with each of them but none of them get developed too much. This movie is still introducing characters about halfway through the movie and then expects you to buy into their thousand year+ relationships. It's weird though, because this is already the 2nd longest MCU movie of all time, yet it still feels a little undercooked.

As far as the visuals, Chloe Zhao's direction is mainly good and there are some pretty awesome looking shots all over the movie, the scope of the Eternals ship as well the Celestials make everything else on Earth look tiny in comparison. I really like how this movie looks in some ways, but in others I don't. The Deviants design did not do it for me at all, maybe I'm just tired of massive amounts of CGI in films but they looked like they came out of a PS2 game, and I couldn't get invested in any fights that involved them.

hjnqobs,"I went into the movie thinking it would be bad because of the shockingly low RT score, and the fact that I thought Nomadland was a snore and just very uncomfortable.

I came out of this movie very surprised. It wasn’t a great movie, but I didn’t think it was bad either. Questionable decisions all around, ESPECIALLY the sheer pointless-ness of having Deviants. But all of those problems felt like small faults that are typically present in like any 6-7 rated film.

The pacing was hardly a problem. I don’t understand how that’s the biggest problem of the movie. Countless MCU films are far too long for their content, but this is probably the only movie in the MCU that desperately needed a longer runtime to adequately flesh out characters and give more weight to the central conflict.

Overall this movie is a solid 7 with lots of potential but lots of faults that keep it from being great. Much better than other Marvel movies that I would consider terrible (Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Iron Man 2, etc.)",qn0q4y

Feels a spot insulting lol. Overall pretty solid but the talking deviant didn't add anything and felt like less of a threat than the dog one, and the final scenes all fell flat. It's weird as the  amazon fight was really well done, and then the final one felt kinda eh.",qn0q4y
hjqk805,"They all appear to be quite durable but then Druig just brains Sprite with a rock and that knocks her out cold?

We needed a scene of Robb Stark learning the truth and then bailing out, rather than them just talk about it.  And then cut a lot of other scenes. Some of the humor worked but a lot of it just didn’t and I think it was because some of the characters were so wooden and badly written.

Deviants were only in this as a red herring.  Took a lot of pop out of the focus of the film as their threat was inconsequential.

Just…… boring.  Number 1 problem with this movie is that 12 year olds (I don’t think) will like this.  Too boring.",qn0q4y
hjrdo8o,"After watching Eternals a second time, I gotta say I appreciate both of Sersi’s romances a lot more. The one with Ikaris feels weaker because Madden plays the character a bit too stoic, which is understandable given his character’s eventual reveal. Even then, I really liked all their tender moments by the rocks and the flashbacks.

Sersi and Dane was much better. Their chemistry during the birthday party alone was pretty crackling.",qn0q4y

One thing that stood out to me was that I expected Druig to be the big bad of the movie because of his anger but he wasn’t. I’m glad with that decision because instead they made a character that is genuinely morally gray. He was a really well written character

hknltl8,"Hi I wanted to air my thoughts, as I was massively disappointed with eternals, and maybe I'm missing something? 
I went in without knowing what to expect, had not read any comics or had no knowledge of the eternals, but have really enjoyed the MCU and not seen a poor film so didn't think it could go wrong. 
How did this film get greenlit? How did the producers think this was the best story for immortal beings? 
And how can the enemy be something as small as a chituri from avengers assemble , and a little in fighting to show this ""family"" were like your everyday household?  And it was waaaay too long.
The whole excuse of not being involved in human conflict as war leads to advancement which leads to more humans was a bit of a stretch, and even so, surely when aliens start attacking and thanos appears they could have offered some assistance - considering his plan was to wipe out half the galaxy it seems that it goes against the eternals end goal anyway so they should have been straight in there helping with endgame? 
The film should have been set before 90's I think as only way they could fit in , then they leave to find other eternals before iron man, Captain America etc have their battles and films. 
Oh god just thinking of everything that was wrong with it is annoying me, I watched the film on Saturday, today I watched Shang chi as hadnt seen that yet either and Shang chi had more going for it within the first 10 minutes then the whole 2.5 hours of bore that is eternals. These immortal beings have been here for thousands of years and seen a lot but still act like childish twerps that have no clue what they are up against or how to work in a team, they would surely have kept an eye on the avengers and seen how to work together and what happens if they dont (civil war)
Gemma chan was great in Humans, but she was a bit soft and seemed lost in her character - just a wide eyed toddler, Kit Harrington sounded like an idiot, (not sure what they do to British accidents in Hollywood films). Angelina Jolie was just an extra , it was an ensemble movie without the individual character films to lead to this point. 
And why bother evolving the enemy just for it to be killed off?",qn0q4y
hksopao,"Angelina Jolie was just making ""I miss Brad Pitt"" faces the whole time",qn0q4y
hl2jry4,"Just saw the movie and loved it. But I did have some minor gripes: 

Cersei didn’t really feel like a lead character or like a true leader of the group. A lot of times she was just standing around in scenes.

The sex scene was definitely a little oddly placed. It’s definitely something I wasn’t expecting in a Marvel movie to portray that level of intimacy between two people. I just couldn’t help but feel it was unnecessary considering we got a solid montage of their relationship building up into their marriage. 

The deviants had major “side quest” energy. And the main one showing up to the island for the final fight just felt like they wanted to close out that side story in the middle of the main one. 

I thought the focus on the characters themselves was fantastic. I really cared about all of them throughout the movie and the one death hit me hard. There were a lot of philosophical elements to the movie. Druig’s little community was so unsettling well done. Despite his efforts to keep humans safe he had stripped them of free will. 

The kid who played Sprite did an awesome job acting wise. Angelina Jolie was bringing the A game as well. The whole scene where they debated wiping her memory and she didn’t want to lose her memories or who she is was brutal.

 I appreciated that the humor in the movie was well written subtle jokes instead of the traditional Marvel one liners and sometimes forced humor that derails the seriousness of Marvel movies sometimes. 

This is one I definitely got to watch again because there is so much in it. It’s an ambitious movie but I am glad Marvel legit did something so drastically different in tone.",qn0q4y

hll5xq6,"its sooo good if I didnt overthinking some of the plot. but some of my gripes are:

\- Ikaris should've been dead by being beaten by the rest. its such a chicken move by marvel to not do this and just made him poetically suicide to the sun.

\- I really really really fucking hate Kit Harrington character. if you wanna have black knight then have it, dont just do mini tease mini tease mini tease that only comic book nerd knows about. its too random, too unnecessary, too much screen time.

\- some un-explained stuff. Ikaris being the strongest is never mentioned until they have to fight him. Phastos suddenly shout at Ikaris ""I always wanna clip your wings"".

\- Sprite could've got a very nice arc with her character, but her contribution in final battle was: a measly knife stab, make a villain motivation speech, got her head smashed with rock.

\- Why Ajak care for human? what makes her pity Earth after millions of years doing the same thing.

\- weird power level. Serci almost died because of stab by a dagger, but druig survive being lazered until hundered meters into the earth.",qn0q4y

hskpdpg,Wow marvel loves killing anything that isn't in the form of a human. They really shouldn't have killed the deviant it had a great arc and could have been the martian manhunter of this world.

hjo959c,"Ok, I don't really get the negative critical reviews.  I really dug this.  It seemed like they really avoided a lot of the common criticisms of other MCU movies, (I didn't notice any quipy jokes at otherwise serious moments, seemed like there were actually stakes/no one felt safe there was a point when I thought they might go full rogue one and kill everyone, while there was plenty of CGI in the climax it was a lot cleaner/easier to follow than say, Shang Chi or Black Panther).

I dunno, I went in expecting to be disappointed and I think it might have actually been my favorite post Endgame movie.",qn0q4y

I went to film school, I literally became a filmmaker because of Avengers. I thought it'd be impossible for me to like an MCU movie more than that, because how can you beat that?

I liked Eternals more than Avengers. I understand some of the critique, but for me? I loved this one so much.",qn0q4y

hjuejut,"The Eternals isn’t just a bad movie in the same way **Venom: Let there be Carnage** or **Suicide Squad** are bad movies. While both these movies are bad in their own way, they’re still movies made with a certain level of competence, coherence and consistency.

Eternals isn’t just bad for the usual trivial reasons that one would usually consider a super-hero flick, or something akin to it, terrible.  Typical flaws of those movies being in the realm of bad and/or forgettable villains, bad CGI, jokes that don’t quite land, main characters that are uninteresting, etc.

Were it only for such flaws, this would put Eternals more in line with your Average bland and mediocre super-hero movie such as Green Lantern & Thor: The Dark World.

While Eternals certainly has all those previously mentioned faults in ample quantity, it simply fails at a much deeper more fundamental level to begin with.  It is a shocking display of complete ineptitude and incompetence on a 200 million dollar budget and displayed on 4 simultaneous screens in most theatres across the globe.  Marvel should be embarrassed that this was ever allowed to leave their studio and were I the head of Disney at the moment heads would be rolling.

Die-hard Marvel fans are currently drinking the cool-aid and on a steady supply of Copium; taking the stance that the movie isn’t bad, but an ambitious and bold breaking of formula. Arguing that the reason for this ‘mixed’ reception is due to the movie having unexpected ‘artsy’ qualities that are throwing people off.

And while I wouldn’t consider myself a great connoisseur of indie and artsy movies, I do watch them and enjoy these kinds of movies very much. Just this year, The Green Knight received a lot of flack as it was considered too artsy and slow paced for your average movie-goer, yet I really liked that movie.  So please, Marvel fans, spare me the bullshit: “ Well, this movie perhaps was too artsy for you”.

It’s not artsy. It’s a shit movie that fails by every metric. A movie of fractured narratives, weird & inconsistent tone, incomplete and stupid character motivations, etc etc.

For a movie whose fans claim is attempting to break formula and is a thinking-man’s version of its predecessor , it blunders and humiliates itself whenever it tries to tackle anything serious or sensitive, it has some childishly corny moments that one would expect in a parody of a children’s cartoon and has so many holes in its story that it’s impossible to take it seriously.

Like, a few people in this thread have already pointed a lot of the problems here, but just take The Celestial for example. I thought that he initially looked appropriately ethereal, otherworldly and awesome (in the literal sense of that word, not it’s colloquial use), but he progressively lost all credibility with me as the story kept showing his incompetence with all his creations turning against him.

Let me preface this next criticism by saying that I’m not one of those cringe anti-SJW. For example, I thought that one scene with all the girls in Avengers: End Game was fine, I understood why it was there and it didn’t really bother me, but...

The Celestial having a mute Eternal was so uncanny and laughable to me. It would be like a Holocaust movie where the Nazis are insisting on the respect of proper gender pronouns within the Death Camps. It reminded me of an episode in the Harley Quinn animated TV series where one of the villains gets cancelled for calling Wonder Woman a ‘Cunt’. In that episode Lex Luthor, holding a press conference as the representative of the Legion of Doom, publicly expels him from the organization, stating “We cannot condone Dr. Psycho use of the C word, as it does not represent our brand of evil”.

Furthermore, how is she using ASL and how are they using English before English and ASL were ever a thing. The Angles and the Saxons haven't invaded Britain, the Norman invasion hasn't brought the French needed to transform Old Anglo-Saxon English into the language we know it as today. Not even mentioning ASL.

Keep in mind that if you believe this to be a more serious and artsy movie, you can’t turn around and brush-off these kinds of criticism with “It’s a super-hero flick, just turn off your brain-off bro”. You can’t have your cake and eat it too.

This movie fails on every level. It fails at being a fun and simple blockbuster movie and doesn't even come close to being an actual serious artsy movie.",qn0q4y
hjh7o5k,"I absolutely loved this movie.  I cannot wait for the next one.

This is probably the Marvel movie I've been most excited for since Endgame because of the mixed critical reception.  It's nice to see Marvel take a bigger risk than before.  I hope they don't lose faith in Zhao for a sequel.

It's so enjoyable to see this kind of comic book cosmic nonsense brought to the MCU.

I did pick that Ikaris was going to be the bad guy and had killed Ajax and set them up.  I loved his end, flying into the Sun is such an insane comic book ending.

I thought it was really refreshingly slow for an MCU film.  It wasn't rushing through things, I'm sure you could cut a lot of the flashback stuff out but I feel it added to the characters and the film.

Not to randomly kick another film, but my biggest problem with something like The Suicide Squad is that while it looks amazing, there's no emotion to it because everyone is completely expendable and none of the characters were fleshed out enough for me to care about them.  This film avoided all that by having less characters, really building them up, and also having them actually be unique in terms of power level.  In an Eternals sequel, they might find more Eternals but not more on the team, as it were.  In TSS it felt like you just do another lap of that prison and you can completely refill the ranks.

It's not quite Doctor Strange in terms of visuals, but it's not trying to be.  It all looks amazing and it's great how the techology in the movie is so far beyond ours that there's no irritating exposition on how they're going to get things to work or whatever.

I really believed the characters.  I enjoy how they felt very real, none of them were caricatures or one-dimensional or whatever.  I appreciated that Kingo (Kumail) left and didn't reappear at a really convenient moment in the final battle.  I'm surprised that I believed Ikaris's turn at the end.  That moment would be very easy to get wrong and they didn't, which is good.

I'm surprised at how little Black Knight there was in this film, but I enjoyed that.  No idea how the fuck Blade ties into his story going forward, but I'm excited.

I don't think I could have enjoyed this more.  From the mixed reviews the only thing I was really expecting was something less Marvel formula-y (which I do still enjoy), but I'm pretty shocked that this is the best Marvel thing this year for me.  By quite a lot as well, even though I loved Loki and FatWS and a lot of Black Widow (and still mostly enjoyed Shang-Chi and What If?).

Does anyone know why Zhao is credited twice in the writing part?  Is it just part of it she wrote by herself and part of it she wrote collaboratively?  How does that work contractually?",qn0q4y
hjdaheb,"People complaining about the jumping timelines makes no sense to me. It’s called E-T-E-R-N-A-L-S. I thought each one of the Eternals were excellent characters with Gilgasmesh and Druig being my stand outs.

Ikaris made a fantastic “villain” and it was tragic to see him apologize at the end. I want to believe the sun didn’t kill him lol. Let me have that and we can get more Madden in the MCU.

Incredible movie. I really am baffled by the critical reception of this. If any MCU movie deserved to be dunked on in this current phase it was Black Widow. That was a safe money move. At least this behemoth of a movie swung for the fences.

hjhiw8d,"went in thinking it was going to be hard to pull off and with some negative critics feedback.

Loved it.

Its a great movie to set up the whole celestial thing in the MCU, it really ups the scale, and I cant believe they pulled off a celestial appearing in the sky in a way that looked absolutely awesome.

Loved the characters, esp Phastos (yey, gay and black and not dead, its a first, and also not cliched, just a normal bloke who happens to be gay, well done).

Only downside was I spent a lot of the movie expecting a deviant - eternal team up, thought it was going that way. Oh well. 

I understand why some wont like it, its not a by the numbers marvel movie, but quite frankly those were getting stale and formulaic, glad they branched out, and changed the pace. I like full on action all the time movies, but not for every movie. The source material offers so much more than that, its nice they captured some of it in this film.

Solid film, great setup for more.",qn0q4y
hjeba5q,"Personally, I loved the movie. From the action, to the visuals, to the pacing, I think it is one of the better movies in the MCU. The only thing I can fault it on is that sometimes the exposition can gets dense almost to the point of being overwhelming, most notably when Arishem is explaining the real plans to Sersi.

I will also add that while I understand the criticism that the plot can seem messy, I don't agree with it. In my opinion, if you view Eternals as the story of Sersi and her relationship with the other Eternals, that diminishes the aforementioned mess significantly, and streamlines the plot.",qn0q4y

 Makkari, Thena, Ikaris and Sersi are the highlights  (Kingo's Alfred too lol)  The celestials look incredible. Gorgeous to see at theate. Critics hate it first but the audience  love it. It will become a classic in a few years. Cheers to Chloe and the MCU to do another thing than formula",qn0q4y

hjdinym,"This movie isn't the worst MCU movie by far, I don't know what everyone is on who say it is the worst. It's a 7/10 movie, it's fine.
Eternals is a setup film, it introduces the next phase. We meet the celestials, learn some mythos of the MCU, meet our cosmic guides in the eternals, get a little taste of the black knight, learn that the next big challenge for Earth's heros is Judgment by the celestials, hear the watcher which could elude to the gathering of champions for Judgment and still get the story of the Eternals. This couldn't have been a show because the shows aren't as important to the over arching story when compared to the main films. A show would have just put a bulk of the beginning of this phase behind the Disney + wall which is too alienating for just the movie watchers.
For where Marvel wants to take us, I think Zhao did as good as a job with what was given to her as you could possibly do and it was good.
Also I feel like love is translated from all the characters in this which I don't think I've seen other people mention.",qn0q4y
hjdat8u,"It's not great and I imagine a lot of Marvel fans will be disappointed, but I mostly enjoyed this.  Most of all, I was surprised and delighted with how existentially complex it was, something I also really enjoyed about Loki.  There's only so many times we can see ""we have to all work together to stop [villain]"" without it becoming repetitive and predictable, and I was really pleased to see this one not only having the team fundamentally disagreeing about what to do, but the decision they have to make being a tricky one where even as an audience member you can see both sides.

Also, weirdly, I think this is one of the sillier Marvel movies, despite also being one of the most serious.  It has a lot of jokes, but unlike witty quips and sarcasm that we're used to with Marvel, it was a lot of honestly just very silly humor.  Which I enjoyed!

Overall not one of Marvel's best but a really interesting path for the franchise that I'm excited to see more of.  So many great actors, and very cool to see Chloe Zhao's work scaled up to this size.

Oh, two minor things that annoyed me:  1.  Can we please start doing dates with BCE/CE?  2.

Especially if all these movies are going to culminate into some end-of-phase climax film. Is this supposed to be pretty soon after Endgame? Obviously Sam hasn’t become Cap yet. 


Or do they purposely leave it vague in case they change their minds and decide not to include certain characters or teams in future films?

hjk348c,"Yeah I just watched it and I do agree with this film being a weaker Marvel film but I feel it's a necessary film that needs to exist to continue the MCU. Zhao had an immense task to juggle a lot here, the plot, the multiple characters, their backgrounds, purpose, and relationships. 

This movie would've been better a Disney Plus exclusive with episodes focusing more on each character. Similar to Dune.

I don't think she gets quite right and honestly, I really don't see much of her directorial style in this film. It's your standard Marvel film but without the interrupting humor at a serious scene trope.

I'm more excited about what happens next in with Arishem's judgement and the faith of the Earth and Tiamut than this movie really.

Also does any else compare this film to Evangelion?

* Humanity as one or as an individual through Druig's beliefs which is basically the Human Instrumentality Project.

* Giant beings like the Celestials and the Evas/Angels

Feels like men writing women characters and not knowing what to do with them.",qn0q4y
hjs0rqh,"So after all the things that have been said about this movie it's... fine/good. I'm just confused that after all the MCU movies, this is the one that's breaks the camel's back, so to speak. I think the second half was much better than the first. The first half felt like watching a series premiere and finale cut together. It feels like we're getting set-ups and payoffs back to back with one another. The flashbacks felt repetitive and not that surprising because we know where all the characters end up. Characters are present in the flashbacks but gone from the present timeline for a loooong time (Brian Tyree Henry is absent from the movie for well over an hour). The characters were cold and unrevealing, but when we don't know anything about them, then it's tough to get a read of empathize with them too much. These characters clearly have a history, but the fact that we're supposed to buy into something they're unwilling to talk about really is difficult as a viewer. It also doesn't help that our main characters are either hiding or unknowing of a lot of what's going on, and the way it's executed just makes the watch difficult. For example, Richard Madden is playing relatively stiff for most of the first half. We find out why later, but hearing everyone talk about what a leader he is and how Sersei loves him so much, we're not buying it because we're not seeing it really.

Then from about the forest section with Druig on, the movie kicks into gear. The reveals help immensely and actually give us the true arcs and emotions behind these characters. The characters actually get to emote and the story succeeds in going unexpected ways. Ultimately that saved a lot for me. Angelina Jolie and Brian Tyree Henry were the clear standouts and I liked the MCU actually  committed to something different rather than talking about it and balking at breaking their structure too much.  I know a lot has been said about Chloe Zhao and how some feel disappointed it's a Marvel film at the end and not a Zhao film. But there are specific sections and shots where you really feel her presence. The woods scene feels the most like her with the long shots and natural environment use. Overall, I'd say about a 7/10.",qn0q4y

Why is it the dullest Marvel film.

Why, after 7000 years as a ""Team"", do they have no coherent fighting strategy.  

After being alive for 7000 years, and the gravitas that would bring, do they talk and act like Millennials or Gen Zs.

The inevitable ""suprise"" evil protagonist, a British actor. (See Wonder Woman, Black Widow, and myriad of other Hollywood films with no imagination)

The film Insults the viewers intelligence and is tone deaf to the fans, in favour of the Hollywood/Political Zeitgeist. Dreary and blatant.

A great director, who can walk away from a project she never should have been in the frame for and use the money and prestige to make some more truly great films.",qn0q4y
hjdd7m3,"Really surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. My friend runs a Marvel podcast running through the history of Marvel characters so about a year or so ago he did an episode on Eternals and asked me to guest on it. In preparation for it, we read everything of the Eternals comics available on Marvel Unlimited. I ended up really disliking the majority of what I read. That combined with the reviews and early reactions I had seen for this, I didn't expect to enjoy this at all.

I ended up liking it a lot, even loving a good portion of it. It has its issues (chief among them for me being some pretty awful performances) but it felt like a fresh Marvel film to me. It did not feel formulaic at all. I have no idea where these reviewers are getting that from. I liked Shang-Chi, but this felt way, way fresher and like a good break from the MCU formula than that one did, which Shang-Chi felt like pretty standard fare Marvel to me. This one actually felt like something new, like I wasn't watching your average Marvel film that they churn out. So yeah, really happy with how much I actually liked this one, and hoping to see it do much better box office wise than it has been review wise.",qn0q4y
hjer88u,"i’m not sure why reviews are bad, it’s typical marvel fare which is to say, quite decent. cinematography and visuals are amongst marvel’s best. story wise it’s got some cool sci-fi ideas that aren’t terribly original but cool enough.

action sequences are great, specifically Makkari. humor actually felt better than in most marvel movies imo and rarely if ever interrupted emotional moments.

i never felt bored because the movie was gorgeous to look at and immerse yourself in, but it did feel like there was a lot of talking and exposition.

maybe it should’ve been a show because the fault with the movie is i didn’t have enough time to get to care about these characters since there are so many, but i know i would’ve totally fallen in love with them in a different setting or if i spent a longer time with them.

the dialogue was serviceable. kinda contrived but not bad, just too much typical “choose your own path” superhero stuff etc.

but the one and only reason this movie is being critically trashed is practically certainly due to the expectations. everyone thought it would be more artsy and emotional due to the marketing and director, when in fact it’s just more fun good marvel that sneaks in little bits of new ideas.

you’re gonna have a great time just like in any other marvel movie.",qn0q4y
hjd8t1v,"I really don’t understand the bad reviews for this movie. I really loved it. The cinematography was so damn good, the cast played really well off one another, and it was wild and existential as hell!",qn0q4y
hjeg0f6,"I really enjoyed this movie. 

I don’t understand the critic score for this movie. There is no way this movie is worse than other MCU movies like Thor The Dark World, The Incredible Hulk, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, Iron Man 2, Ant Man and Ant Man And The Wasp.

Sure, this movie had a lot of flaws. But this movie’s positives outweighs it’s negatives. I feel like critics nowadays only want comic book movies to be colorful and have jokes in them every minute.",qn0q4y
hjebm45,"I really do not understand the rating and the hate this movie is getting. I know that Rotten Tomatoes aren't a score, but a yay or nay. I'm in NSW Australia, so the cinemas only recently reopened, and I had a three-way tie between seeing this, Shangi Chi or the Last Duel. The Last Duel I obviously knew was the best movie, but I'm seeing that with someone else. Then I ended up seeing this over Shangi Chi, because that got fine reviews, while this got savaged, and was thus intrigued to see what happened. I thought from the way some people were talking about it, that it was just a Movie version of the Inhumans, and the MCU finally fell apart. 

But when I compare this film to similar scores, both Tomatoes and scores, I put this over the rest. This has a worse score than the Wonder Woman Films, which were both incredibly messy, really poor lead acting and switched from goofy to a farce. This has a worse RT score than the Snyder Justice League, which was the same nothing villain and dour heroes mixed with jarring comedy as the Whedon film, just longer and with less specific Whedonisms. This has a worse rating than Thor 2, which isn't terrible but is mainly worth seeing just for Loki and Thor. Jane was so boring in that, the dark elf Malekith was a void and the rest of it was painting by numbers. And Man of Steel was an absolute drag, both insufferable, boring, and actively aggravating, and took me multiple sittings on Netflix to finish. Amazing Spiderman 2 has a similar score and that was awful. X-Men the Last Stand has a better score. 

Some of the criticisms are also either people actively not listening or bad faith. The engineer Eternal, Phastos (no idea how to spell that before I looked it up) didn't make the nuclear bombs. He was just in despair about technology that had allowed humanity to be so destructive, which he had aided them in the shadows with. 

Also, Sprite using an illusion to flirt with a guy was barely there and hardly racey. It was broken off at a handhold. She has puppy love for Ikaris, but it never went anything deeper in the film. 

Anyway Thoughts

-All the Eternals were surprisingly distinctive given some of the chatter I heard. There is no confusing any one of them for another. Its Diversity done really well, it never felt preachy or ham-handed that one of them is deaf, one is having memory dementia, gay or stuck as a child, and each was worked in well. The issue I think that people actually have aside from being quite a few of them, is the names. I think it would have been better to stick to strictly Mythical names like Gilgamesh, instead of having that, and also having odd different spelling of myths like Thena instead of Athena. The powers were handled fine, some of them were fairly straight forward but they all stuck to the same theme design, and they felt like a team. None of them felt completely useless, and they were all integrated into the story decently.  

-Lots of great-looking set pieces. Very colorful, and distinctive. I thought it was just going to be dusty caveman at first, like the intro, but they really go all over the place. 

-The CGI was fine. It's solid, and I liked that it all fit within a single design theme. This wasn't like Black Panther, which had the end fight look really out of place, and vastly inferior to the Civil War Suit. 

-I think this was a pretty good way to use the Deviants. I'm not super familiar with the comic version, aside from knowing its basically good, beautiful Eternals fight horrible monsters. Sure these ones are just CGI beasts, all but one of them doesn't even talk, and even he is ???. But they work well with the fake-out actual villain. Could have had a bit more fleshing out, but the movie was already getting a tad long. They at least weren't the same CGI beast, there was some variety. 

-The End of Earth isn't new as a comic book movie third act climax, but I really like the way they used the scale, instead of just a small sky beam in a city. I mean there was a sky beam, but it was the heroes fending it off. The Scale of stuff was really good. 

-I really liked Kumail Nanjiani's Kingo, so it kinda sucked that he just sat out the final battle. I understand why they wanted this debate about the Celestials, to divide the Eternals more than just Ikaris. He was really good in the stuff he was in, and his assistant was solid. The Bollywood scene was fun. He really looks great, and I hope these bad reviews don't prevent a sequel. 

-Makkari (the deaf speedster) didn't get enough and was introduced a bit too late in the movie. They really should have wrapped up getting everything together a bit faster, particularly since she was just hanging out.

-Not too fussed about Salma Hayek's Ajak dying, she wasn't that great. Not bad, just fine. But I really like Gilgamesh, and the whole relationship with Thena, and the whole caring for her as she suffers living robot construct dementia. Was not expecting Ikaris to suicide into the sun, even after being the villain. Of course, being the Superman expy, sun dipping doesn't have to be the end. And these guys were cloned a bunch, so alt versions could always come back. 

-Gemma Chan was fine as the sorta ensemble protagonist. Her power could have honestly used a bit more play in doing stuff, since it lends itself to doing more. 

-The Black Knight/Jon Snow was barely in it and was kinda just lead-in for the next stuff. I Thought there was going to be more rivalry with Ikaris, but while he mentions it, he isn't like the bitter ex. Don't know how it will go for future stuff, the actor is sometimes a bit uneven.

-On the whole, the acting was solid. Barring the names, the dialogue was fine. There is a fair bit of exposition, but that's what the movie requires, it doesn't feel over the top. 

So overall, it's solid to good. If you hate Marvel movies already you aren't probably going to like it, because it's got the Marvel flavoring. But if you liked prior MCU films, then this one is a solid entry. I thought this was easily better than Black Widow, which was very much entirely fine, in almost every sense. I look forward to a sequel.",qn0q4y

hjswvfs,"Eternals having a lower RT score than wonder woman 1984 does not sit well with me at all.
I also dont understsnd why people bring dune vs eternals discussion  in social media . Dune is a part one still and it has more time to flesh out characters while eternals does not. I think if eternals was a triology or had two parts it would have been presented way better.

Eitherway i enjoyed the movie. ikaris was such a great character. I did feel his struggle with not going against the celestials and how hard it was going against the other eternals. mikkari was fantastic  she stole the show for me.

kingo leaving was an interesting choice. people taking an issue with that are focusing too hard on how needs to be a hero for earth or a cold hearted robot when he doesnt have to be. I think he has his priorties straight which are the eternals and i think he believed ikaris would win so they will be reuinted again on another planet. I wish we would have seen more of thena and her struggles i think they had a great character specially with the rest not believing her and ajak knowing all along but hiding it.  


Things i didnt enjoy:

I think salma as ajak was fine but maybe another actor could have done more with the role.

the whole plot about the celestials lying to the eternals was ok but i it didnt have a huge impact on me.

 I didnt enjoy phastos i wish the character was done differntly and i wish we saw more of his interaction with his family and humans.

The deviants should have had a better spotlight at the end.


I think it was a hard movie to nail since it deals with lots from universe creation to two new species (deviants and eternals) lots of characters and a huge timeline. There was so many things to juggle which makes me understand why its having a mixed reception but for it to be rotten is crazy.",qn0q4y

Aside from the heavy (but necessary) exposition, I can see people thinking this movie is pointless as it is extremely self-contained. It doesn’t propel other MCU films like recent previous installments have been, so this movie might just bore some.

Kingo and his valet were the highlight. I haven't seen much of Kit Harrington except for GOT but he was charming and funny here. The movie definitely has a lot of flaws that everyone here has mentioned but in no way it's a terrible film.

Stan Lee said, ""Marvel has always been and will always will be, a reflection of the world right outside our window"". I would been much happier if this was a movie with a better story first and then try to, if possible, be diverse and inclusive. For most part of the movie, Makaari is not even shown till the very end. The time jumps were not helpful and of all the talk of shooting something in natural light was horsepoop.

If only Chloe Zhao would have watched the Marvel Director's Roundtable where there is the complete *horde* of previous directors, Favreau, Whedon, Coogler, Gunn, Watiti, Reed and Ruso brothers.... always always always ***Character First***.

hjl349a,"I mostly really enjoyed this. It made a lot of bold, interesting choices for the MCU, but it really suffered every time it had to remind you it was a Marvel film

The characterisation was really well done and Zhao did a good job balancing so many primaries in one film. I really liked that Kingo fully stuck to his principles and didn't get involved in the finale, but I wish that decision was paid off in the denouement. I liked seeing Sprite so conflicted in the emergence, though I felt like there could have been a bit more foreshadowing for her desire to be human. Jolie's portrayal of Thena's mental illness felt appropriately nuanced, and Ikaris felt like a proper antagonist without falling into the easy immortal tropes, though that suicide at the end was admittedly a strange choice.

My only real complaints are: a) the Marvel of it all, constantly having to remind the audience that it's in the Marvel universe both through dialogue and artistic choices, and b) the Deviants. The Deviants made sense as a secondary antagonist of the film and a rug pull for the reveal that Arishem and Ikaris are the true antagonists, but Kro felt like he didn't serve any purpose at all other than to add action sequences and give Thena a cathartic climax.",qn0q4y

Excited and I hope they acknowledge it.

Man the after credits scenes in Shang Chi and this have me so excited for the future. To me it seem Marvel's next move is to go all out and I like it.

It is such a refreshing marvel movie to watch, took a much better balance between humor and seriousness.

I also love the fact that it didn't play the family card too much.
They were individuals who were together for a cause and went on with their lives afterwards, and banding together doesn't mean they grow to like each other.

The cinematography is fantastic. I loved Thor 3 where some shots were slow motioned and framed just right to look like a painting. 
But here everything just looks fantastic and so much subtle beauty in the shots.

It still has a few flaws, one in particular is the movie didn't feel very fluid to watch, some flashbacks to the past felt more like it wasn't designed to be a flashback shot.

Some characters could have needed more time to develop but overall I think we know just enough to keep the focus.

Apparently, all that Asian male heroes get romantically from Marvel is intense handholding (and if they are lucky, a forehead tap) with platonic besties - which is the exact same thing Shang Chi got in his own movie. And that’s more than Kumail got, despite being apparently a movie star. 

It’s really hard not to notice, with all the other characters (except for the dead one and the kid) hooking up with each other or getting minutes dedicated to their relationship arcs.",qn0q4y

hjfynub,"I really don't know if this movie is bad or ok.

I do like that there was a lot less ""Marvel humor"" in this and the trailer shot of Ikaris breaking the table is actually set up well!

It doesn't really feel as much like a Marvel movie to me, or it least not current Marvel, which is a good thing to me, but that doesn't automatically make this movie good.

It feels it's length but doesn't really drag. Usually when people say a movie feels its length they are saying it dragged, but I think it just feels ""ok"" for its length. I wasn't thinking ""OMG it's already over?"" but I also wasn't thinking ""OMG when is this ending?""

The acting, or rather lack of acting, was fine. I don't think any of the actors did poorly. The problem is there was almost nothing for them to do. When Thena and Ikaris get their real emotional scenes I actually said to myself ""Acting!"" because the rest of the movie is just people going through the motions reading crappy dialogue and being told ""Try not to sound like this is memorized.""

I literally didn't give a shit about any of these characters except Sprite and that's because I have a soft spot for the ""child is actually an adult but can't live as an adult/child grew up too fast due to life experiences so doesn't fit with kids or adults"" type character. When Gilgamesh died I was like ""Oh, he's dead already,"" not ""Oh no Gilgamesh I am so sad!""

Probably the most stupid scene, and there were several stupid scenes, to me, was when Sersei is like ""Oh hey Sprite, I still have some Celestial power, I just know I can make you human."" What?! That was completely out of nowhere and made no sense at all. I understand making her human in the movie to make it possible to bring back the actor as the same character, but from storytelling and just watching the movie that was duuuuuuumb.

Scenes were all over the place. Flashbacks often seemed out of place and out of order. We should have seen Ajak's death way, way earlier. We should have gotten that scene from the point where she lands on the ice and just not gotten to know yet that Ikaris caused it and then later had the scene of their confrontation and just have a shot of Ikaris looking down as we know Ajak is losing to the deviants. We watch the stupid super deviant powering up and powering up the other deviants, but we already know the Eternals have killed all but the one dude. Totally pointless at that point in the movie.

Speaking of pointless, why are the Celestials making Eternals that aren't Ikaris at all? Ok, I can give you Ajak for healing after a bad deviant fight and Phastos for helping intelligent life with technology, but every other Eternal is completely pointless. And why make Sprite a kid? That makes no sense at all. Why make a deaf Eternal? Again, no sense at all.

Sersei - pointless, Ikaris should just be able to rip a deviant's head off.

Makkari - pointless, Ikaris flew from earth to the sun in like 10 seconds lol get rekt speedster

Sprite - pointless, Ikaris should just be able to rip a deviant's head off.

Gilgamesh - pointless, Ikaris should just be able to rip a deviant's head off.

Kingo - pointless, Ikaris should just be able to rip a deviant's head off.

Thena - pointless, Ikaris should just be able to rip a deviant's head off.

Druig - super pointless, Ikaris should just be able to rip a deviant's head off and the Eternals aren't supposed to interfere with humans (although for some reason Phastos is allowed to give tech)

So just make a shit load of Ikari, some Ajaks, and some Phastoses. Like wtf Celestials? Are you just dumb?


And what was with all the random uses of different language? It was annoying. I'm not talking when it made sense like when they are in different parts of the world and the people speak a language that's not English, I am talking about stuff like Phastos's husband having to speak for his mom or Kingo's buddy suddenly speaking Hindi (I assume). It was just annoying and felt forced and was the only time when I thought ""Oh yeah, that want to be able to say how amazingly diverse this movie is so this is forced.""

I can give Eternals looking different for the sake of the audience being able to tell them apart, but why the hell do they all have different accents and all talk like they're from 2021 even when they first arrive? I understand the actors literally having those accents, but from the perspective of watching the movie, it's fucking stupid.",qn0q4y

My biggest worry going into it was how they’d establish the backstory, current story, characters, and how they’d give us a reason to care about these characters  in a 2 hour and 30 minute runtime, and it failed to meet the mark.

hjjswxv,"
here’s the thing with eternals. yes, we got a loving interracial gay family that has a super hero in it and it was wonderful. yes, we got a d/Deaf woman of color as a superhero and she used sign language in the film and it was wonderful. yes, we got some really awesome men and women of color as leads and it was wonderful. however. 

the main issues with eternals i had were the underuse/killing off of the men of color to focus on the white male lead and the 3 of 4 women in the film had their character development centered around this white male lead. don’t lie to yourselves and say “i didn’t notice that!!” because it was so blatantly obvious. 

they killed off gilgamesh about 30 minutes after his introduction and for what? shock value? gilgamesh was awesome from the moment they introduced him, and it’s a damn shame they didn’t let him live. he was interesting, his story with thena should’ve been explored more, and he added soul to a film that was lacking it. on the flip side, right after the death of gilgamesh we are introduced to phastos, our gay black dad. phastos was absolutely kick-ass don’t get me wrong but he felt underutilized. in the final battle he didn’t even fight physically, he just…was there. we also got the bonus of kingo (the absolute bright spot of the film) peacing out and not even being involved in the final fight for no reason?? he should’ve been there. he should’ve fought too. 

the women of the film were treated so badly i left the theater enraged. ajax had been dead the entire time, sersi’s story revolved around two white men, sprite was literally the “5000 year old l*li” trope from anime, and makkari spent most of the film in hiding and we didn’t really get a proper introduction to her until the final act. makkari had maybe a total of 30 minutes of screen time because she spent most of her time in hiding. there was a really cool story there they could’ve done about the d/Deaf community but they didn’t go for it and that was incredibly disappointing. 

and this was all because the film focused on my most hated marvel character ever, the kylo ren of marvel, ikaris. 

ikaris had the personality of cardboard and the acting skills of it. there was no depth to ikaris beyond “sersi pretty but i am teh evils”. for some reason, the film decided he should be a heavy focus and for what? to make racist white audience members happy? poor sersi had her entire character development surrounding this beige wall of boring, and she never had a moment to really just be sersi. we also had the added bonus of sprite’s story being intertwined with ikaris’s because she also was in love with him but she could never be with him because she was physically a child, which is incredibly fucked up when portrayed in live-action by an actual young actress. ajax had been dead the whole time because, you guessed it, ikaris killed her for the evils. no wonder salma hayek was angry at the script. i would’ve been too if i were touted as the leader of the eternals but was actually dead the whole time for no real effect on the plot. ikaris was hard to care about from the get-go, and his added disney surprise villain plot twist had me rolling my eyes because of course he would secretly be in cahoots with the celestials. ikaris flying into the sun to kill himself in the end was the stupidest death i’ve ever seen on screen (yes i know it’s a myth of icarus reference) i nearly left the theater in rage. 

eternals isn’t good. please quit fooling yourselves and saying it was. in the end, it revolves around a character we’ve seen a million times: an angsty white male with a god complex.",qn0q4y
hjljhkg,Sprite’s experience is similar to the trans experience. Being stuck in a body and wondering why god made you that way is so pertinent. Sprite’s experience is a metaphor for transitioning and what you give up to live as yourself. I said what I said. 😬🤷🏾‍♂️,qn0q4y
hjh0l8v,"And as expected I knew the reviews were complete bullshit. Everything they outlined as bad was stuff I was excited for.

Who cares if kids would find the film boring, it means they're doing something right as everyone is tired of the childish out of place jokes. 

Some of the most exciting and well done fight scenes in the MCU paired with amazing CGI (we ignore the post credit). Also I loved the historical throwbacks and cinematography. 

Overall one of the better Marvel movies that has come out recently, definite step up over Shang Chi and Venom (which were still enjoyable).",qn0q4y

hjrc09t,"My interest in Marvel movies has been waning, because I don't like the direction they're seemingly headed in.  That being said, I don't think this deserved the review hate that it got.  But then again, Ragnarok got great reviews despite being absolute trash, so reviews don't seem to be worth shit these days anyway.

The movie was a little overstuffed but not jarringly so like Spider-man 3 was.  It had a lot of threads going but I think it tied most of them up pretty satisfactorily.  

The main issue I had with it was that Cersei was able to kill a fucking CELESTIAL in about 5 minutes.  Which is the big problem I'm having from a lot of new Marvel movies; they are giving everything insane power creep.  Shang Chi learned how to use the 10 rings in about 10 seconds and killed a soul sucker from another dimension.  No we have Eternals, who are basically immortal gods, killing all-powerful Celestials and I'm sitting here trying to figure out what the hell they're going to do for challenging villains in the future, and what the fuck Hawkeye (new or old) is gonna do when teamed up with an all powerful god almost as old as time itself?

The special effects were good which was nice as I feel they have been lacking lately.  Characters were interesting, I was glad they managed to include a gay character without making his homosexuality his defining trait.  Druig's power and character was pretty interesting and I don't think they spent enough time there.  I really enjoyed the Deviants, especially the power ups after each kill of an Eternal.  Not enough time spent on them and the 'head Deviant' died way too fast, I would have rather he lived for a sequel or showed up elsewhere.

The after credits were a miss for me, the Eros thing I don't really know or care about and the Black Knight one (with Blade!) was interesting but too short to tell me much since I'm not familiar with the character.",qn0q4y

Chloe’s touch is evident, and it truly elevates the art in my opinion. The biblical allusions were cool, and I’m sure there were allusions to other beliefs but I’m not too well versed in them to have noticed. The multiple reveals/developments throughout the movie were interesting. I liked the action when it happened lol but I was truly invested into the social dynamics of the group.

You literally feel like Sersi hates Kit Harrington's character the whole movie or waiting for Ikarus to reveal his feelings for her. Only that partially happens at the end and then ""surprise"" Ikarus is a murderer who seeks forgiveness and throws himself into the sun.

hjddynw,"Maybe it’s only because I went in with really low expectations because of the bad reviews but I loved it, it’s a top 5 mcu movie for me. 

I felt that all of the characters were developed really well, the standouts for me being Druig, Thena, and Gilgamesh, but I really liked everyone else too. I only wish Mikarri got into the movie a little sooner but oh well. And while I thought the chemistry wasn’t completely there I did buy into Sersi and Ikaris’s relationship and the last moment they had while she was killing the celestial worked for me.

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the action. The fight against the deviants in the forest was really visceral in the way it was shot. I loved how they showcased each eternals powers, they were all used really creatively and in dynamic ways. Phastos, Sersi, and Mikarri really stood out to me here. 

And what shocked me most was that the comedy in this was funnier to me than any other marvel movie. Nothing felt overly forced, and most of the jokes felt like they were there to really showcase the family dynamic between the eternals rather than to just be funny. I also loved the valet, I was nervous that he would be a typical annoying marvel comic relief character but the camera jokes really landed for me and he also had some surprisingly touching moments like giving the prayer at the funeral and his farewell to the eternals.

One not so good thing that stood out to me was that I didn’t feel like the deviant thread was necessary? It definitely could have been, and I was really expecting the sentient deviant to join them at the end, but it sort of fell flat for me. It felt like it was building to something bigger but sort of just ended. Oh well. 

Overall I did really really enjoy it and can’t wait for more of these characters (that last scene left me with my jaw on the floor and the post credits were great).

The reason for not intervening with Thanos is a bit lame. He didn't just blip humans Ajax, he blipped half the universe. Surely the Celestials would have had an interest in not losing populations given that they needed the energy?

The end visuals of the celestial emerging from the earth were really cool to see, just the size of it. Felt like maybe we'd see Kratos climbing it.

Should have included a scene of him and Sersi meeting could have probably built in something with him meeting her while researching his family history making it feel more natural. Never read any of Eternals but knew that Druig is usually a bad guy so was pleasantly surprised at the twist and enjoyed his character the most as he comes across as more of antihero especially because his powerset isn't really geared toward full on heroism so i liked the scene of him using his powers when the deviants attacked his camp using his followers as cannon fodder. Its a little weird, the movie wants you to see him as a good guy and from his actions he obviously cared about them enough to protect them but still he views himself as above them, interesting dynamic imo and really want to see more of him. Enjoyed Ikarus and his heel turn though don't understand why he killed himself felt like a waste for future story potential. Was weird how Kingo just abandoned them near the end and never showed back to help not even for the unimind basically pulling a Sweden. Missed opportunity as he had one of the biggest connections to humans but still believed in the Celestial's plans and would have been interesting to see him overcome that to side with the others in saving the earth. Really liked Makkari's use of superspeed, exactly what I would want to see from a live action Flash, the scene of her pummeling Ikarus was awesome.

hjypzm6,"This movie contained too much exposition for my taste,  I feel like if they need to explain as much as they did, while showing flashbacks of past events they were in, it would have better served the content to be in a tv series form, like FATWS.  I am a big fan of superhero movies, but I just couldn’t really get into it.  I just watched it yesterday and can only remember the names of like 4 characters, which may be more due to some the names themselves being less memorable.  I felt like there was material in the film that could have been left on the cutting room floor without a loss of the plot, and I also felt like there were times that the movie didn’t really know what direction it wanted to go and just dragged along until it could introduce some new plot point to get it to move forward.  I did enjoy the fight scenes and when the tempo of the movie started to pick up, but in my opinion it took to long to reach that point.  
Also plot question: When we meet Makkari in the present time she is already on the ship with tons of books and food. But we had just been shown the ship had been buried with relics nearby, so was she just living by herself underground on the ship for years, and if so how did she get the modern items?

hk45wnv,"I thought the movie was okay (as a stand alone) - not as bad as some ppl seem to be making it.

I thought, it had interesting concepts but the execution was meh at a lot of points. There were moments that didn't add up or went unanswered and there was some set up and pay offs that fell through.

Just an okay movie. I would be inclined to seeing it again for a better assessment but I'll wait until its online somewhere. As a whole in the marvel cinematic realm - it fails spectacularly at upholding what came before it - in fact, it undermines it.

Some major things that irked me: The evolved deviant's storyline was utterly misused. Kingo (?) just peacing out at the end was weak. Why are the Eternals designed in such flawed ways? Like, Sprite being a child and the speedster being mute... if Arishem's goal was to make them like-human then why would he think they would ever follow through with his plan for the Emergence... really, for the cosmic beings to do that - well its one helluva major flaw in their plan.Also, why did the Eternals all go their separate ways? How did they just seem to know where to go to find each other...Lastly, ""Isn't it beautiful?"" Sersi turns to Ikarus - he replies, ""My name is Ikarus"". Lol... K then.

THE BIGGEST ISSUE: The Celestials undermine Thanos' plan and ideals... how can ressources be finite when these cosmic beings can just spawn new worlds... Marvel done goofed with this concept.",qn0q4y

I really appreciated the touches on large topics like existentialism, proof of life and redemption.

long verdict - it is arguably the single best looking marvel film to date. The scale is incredible in some scenes. But the good visuals extend beyond just cgi - the rest of the movie is cinematographically beautiful with natural light accentuating good composition. It is very visually distinct 

even the villains - the deviants - look a lot cooler and more menacing than most marvel hoardes. I can’t remember an mcu film where civilians have been shown outright dying before , and
SPOILER
we lose a couple eternals along the way
. There’s a greater sense of peril in this movie than in previous MCU movies

Negatives; script felt a bit underbaked .. another revision or two to polish it off would have been good. It is a long movie and it genuinely feels like they were trying to fit an entire phase worth of material into one movie 

I like kumail and Angelina Jolie’s characters the most .. jolie lowkey gave a wicked performance that really stood out to me .. wish she had a more central role

hjxruly,"This was probably my most highly anticipated film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Phase Four line-up. Having finally seen it, the end result is... a lot. I will acknowledge that sometimes this film does give off the vibe that it's biting off more than it can really chew, to the point where it would probably work better as a Disney+ series. Not everything about it works... but I don't care. I utterly adored Chloé Zhao's sweeping, meditative, buck-wild ambition here, and while it may not be the best film in the franchise, it's definitely one of the most rich in terms of its characters and emotional core. Like last year with Wonder Woman 1984, this is one of those films where I just can't help but find joy in everything about it, even in its imperfections. The group dynamic is wonderfully done and soulful, the action sequences are nothing short of breathtaking, the performances from everyone (and I mean, everyone) are on-point, Ben Davis' lush cinematography offers a perfect visual mixture of both Zhao's and Marvel Studios' respective styles, the musical score by Ramin Djawadi is easily one of the greatest and most memorable to bless the series, and this even does things I've never seen before in an MCU film, like that there's no real villain here — which I found so refreshing for a film like this. Warts and all, I loved this film with all my heart and it is top-tier Marvel entertainment.",qn0q4y

They had such realistic and easy to follow characterizations like Druig having the ability to stop humanity from killing each other and he lost it from not doing anything. Or how Phastos’ intelligence led to tragedies. They all felt so real. The cinematography was gorgeous, there were some real shocking moments like Ikkarus turning on them, and profound questions where I myself was asking conceptual questions about the course of life and what is right. It was really incredible and the cast did a wonderful job with making me care for them and feeling the tensions when they were high. Great risks were taken with great rewards and this movie makes me so excited about everything to follow. One of the best MCU movies yet",qn0q4y

Sure there’s a lot of action and it’s pretty awesome and really well done. Especially the end scenes on the beach.

Of course, him being a straight white male (who is name-checked as Superman at one point) makes the agenda even more apparent. And his demise, flying too close to the sun, was a little too on-the-nose for my taste. But not entirely unexpected.

Aside from that, I thought it was pretty damn good. Don Lee as Gilgamesh was my favorite character and I'm bummed that he got bumped off so early. Kumail as Kingo was also pretty great and provided much needed comic relief, along with his hilarious valet. I also dug Druig, who seemed to be the most level-headed out of all of them, even though he was largely ignored. It sucks that both Salma and Angelina had mostly scaled down roles as well.

Maybe the worst part for me was the mid-credits scene with Harry Styles. Felt way too distracting, along with CGI Patton Oswalt.

hjdgnhs,"My Review:

&#x200B;

TLDR:

&#x200B;

Pros:

\-Visuals

\-Unique characters and each had an okay story

\-Story is simple and makes sense and answers quite a few questions I had going in

&#x200B;

Cons:

\-Pacing felt off, some scenes could have been shorter, while some scenes could have been a bit longer to really feel impact of deaths/sacrifices

\-Ikiris going into the sun abruptly 

\-weak first half.

&#x200B;

I really enjoyed the movie for what it was. visually, it looked good and I thought the CGI was fine. I also thought the story was pretty good in terms of plot and answering questions and things making sense.

&#x200B;

My biggest problem that I can't overlook is that in a 2.5 hour long movie, it felt like they needed more time for emotions. It felt like when they were getting the band together, there never felt the weight of the previous deaths. Like I get that they have been apart for literally thousands of years, but i'm pretty sure Gilgamesh's death wasn't even mentioned on screen to the speedster. 

&#x200B;

Also I wished they spent more time at the end on Ikaris before he died and I really wanted him to have some dialogue about the heartbreak between living with a purpose for thousands of years but sacrificing it for the person you love, but know that that person cannot love you again. Like Ikaris's ending could have been so much more impactful if we spent literally a few more seconds on him. I had this thought driving home about how much pain he must have been in pain being torn between his allegiance to the celestial and his love for Sersi and to try and save the world, but it was all a thought, and not actually shown since his death was so abrupt. Like I just wished it went on a little bit more. 

&#x200B;

Overall, I felt the second half was better than the first, and the movie surprised me with a few things. I really thought Thena would die and the story itself was actually pretty simple but intriguing. The first half also felt like it would either be to slow without action, but then jump to human characters jumping on board with sending their loved ones/actors to save the world.

>!This is no spoiler my take. I feel like Angelina aka Athena would be better the focus and more of Kit Harringtons' character if he is to have a future role in the MCU.  I think if she  Athena had a child-like in comics would make her stand out as to why she suffered because she felt emotion and bond to humans first. I think another name would have made a better movie then Chloe but she is a small director but everyone will know her name and its Deborah Chow when her Kenobi Series comes.!<

>!I think Chow could pay homage to past MCU and make something new. Chloe made this film too much unlike what makes the MCU connective tissue work.

There were things I liked and didn’t like about the film but one thing I did really like is that they showed these “eternal” beings as actually growing over the years and learning that humans can be good/bad long before the start of the movie’s plot.

Usually, characters of this nature are all “oh humans are so terrible for war/killing blah blah I’m going to be a recluse and be bigoted against Homo sapiens”. 

Here, in this film, we have Phastos shown to be optimistic of helping humanity, devastated about nuclear weapons and cynical about humanity, to the present where he has a nuance view of humanity.

Wasn't even funny to me when I'm normally a sucker for that kind of thing, because it was so ridiculous and unbelievably disrespectful.

People are also talking about how Sprite got off easy at the end. Yo fucking Druig mind-controlled a town's worth of people for 20 generations and nobody gives a shit beyond ""oooohhhh hey don't do that, it's not right oh whatever"". Like wtf that's some nightmarish horrifically evil shit. The only choices aren't just kill him or let him do his thing unabated despite his threat otherwise. Lock the bitch up or spend some of the hundreds of years trying to convince him to see reason or something. Jesus christ I had more sympathy for Ikarus there, being the only member to seriously try and stop him, than his zealotry and internal struggle afterwards. How ironic is it that the dude trying to end the world later on would be the only one to seriously try and stop him.

Honestly I'm going all the way back to Seven Samurai, and that was essentially the prototypical ensemble movie.


This was a visually distinct movie, like it was big in the MCU way, but it had some really striking visual elements and artistry behind it. And the story wasn't bad, but it had too many superficial threads without digging into any particular one(the love story between Gemma Chan and the dudes from GoT whose names I forget), the mind control guy who wants to eliminate free will to protect people, Paperboi who is scarred by what his technological uplift has done, the girl who is stuck as a kid, whatever is going on with Angelina Jolie. All of these stories on their own would have worked great as either a primary storyline or as a secondary/supporting storyline, but when you put them all together and you don't have a damn near 4 hour runtime, all of them feel hollow. Kumail Nanjiani  and his Alfred-ji were a breath of fresh air because they were intended as comic relief and you don't need more than 10 or so minutes of comic relief which is good because that's all they were given. They worked because that was really the only plotline that was given the amount of time it called for. The others didn't for me because you're given a taste of what could be an interesting plot without getting the satisfaction of seeing it pulled off.

hmfxkmy,I thought that was going to happen when he immediately attacked Ikaris on the beach. But then the rest of the Eternals attacked it right after. Why would you hinder the efforts of someone that's trying to stop your enemy? It's stupid.,qn0q4y
hjpz7xw,He did try to help them fight Ikaris when Phastos started attacking him right?,qn0q4y
hk8gyfx,"I agree, but I do think they will use the character as an example of a “Deviant Eternal” when we delve more into Thanos’s backstory as one.",qn0q4y
hl7i4kk,i agree but i think they just didn’t have the time for that because they would’ve then had to resolve the conflict between the deviant and thena or thena would have had to go off on her own somehow and create an entirely new story arch. it was a bit lazy but i understand why they did it when there was so much going on already,qn0q4y

hkh2od4,"yeah, I also feel like that was a huge missed opportunity",qn0q4y
hkxzm48,"I was thinking the same thing when he observed the fight. I guess that was also cliche since we all thought of it? I was thinking that since the unibrain wasn't tested and the evolved Deviant already absorbed a few of the fallen Eternals that they would willingly sacrifice themselves to allow for the deviant to kill the Celestial. 


Then, since they are all save stated on celestial land, they could be brought back",qn0q4y
hl6qfwt,"Yeah, I was disappointed by that. Guess it solves the question ""What do we do with him now that Ikaris is gone and the Celestial has been stopped"" since no one has the chance to ask it.",qn0q4y
hlgarhb,It was really weird to give Kro speech and highlight that the Eternals were wrong the entire time... just for them to do nothing with it and have them kill him,qn0q4y
hlvtqwc,"I agree, and the lack of this to me gave the film a very bleak depiction of morality with respect to the eternals themselves.  In fact, I thought the deviants in the end were going to have parallels in the eternels themselves, as the scene in the ice cave shows there's one that can fly (icarus), one that's super powerful like gilgamesh, etc (and they were basically prototype eternals).",qn0q4y
hmpt0wn,"It would have answered one thing that I hated, that being how did he just come up with the unimind and then have it just work like that?! A bit too convenient.


They could have scrapped that and had a scene at the end where they acknowledge their powers combined are what's needed and trust the deviant to borrow their powers and stop the... thing from happening.",qn0q4y

iah7va3,"I think the deviant's actions, his fate are quite fitting to main theme of the story, which is, I think, is about how unrestrained emotions lead to global and personal disaster.

Humanoid deviant was not led by absorbed intelligence, no. He was led by uncontrolled revenge. He didn't have time to reflect on the situation with his freshly obtained sentience, and so it was all revenge without a trace of doubts.
And in his final moments he became absorbed in Gilgamesh's feelings, slowing down enough for Thena to come to her senses and kill the enemy.",qn0q4y

hjq7ff1,"yeah the more you get into this movie the more the explanation falls apart on itself.  *maybe* you could say ajak kept it from them because she wanted to delay emergence, but ikaris knew too.  and this was a universe-wide event - half the intelligent life energy *everywhere* went down.  thats a big hit to ol' arishem's revenue.  imagine losing half your networth and saying ""meh, itll bounce back""",qn0q4y

If we guess that she already converted to wanting to save earth prior to the Snap, then she may have actually not told Areshem about it until after the fact - allowing Thanos to snap his fingers under their noses. In her defence she could say that he wasn’t a Deviant.",qn0q4y

The other thing that bothered me is why they didn't just plead their case to Areshem.  Areshem already admitted he made a mistake before with the deviants.  Be like, yo give us like a few decades to relocate this species. They are pretty special. Can we try it a different way this time?
Since I didn't think Areshem was evil. 

Or hey you are super powerful, anyway you can have these things be born without killing the planet and the people?

e.g. teleport every human off, let it be born,  make a new 'earth planet' in its place and teleport all the people back.",qn0q4y

hsljups,"This assumes that Arashem knew Thanos's plan. In which case, Arashem knew Thanos was going to be stopped. But I don't actually know that Arashem knew this. 

* The Celestials might not be monitoring every world, just egg worlds. In which case Arashem very well might not have even known. Remember, he needs to make or receive a phone call to Sersi/Ajak to learn what's going on on Earth. So presumably he's not omniscient. It's not like Thanos made his favorite form of genocide a secret, but Arashem may have seen this as lesser beings fighting lesser beings.  
* Arashem is operating on a time scale of millions of years (probably longer given how old even our own star and galaxy is). Half of Earth's population is still billions more than what it was in Mesopotamia when the Eternals landed. A setback of a few thousand years is meaningless, especially with modern medicine helping humans reproduce and stay alive more easily. 
* Arashem may have even already consulted with one of his eternals to know the outcome of Thanos's plan. If the Celestials can travel between universes then they can see other possible outcomes and determine what will happen in this universe.  

I don't think it's a plot hole. There are many ways to explain it. I mean, think about it. Arashem didn't even want the Eternals to stop the world wars. He doesn't care about the Infinity War. His number one priority is his babies. The Infinity War didn't affect them.",qn0q4y
hsewy0s,Thats when I turned it off. Nothing makes sense.,qn0q4y

Thanos wasn't a threat worth working about, in reality, it wouldn't take that long, maybe a few hundred years, for a population to double so Thanos just slowed things down a bit. 

Remember, Areshem seemed basically only mildly annoyed that earth was saved and a celestial killed. There are other planets with other Eternals.  

The plothole I'm stuck on is why couldn't they detect the frozen deviants using their tech?  That seems like such a contrived limitation.",qn0q4y

ht4yhuu,"Because they wrote his character to specifically draw those feelings out. The ol’ goofy, teddy bear like minor character who serves as a slapstick gag machine to lighten the mood of the movie, but not before giving a final touching and heartfelt goodbye, to make the audience go “awwwh. He was so harmless and funny! But yet, at the very, he cared the most of all.”

It mentioned being able to absorb memories, so I thought it was going to get a million years worth of memories from Thena and that would trigger something, but no.",qn0q4y
hjlbvfs,The sentient deviant conflict definitely should have been a conversation at the climax. They were going in that direction and just gave up on it,qn0q4y
hjo6r4e,"Bro, in the comics Thena and that deviant get married.  Its hella weird on print.",qn0q4y
hjot7ek,I think that small lime by the Indian director/valet guy in Arizona said it all. “We need some action in this movie”,qn0q4y
hjgejty,I too felt that the deviants should join the Eternals. It just makes their conflict pointless after realizing and rebelling against the celestials.,qn0q4y
hjepkv5,It's especially insulting because even from purely an action standpoint a three way battle with Eternals/deviants/ikarus would have been so dope. I was actually hyped when Kro dropped into the fight and then they just immediately go nope let's have thena and him go over here now.,qn0q4y
hjn75w6,yeah. deviants had little to do with the real stakes of the movie. i really wanted to see the fully evolved deviant too. i was surprised it was killed off so quickly by thena. maybe in the next movie they will show an evolved deviant that consumed some eternals on another planet.,qn0q4y
hjqjdt7,"I mean, the motivation was right there: the deviants were built to destroy apex predators which at this point in time *were* the celestials themselves 

The prime deviant shouldve helped fight Icarus and stopped the Tiamuts birth",qn0q4y
hjqye8l,The Deviants were a true red herring. They had nothing to do with anything else and just served as a distraction.,qn0q4y
hjvxt8i,"I was a lot more invested in the deviant successfully eating all of them. Would've made a much more interesting movie, just did not care about any of the eternals. They never built up any emotional stakes.",qn0q4y
hjwfe2i,I think they just needed a CGI monster to fight. They figured people would get bored if there wasn't a fight scene until two hours in.,qn0q4y
hkfk1li,"I thought the deviant was going to absorb Thena and then have the power to heal, tank punch AND create weapons but also 'level up' again in evolution enough to legit join the team and help them fight their creator. Or something like that. Yeah, her just cutting him to pieces was like 'Oh. Oh, okay. Sure, I guess.'",qn0q4y
hjdvqh9,">I almost feel like they could have cut out all the Deviant stuff out of the movie 

Agreed. They could have easily made this film a conflict of conscience and the struggle between the Eternals love for each other, love for humanity, and their collective knowledge of their mission and its purpose.

This could have easily been one of the more philosophical films of the year, and certainly of the MCU, but they just had to fight CGI monsters for the sake of fighting stuff.",qn0q4y
hjgetrq,"I was definitely expecting a Kronos team-up when he came in and whacked Ikaris.

Then… nah, just bad guy stuff.",qn0q4y
hjicmaa,I was really hoping the super deviant joins them in the end during the Ikaris fight.  Like he helps them stop Ikaris because he too wants to stop the celestial from being born.,qn0q4y
hjdzmc9,"I agree, I mean I liked that the deviants served as a distraction, or red herring or what have you, but I wish their arc didn’t fall so flat. Could’ve been capitalized on by having the prime deviant working with the eternals to take down Ikaris considering he ends up just seppuku-ing himself anyway, but I guess they wanted his character to have some redemption? Well, even that still could have happened…",qn0q4y
hjmc9m0,"I mean, you don't really get the emergence plotline until most of the way through the movie, and youdbe missing the twist.",qn0q4y
hjmqh1b,Yeah what was kro gonna even do to stop the emergence just absorb everything?  That was my biggest issue introducing him and doing nothing much,qn0q4y
hjn6kgh,"I thought the Super Deviant was going to join up with them, not gonna lie. Also didn’t it only have the powers of just Ajak and Gilgamesh?

But they did serve their purpose as a red herring pretty well IMHO, both for the movie and in the plot of the movie. Just totally unnecessary for him to show up at the end when him doing so is of no consequence.",qn0q4y
hjszk8u,Cut that you have no expectation subverting. The Erternals set out to kill Tiamut from the get go?,qn0q4y
hk1arly,"I felt like the Deviants worked well as a way to get some early action scenes and as red herring villains until the Ikarus reveal, but the whole subplot with the sentient power-stealing deviant felt pointless.  By the time it started talking, we got the Ikarus reveal shortly afterwards and the whole plot shifted to be about Ikarus and Tiamut and then they just sort of shoehorned in Thena versus the deviant to wrap up the loose end.

They could have cut out the whole thing with the super deviant, otherwise kept the action scenes with the Deviants early in the movie, and then once it's revealed that the Deviants had only returned because of Tiamut melting glaciers they were trapped in, just kind of treated that as a solved mystery.",qn0q4y
hl7w7d5,"I thought they were gonna use the deviant to succ them and stop the celestial that way, as a different type of ""unimind"" since there's a definite mention of ""they're just like us"" but he did kill two eternals, so I can see the ""use our power to stop him, and give us back our powers after"" wouldn't really work.",qn0q4y

hjjjiv3,Definitely felt like they needed stronger chemistry to sell the Sersei and Ikaris love. They obviously look great together but when you're condensing a thousands of years love story into 3 hours and that love causes a key dilemma in back end of the film you need some electric chemistry to sell it.,qn0q4y

Supposedly he struggles with human morality with all its conflict but the dude literally runs a cult of slaves for centuries separating them from the rest of humanity and their families for eternity?

 Can't he honestly see that he isn't different at all from the rest of humanity in trying to control everyone through power for his own purposes?

 Just because human kings don't have magical powers that can force everyone to obey them without question suddenly makes them bad people but not himself? At least the human rulers can't remove people's free will and ambitions. Druig doesn't about human freedom.",qn0q4y

hjgtl4r,"Arishem was definitely a highlight of the film for me. Those early scenes where Ajak uses the orb to communicate with him and the whole screen becomes a wall of red (i.e. a close-up of his face and eyes) were wonderfully intimidating. I'd loved to see more Celestials beyond the brief glimpses we got, but I'm sure it'll happen someday - imagine how imposing a [whole Host of them](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/marveldatabase/images/5/58/Celestials_%28Race%29_from_Uncanny_X-Men_Vol_2_3_001.png/revision/latest?cb=20111229101556) would be on the big screen! 

I am curious why his final design appears different from the more comic-accurate [concept art](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-495ad1644cc59b5f2b39b9d61a1a8666). Perhaps they wanted to link him to [the Celestial](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelcinematicuniverse/images/b/b7/Esonsearcher.png/revision/latest?cb=20141126104220) depicted destroying a planet with the Power Stone in GotG (previously believed to be Eson the Searcher), or maybe they just preferred the visuals of the 6 eyes.

I'm glad they went with a more elongated, alien design for the Celestials. The comics and the GotG scene depicted them with human-ish proportions, like they're just really big humans in metal suits. But the final design feels even more otherwordly and intimidating. I'm very keen to learn more about MCU Celestials and how they fit in with its cosmology.",qn0q4y

hjo18rb,"Actually the crux of the movie just need Ikaris still be in love with Sersi and is willing to transitive that love to humans as a whole, and I think it showed plenty of that in the present day. 

The problem is people expect Sersi to reciprocate based on how the movie is marketed , but the film itself never actually want that particular relationship to work again in modern time. There’s a huge gap between expectation and reality there.",qn0q4y

Black Widow was stupid and dull. Eternals was just dull, it wasn't bad enough to enjoyably mock, it wasn't good enough to be memorable in any conceivable way.

hjn5wtv,"I agree and disagree. I do wish there could be more time to devote to going in depth with their story throughout history, but there’s nothing standing in the way of Marvel greenlighting a Disney+ series of just that. Meanwhile, this movie takes my money as the best looking of the entire MCU - some of those shots, like the first in South Dakota, we’re astoundingly beautiful and really showcased the scale of the movie well, and was something only possible by this being a movie not a TV show.

But yeah FATWS could’ve used some fat trimming and story tightening that would‘ve come from a shorter runtime.",qn0q4y

We know the Eternals now, the next one just needs to beef up Sersi who felt like she didn’t have much of an arc, let us meet the proper Thena and introduce Starfox, Pip and probably Mentor. It’s a much easier task.

I’m genuinely interested to see the trial of the celestials and given that the Eternals are essentially robots I’d be keen to see a rebooted and antagonistic Ajak and how the others deal with that.

hjfff98,the bigger question is why the celestials didn't do anything about it. they OBVIOUSLY have access to nearly unlimited power AND thanos directly threatened them.,qn0q4y
hjlwldf,"I think because the Thanos snap doesn't affect too much on their time scale. It'll probably take a couple hundred years at most for the population to restore to where it was pre-snap. If the Celestial had been in earths core a billion years whats another couple hundred even to the eternals that would be no time at all. 

Now why they didn't get involved in stopping dormammu I don't understand. He was going to eat the earth and I would assume that means the celestial inside earth as well. That would completely destroy everything they were there to do",qn0q4y
hjfelwh,"Someone said in another comment, all these fights happen in a short amount of time. In Infinity War, Thanos is on Earth for maybe five minutes when he does the Snap. And also consider, it happens in Wakanda, the secret African country that very few people know the location of.  With all of the Eternal spread across the world, and Makkari (speedster) just chilling on the space ship buried underground in Iraq, what can they realistically do? And even in Endame, it’s the same scenario. How are they supposed to know that 2014 Thanos has traveled to 2023?",qn0q4y
hjh9u9q,Thanos did not make his plan public to everyone. Eternals are not omniscient and were separated.,qn0q4y
hjqu86b,"This was my biggest issue too. Arishem wants more humans so that they can feed the baby celestial inside Earth. Thanos wants to decimate the population of half of the entire universe.

Also Arishem: ""lol it's chill guys let's just have Thanos do his thing and set us back thousands upon thousands of years""",qn0q4y
hjmt8os,"Yeah…they really needed to ease into the Celestials. There’s a small window to do some of the intergalactic Marvel universe stuff, and to get really crazy with the multiverse…but it has to be done slow. Rushing leads to unanswered questions, or poorly answered questions, or weak characterization (I’m looking squarely at the DCEU, who somehow fucked up Superman and Batman, their flagship characters). 

This stuff takes a weird director, someone who embraces the odd blend of campiness and epic proportions that permeated the comic scene in the 70s and 80s, which led to some of this crazy shit. I argue Gunn and Waititi each had success here, to a degree, because they understood how to cultivate that into a coherent story that the audience accepts. 

This doesn’t do that. It skips steps. I think I see hints of Zhao’s vision…immortal beings struggling to come to terms with an ethical decision with no right answer, coupled with their own struggles about their existence…but there’s no space to explore that, because there’s so many shoehorned conflict elements, and moments of tragedy that feel unearned (I feel sad for Gilgamesh and Theena *because*…?). 

And then we come to reasonable questions like yours. A slower paced film could have addressed this better. Maybe because they were separated they didn’t notice Thanos coming…maybe it’s a point of tension for the group that gets better explored than, like, two lines in the movie…who knows.",qn0q4y
hjg1cfh,"People giving excuses are people just coming up with bullshit to excuse this. How is a threat from ANOTHER PLANET the same as humans fighting with each other? Even if you ignore the whole fact that Thanos was a UNIVERSAL threat, not an earth specific threat, it still makes no sense.

Phastos can give tech to humans to help the progress but the Eternals can't stop threats from other planets? Bullllllshit.",qn0q4y
hjfwf1y,"This is NOT intended as a “Thanos was right” argument, and snapping half of everyone away is a DICK move to sentient beings especially, but….it’s not an extinction-threatening move or anything.  It’s not Dormamu destroying reality, or even Ultron extinguishing a species.

It’s a lot more death in raw numbers than some threats, but it’s one that is specially designed to be bounced-back-from if you’re taking a long view, which presumably Eternals are…",qn0q4y
hjmoudx,Yeah. They really messed up on the Thanos topic. It just made them look unlikeable and lazy lol,qn0q4y
hjel5s2,"There are many things to ponder. First, the Eternals directive was basicly to ""shepperd"" humans to the point a Celestials would feed from they. So the Blip wasn't something they should be concerned. In fact, as some already pointed, Thanos plan would delay the Celestial egg from hatching. But note this: IN THE COMICS Thanos is an Eternal ( but looks like he did because he had a deviant gene). In the end, his brother Starfox is presented. So if Marvel leans to keep this ""origin"", part of the reason probably lied in the fact that since the ""blip"" was caused by another Eternal and probably everybody assumed he was doing the work Celestials asked him. But I think the truth lies in the fact Eternals are robots/synthezoids ( like Vision). In the end they probably were not programed to respond Thanos or any treat that contradict the Celestials plans directly. But it's also problematic beecause, at this point in the MCU would make sense Thanos being a Robot ? How a Robot has a ""brother "" ? Does Starfox also not know he's a robot ? And in the end could Thanos know that if killed half of the population it would delay the growth of the Celestials eggs around the Universe and that in reality was his mission ? After all Thanos should be an Eternal.",qn0q4y
hjidzcd,"Dude the answer is when they were making Infinity War, they didn't plan on the Eternals. It is a movie.",qn0q4y
hjh20gt,It doesn't even make sense for the Chitauri that army was Thanos's army. After Loki took earth for Thanos the Mad Titan would have culled half the population like in all his conquests.,qn0q4y
hjhlbqo,"I mean.. I think they just stayed out of it. I don't think they were listening in on every word that Thanos was saying, and making a real time analysis to interfere. They just did their own thing.",qn0q4y

hjr0fb6,"I was annoyed when they said Thanos was a ""human problem."" Um, you mean the guy who successfully killed half of all life in the universe? He's not worth breaking your vow over?",qn0q4y
hkgplsc,the way i’m thinking of it is that they couldn’t have known about it until it was too late much like how the remaining avengers didn’t know about the celestial being born until it was probably too late,qn0q4y

Strange is relatively new to this job. I guess he doesnt have a good enough spy network to be alerted when stuff like this happens, but he is probably working on it.

The Deviants never made any sense at all to me, not even after being explained, and they never even tried to explain why celestials required “intelligent life” as “food”… they didn’t even consume them in any way, they just existed on the planet surface, so… why?

But the story of the Eternals themselves, their struggle and awakening, the morals of it all, that was great. Was it just me, or could the whole story more or less be a metaphor for abortion rights, with humanity being the woman and the celestial being the fetus? It was all about the right of the woman/humanity to have a choice and be allowed to choose to survive, even if “potential future Einstein” would then never be born. 

Tone-wise, the film was way too serious and somber, making the genuinely funny moments stand out in kind of a bad way.",qn0q4y

Part of me was expecting him to swoop in at some point and save the day by keeping Ikaris at bay, and I was very pleasantly surprised to be wrong.

So your first thought in the trailer is like ""Wtf, these guys suck"" but you wait to see if maybe there's a good reason for their apathy towards half the life in the universe being wiped out.  And then the ""we were just following orders"" defense is a classic Nuremberg tactic that just digs them in deeper AFAIC.

The comics had the same problem. You simply cant expect an Avenger to show up everytime another character has a problem.

That would take away from the main story.

It's why Superman just cant show up in Gotham all the time. He would be able to solve everything with a snap of a finger.

Does it make much sense? Probably not, but you read a Batman comic book to read about how Batman would solve a problem.

You dont read a Batman comic to have Superman overshadow him. 

Likewise, I wouldnt want an Avenger shoehorned into this movie. It was partly my issue with Captain America: Civil War. It felt too crowded.

You could argue that it's an MCU movie, so why not? But to me that's a flimsy argument.

The comics cant have every hero showing up in random comics all the time, even if it seemingly makes sense.

The Guardians and Captain Marvel are out in space. Shang-Chi is new in this business. But for him travelling around and fixing things seems also to be out of his league mostly. Dr. Strange is somewhat the only one with the powers and responsibility, but we will probably learn that he is occupied with other stuff.

I guess when humans were still at the stone age they would be very dangerous but after the invention of gunpowders any small armies could easily beat them, let alone in modern days with our technology. Even cavemen fought and caused the extinction of many, very large super predators. Anyway.

I was also hoping at the end for the deviants and eternals to team up against Ikarus. They even said that they hated the Celestials and their survival was tied to Earth. So why fighting against them?

hjdh1nq,"I definitely thought the film was the most refreshing MCU entry in a long time. I think everything worked together in an organic way pretty well. And also, I didn’t feel like I was watching another hero origin movie at all, like Shang-Chi. Instead, this is the most soulful Marvel entry yet.

What’s unique about this entry was that the heroes were not young nor immature. These characters are definitely not designed to be relatable with many who are under 30 years old. They’re much older and more burdened from life than Captain America or the Black Panther. They’ve seen enough that they all had been humbled and wisen by it…they all made their choice informed by their convictions.

The ultimate choice they had to make, there’s no black and white or right and wrong. Instead, they have to make a choice where it’s both right and wrong, and both life and death, and that they would have to carry the weight of the wrong and hope that their right will be worth it. It’s both selfish and selfless. But they each knew that they have to make it and couldn’t be indecisive.

In one sense, they’re not heroes, but rather, they were just humans. When I see them, I see my friends…I see my relatives…my neighbors.

Icarus was such a tragic character. He had the hardest time leaving who he was behind and wouldn’t abandon his mission. He was the most faithful to the Celestial cause. He didn’t allow himself to change until he realizes there’s no way he can kill Cersei, who filled his life with love and new meaning. Realizing what he has done and what he couldn’t do, he decided death was what he deserves.

The actual 14 year old who played Sprite did an awesome time playing the eternal child who both loves and resents the cards she was dealt with. She wanted to grow up and experience life, but could only watch that happened through her family and the humans she swore to protect.

Thena’s plight was equivalent to having Alzheimer’s, while being the best fighter her illness made her paralyzed from saving the one who loved her the most. On the other hand, Gilgamesh was someone who loved so much he was willing to live under limitations just to take care of Thena and to make every day count.

These characters are not the Avengers, but they don’t need to be. We don’t see them becoming heroes, instead we see them becoming humans. They were eternally perfect, but their connection with mankind made them flawed…so to speak. And by becoming so, they learned to live among us without prejudice.

Let the first be getting to know the eternals leading up to the betrayal and death of Ajak.

When Makkari got the news, I wanted to see the grief for her friend of 7000 years.
That lasted for 2 sec, then she said ""great, I was bored"".

When Gilgamesh got the news he was real sad, but they THROW IN A JOKE?! Let there be time for some sadness!!


Then end the first part with the Sersi learning about the birth of Tiamat.


Then let the second movie be about the arc of the betrayal and stopping Tiamat. These characters are brand new to most of us, and we need some more time!

Like even the fact that where we discover her in the movie is waiting in the spaceship and she’s just like “oh damn I guess I missed a lot” and we don’t really get an explanation of *why* she’s just chilling there is a problem.

Not other celestials but specifically Arishem created them. Deviants keep appearing on each planet eating life/predators/Eternals because he put them there when he 'seeded' the planet for growing a new celestial - to keep other predators in check.

Arishem also sent eternals to each planet he seeded - but only after he realized the deviants would become apex predators and destroy the intelligent life he wanted to grow.",qn0q4y

hjdizp3,"I’m gonna try to answer, but these are my interpretations, maybe others will have better/more correct answers:

1) You’re correct, but I mean, you want us to just be ok with humanity being wiped out? Makes sense to root for them to not explode our planet.

2) Not sure I understand this. Who was ignoring sentient beings? The deviants? I think they were going after everything, but humans are the biggest prey so the biggest target?

3) maybe he just assumed it wouldn’t work? Also since he’s shown to be passing judgement at the end, maybe it’s not all black and white and there’s some wiggle room. He’s clearly at least willing to hear them out.

4) She’s lived as a child for millennia with the mind of an adult (and even so much more than that) yet humanity sees her as a child so she can’t really do anything (be in a relationship with an adult mainly, be a parent like Phastos, having to move every few years as Kingo mentioned because people don’t understand why she’s not aging etc) 

5) I think the deviants motivations were understood toward the end, but mainly they were “bad” because they killed Gilgamesh. Thena wasn’t just going to forgive. They probably could have worked together but the history just wasn’t there. A big part of this movie is that “good” and “bad” are not that simple. Tons of conflicting motivations and resolutions that have validity.

6) they don’t keep making the deviants, once they started evolving out of Arishem’s control, he made the Eternals to do their job (handle apex predators) and also kill the deviants on the planets where they do still exist. The Eternals are “correctly” performing the task that the deviants were originally supposed to do. They’re synthetic versions that can’t evolve.

7) Arishem collects their memories after the emergence, he doesn’t just know all their current memories.

8) I would assume that the Eternals are willing to interfere now if they are so inclined. Which we’ll likely see in future installments

I hope all those at least add some filler info. This movie had a ton of exposition and still didn’t fully explain some things, or had bad explanations, but hopefully this helps.",qn0q4y

Agreed on this. The 7 second scene at the nightclub happens where she can’t dance with the boy and this bothering her was literally never mentioned again until the end of the movie.

hjdkahz,"Just came back for the movie, and I'll try to answer! mind you, these are mostly my opinion, I might be just wrong.

> The movie seemed to want us to root for the eternals to save humans because we are special. But to do this they had to prevent the emergence of the kind of being that creates billions upon billions of planets like earth with sentient species like humans?

Basically, yes. IMO, I think it's a bit of a dick move to kill *currently alive* sentient creatures to create *possible* sentient creatures (I mean, the Celestial dude had to create Deviants to keep predators in check, so clearly the odds of the new-sentient-creatures surviving is not 100%).

> Speaking of sentient creatures, were they ignoring other sentient beings on earth or were they included in what was needed for the emergence to occur?

I'd go with ""humans get consumed by the Celestial, but everyone - except the Eternals connected to said Celestial - gets killed when the Celestial obliterates the entire planet

> I'm totally lost as to why Arishem didn't actively prevent the eternals from stopping the emergence if he can whip them from earth whenever he/she/it wants

Dude was busy? I mean, there wouldn't be an ending if he did that, so, plot rules dictates he didn't.

> I don't understand Sprites motivation of wanting to be human so she can grow? She's essentially lived for millions of years, and has remembered the last 7000. Does she just want an adult body? Wouldn't that change if the emergence happens and they go to a different planet in the bodies that resemble the new species they look after?

I can't answer this one because I honestly do not care, Sprite was the worst character imo

> How were the deviants still bad at the end? They were also trying to stop the emergence in order to save life?? How did the eternals and them not come together?

that Deviant that became sentient was a huuuuuge waste in this movie, imo. he should've totally joined them. he does tell the Eternals he's going to kill them because they were created to kill Deviants, so I guess that's why they didn't join forces. but it was dumb, and he was pretty much pointless. why is a shame, because he was a good character, but alas

> If the deviants were created to destroy the top predators but then became predators themselves, why do the celestial keep making them for each planet they're preparing for an emergence? Or were they s one time creation just for earth? If they were, how are there other eternals?

I didn't understand that either.

> Arishem had all of their memories collected and organized, why does he need to wait to review these 3 eternals before judgement?

He only takes their memories *after* the Emergence, when they go back to the Planet Builder, or whatever the name was. so he doesn't know anything about Earth, yet.

> Under the eternals logic, it's okay for humans to kill each other still? Or will they intervene now that they've peaked behind the curtain?

I think they might take a more active role in *special* circunstances (like, Thanos 2.0 or something), but I doubt they would want to babysit the whole planet. even Druig, who quit the Eternals to try and stop violence and hatred, just kept his little jungle club because he couldn't control everyone.",qn0q4y
hjl7zdh,">How were the deviants still bad at the end? They were also trying to stop the emergence in order to save life?? How did the eternals and them not come together?

hje32my,"First question is a version of the ""trolley problem"".

Sentience is hard to define in terms of ""what a celestial needs"". Sure, if we assume rats are sentient, there probably was enough quantity to birth a celestial a thousand years ago ; however, it seems like they need thoughts and dreams and whatever humans create beyond just survival which the vast majority of animals are concerned about.

I got the feeling that Arishem is somewhat ""hands off"". Seeds planets, drops off some externals, and then goes and plays poker or whatever he does and only came back because his timer went off and he realized his buddy was late.

Sprite has the ability to create illusions, but can't create mass. So she never got to experience ""adulthood"" like the others. Even if she gets to change in the next world, she won't remember it. As far as they all know (until the last two acts), this 7000 years are their entire exitance, so the millions of years dont matter.


Bad deviants being bad... I don't know. That does really seem like a missed opportunity. However, we're already at 2.5 hours, adding another storyline about how they're now friends and trying to resolve that could easily add a other 10-20 minutes.

Yeah, it seems like the deviant bug would have been solved in the first few beta versions, yet somehow they're still around after millions of eternal years later. Maybe earth is just really really slow, and the deviants were introduced with the dinosaurs and it wasn't until 7000 years ago that they had to introduce the eternals patch. Other eternals would make sense in a ""newer"" world where there are no deviants, but still need eternals to protect/guide the species.

At this point, they will probably start interfering. They were told not to, so they just obeyed.

Awesome questions, got me thinking about the movie more than I expected!",qn0q4y
hjodxgt,"There's been lots of sentient life in this universe, but the film asks you to consider human potentiality and the ways that our similarities and differences weave a tapestry that resembles something beautiful and unique--something like the human condition. Our capacities for discord and destruction are great, but our strivings for understanding and creation are equally great, if not more so.  As a human, do you not feel that?    


Arishem could only communicate with the Eternals through the sphere, I don't think he knew what was going on until after it happened. He arrived to judge them for the actions and the worthiness of humanity.

I think that Sprite wants to feel like a part of this thing that she could only see from the outside. To be forever young is to never grow old with someone that you love. You're kept outside of the pain of adulthood and all of the wisdom that comes from surviving it, yet you're not as vulnerable as a child nor as innocent. It's like being trapped between two worlds. I think that the form that she is in is eternal, it only impacted her negatively as she had lived among humans and saw them become something that she could not.

The deviants were not trying to stop the emergence. The lesser deviants were driven by instinct and the powerful one was motivated by revenge.  It wanted to kill the Eternals and take what made them special, but I don't think it cared whether the world lived or died. It was the last of its kind--to its knowledge anyway.

I believed that Deviants were the first solution. They likely served their purpose for millennia, then they began to evolve. Thus a secondary solution was introduced. The Celestials now had a two-step process. They weren't interested in fixing the Deviants. It was an equation to them, one that came to the same outcome.

Arishem keeps their memories of previous lives on previous worlds, ones where they haven't been compelled to disobey. Their memories have historically served as a way to monitor Deviant evolutionary patterns and behavior. Their current memories are inside of them, but this time the value is not in their knowledge of defeating deviants but rather their experiences of living among humans.

Well most of them are gone, but I imagine that they would want to take on a caretaker role, but not an authoritarian rule. Free will is important to them. They wouldn't stop the every day atrocities that occur, but they would likely intervene against war and genocide.",qn0q4y

Zhao's direction was fantastic (all that natural lighting really helps set this film apart from your standard MCU flick) and the emotional/moral quandaries the characters face was a very nice change up from the standard Marvel stuff. I enjoyed those aspects of the film the most, and it's what kept me hooked and interested. I'd love to see Marvel break that formula way more often and actually try to push themselves thematically and visually. These films need to have their own identities and feel like they can stand on their own, which I fear too many MCU films are failing to do.

Yeah, his story felt really tacked on. And it's a shame because he could have added more to the plot with his angle of being a ""forgotten child"" of Arishem.

Plus, they got Bill Skarsgard for the role and he had, what, 10 lines?",qn0q4y
hjd9ize,"Honestly I really thought for the amount of characters they had to introduce in the short amount of time most of the characters felt pretty well rounded. The one character that I felt wasn’t well thought out and was the center of attention was Sersi as well as her and Ikaris’ love story. 

I feel like I didn’t care enough about her or their “love” to really feel heartbroken about the betrayal. For 5,000 years of being in love their story fell flat. Honestly thought Druig and Makkari had more chemistry in their 5 minutes of flirting.",qn0q4y
hjdf17n,"> but I also love history and mythology so maybe that's why?

Same. I literally thought “Ah, the Midas touch” when Sersi first transformed the spear. Then Kit Harrington says the same thing.

In terms of history and mythology, it was interesting to see how they now intersect in the MCU. We know Asgardians came to the planet in the past, shaping culture, so now we can imagine all the ways Eternals influenced “our” history as well.",qn0q4y
hjdi3dr,"Here is what I posted earlier as a reply, this is why I thought this film is so good:

I definitely thought the film was the most refreshing MCU entry in a long time. I think everything worked together in an organic way pretty well. And also, I didn’t feel like I was watching another hero origin movie at all, like Shang-Chi. Instead, this is the most soulful Marvel entry yet.

What’s unique about this entry was that the heroes were not young nor immature. These characters are definitely not designed to be relatable with many who are under 30 years old. They’re much older and more burdened from life than Captain America or the Black Panther. They’ve seen enough that they all had been humbled and wisen by it…they all made their choice informed by their convictions.

The ultimate choice they had to make, there’s no black and white or right and wrong. Instead, they have to make a choice where it’s both right and wrong, and both life and death, and that they would have to carry the weight of the wrong and hope that their right will be worth it. It’s both selfish and selfless. But they each knew that they have to make it and couldn’t be indecisive.

In one sense, they’re not heroes, but rather, they were just humans. When I see them, I see my friends…I see my relatives…my neighbors.

Icarus was such a tragic character. He had the hardest time leaving who he was behind and wouldn’t abandon his mission. He was the most faithful to the Celestial cause. He didn’t allow himself to change until he realizes there’s no way he can kill Cersei, who filled his life with love and new meaning. Realizing what he has done and what he couldn’t do, he decided death was what he deserves.

The actual 14 year old who played Sprite did an awesome job playing the eternal child who both loves and resents the cards she was dealt with. She wanted to grow up and experience life, but could only watch that happened through her family and the humans she swore to protect.

Thena’s plight was equivalent to having Alzheimer’s, while being the best fighter her illness made her paralyzed from saving the one who loved her the most. On the other hand, Gilgamesh was someone who loved so much he was willing to live under limitations just to take care of Thena and to make every day count.

These characters are not the Avengers, but they don’t need to be. We don’t see them becoming heroes, instead we see them becoming humans. They were eternally perfect, but their connection with mankind made them flawed…so to speak. And by becoming so, they learned to live among us without prejudice.

Yeah, this is not a movie where you watch and escape, but this movie constantly reminds us the tragedies and difficulties of life.",qn0q4y
hje0qqx,"I think a big part of ""why"" it works is that by this point we have established that ""superheroes"" exist, and then we are shown that these are practically demi-gods; so we don't need 60 minutes to explore what makes each of them tick. It's ""they exist, they beat the bad guys cause they're awesome and now they're chilling with humans; and this is their newest story"". Compared to every other marvel origin story where they go out of their way to humanize the hero and tell us why they deserve to be heroes.",qn0q4y

hjeyusq,"I thought that was kinda funny, but was also glad for less subtitles to read because I'm lazy.

If they had their 'own' language to speak, then an entirely new alien language would needed to be developed just for those scenes, as well as a sign language to go with it.  

And then you'd get people whinging about how 'why don't they speak their language when it's just them and they're not around humans?'  Because there's always that minority that gripe about that sort of minor stuff.

Hope that explains somewhat why people hated it. I don't really hate movies, but I did think it was bad and could not wait for it to finish while watching it.

Romance is an absolute chore to sit through in most every movie, so I'm always happy for there to be a bare minimum of it. In most films it's pointless and fills up time. I'd much rather see time invested in furthering the actual plot, or friendships between characters, than ""I am attracted to you. You are attracted to me. Let us do the sex.""

My favorite example is Lord of the Rings is such a great movie trilogy because it's barely there at all in favor of forging friendships, and The Hobbit suffered greatly for its unnecessary love triangle when they could have fleshed out the cast instead.",qn0q4y

Also Sersi...It really felt like a lot of why her character sucked was because in flashback scenes you only really see her through Ikaris’s perspective, where she’s off doing Manic Pixie Dream Girl things like, idk, getting along with women and children and being this perfect domestic incel dream that really only serves as a crutch for Ikaris’s “oh no I am no longer a robot I am in Love!” crisis. It was so weirdly creepy I was rooting for Dane the whole time just because he wasn’t Ikaris LOL.

Cersei: It's beautiful, isn't it?

Ikaris: I'm Ikaris.

hjh0qp2,">The bad: it’s way too long. There’s too many characters.

Kind of a conundrum right? Its longer because it has more characters and needs the time to develop them. Imagine trying to do the LoTR movies with only 2-2.5 hours. It would of hurt the same way. I agree though, too many characters. It needed to be longer, or cut the characters.

>Richard madden was so stiff I didn’t give any shit about his character or his betrayal.

I mean, he didn't betray anyone, he stayed on course. The others were betraying. That being said, I feel like most of the characters were stiff no? Especially Druig, but I think this is how they were written, not so much the acting.

These are people who been with humanity since the beginning. They are tired and bored of them. Especially Druig who wants to help, but just sits there and watched them kill each other constantly. Only Sprite Gilgamesh and Phastos had any real personality. I blame the writers there, not the actors.

>Lauren Ridloff was given zero character development, she was just there, this felt like a token disabled character and I think that’s too bad, they really underutilized this character.

I think this falls back into ""speedsters are too overpowered"". So much of movies can be skipped and ignored with their powers if they are around. She could of solved almost anything that went on in the movie nearly instantly. There would be no movie.

>just leaves, says peace I’m out and turns up after the final battle like he helped. Like why wouldn’t they have him comeback, have a change of heart, and join the battle.

What was he supposed to do. He says he agrees with Ikarus, but he wont fight them. So his only option is to let it play out without interfering. He wanted what Ikarus wanted, he just didn't want to fight. What could be done in this situation except completely changing his decision to something else? I feel like maybe you missed the weight of the decision. A character who truly conflicted with what he needs to do and couldn't make a choice. One that may have consequences later.",qn0q4y

Them realizing their purpose and fighting to live is a micro version of what the whole movies theme. I like some others here mentioned, appreciate the character and decision based focus of this movie and the Deviants simply wanting to exist and at an intersection of a few Eternals thought, serve their initial purpose, which in itself was valid.

I remember a specific example - the entire scene that ends with them fucking - they had switched between 3 different *close* shots during their ""walk"" that were just useless. It didn't ""set the scene"" because the scene kept changing, there was no dialogue, and there wasn't any purpose to the actual walk...

There were like 15 Eternals, and only two of them were given any personality at all. What ""personality"" they got were actually dumbed-down gender roles, if you think about it. There was the ""leader"" who was basically the mom, full of compassion and stupid platitudes, who sees a lot of momness in Gemma Chan because I guess she just *loves* so darn much; that's totally a substitute for an actual personality--she loves so much she makes Richard Madden fall in love with her when they are BOTH basically cardboard cutouts, Angelina is craaaaaazy amirite, and Sprite is a jealous backstabber LITERALLY way to GO with meaningful representation for the girls, Eye Dude is controlling, smart tech guy is smart and does tech like dudes do, strong guy is very strong and protective like dudes should be, and Indian guy has a big ego. Deaf girl doesn't do anything except steal and I guess(?) love creepy eye dude for no reason whatsoever. At least tech dude and Indian dude were allowed to have personalities. Well, I guess *someone* had to. 

I can't get over it. I'm actually angry over how dull and stupid this movie was. The actors are all very pretty, some of the scenes had visually lovely stuff, but jesus christ that makes for a boring movie. 

I still have no idea what the attraction was between Gemma and Richard. Neither of them was given a single interesting personality trait. ""Hi, I have teeth, and also eyes. I see you also have eyes, and teeth. I like this. Your symmetry comforts and pleases me. Let's mush our bodies together in some semblance of lukewarm lovemaking and pretend it has created an epic bond between our blandnesses.""

I felt like the directors told Richard, ""Hey, you are actually the bad guy, but the audience can't *know* that right away, so just make them wish you would die so by the time we tell them you're bad, they already want to see you get thrown into the sun."" 

Oh, and then Gemma Chan saved us all by being *so* pretty and loving that she changed the bad guy so he didn't want to hurt her (GREAT FUCKING LESSON FOR THE LITTLE GIRLS, YO).

They also have a tendency to end musical numbers in their animated movies with the singer getting thrown forward or backward and going ""Woah!"", First Time in Forever and the Moana song where she tries to leave in the boat (can't remember the name for the life of me) being two more recent examples.

Disney just sucks at letting whatever mood they're trying to set just sit for a second.

It was far better than BW (which I think is one of the weakest MCU movies) and on par if not better than Shang Chi. I'd give it a solid 8/10. The acting, direction, VFX, and design were all excellent, and while I found the pacing just a bit off with all the cuts between the different time periods, the story actually worked really well for me. I loved all the questions this movie asked with its themes of love, family, and of course humanity. Another comment I read really said it best. This movie works well because for a tale about literal celestial beings, it provided one of the most human stories in the MCU.

I realized how shitty some of the pacing and writing was, but the way Zhao handled the characters and visuals, as well as the marvel world building, really redeemed it for me. I think people just legitimately liked some of how it was executed. And some weren’t able to get around some of the shittier aspects, or didn’t interpret some of the nuance in the same way as those who liked it. Which is fine in either case.

hjsuo8c,This was my exact gripe as well. The movie ends up being 2/3 of the way done before the plot actually progresses forwards and suddenly you're at the end battle. It reminded me a lot of Fant4stic (2015) where nothing really happens till the last 8 minutes where there's a huge battle and then the movie ends. I was almost begging for the story to move forward and stay in the present timeline after a certain point.,qn0q4y

I felt as if the movie was good for the first half (the sequences in the past were way more interesting than the ""getting the band back together"" present day stuff), but once Sersi activated the magic exposition ball and it became an obligatory ""save the world"" story nearly halfway through that's when it lost me.",qn0q4y
hjjd3pr,"I dont think he necessarily changed his mind, i think he was just literally not able to hurt sersi and so there was not much he could do but give up, you see him trying to shoot laser eyes on her but not being able to keep the fire in his eyes a few times (i did not care for them as a couple at all but i really enjoyed his acting there and seeing the struggle reflected in his eyes like that). so yeah i think that was it when push came to shove he wasnt capable even tho he wished he was",qn0q4y

Chloe Zhao & Fred Jones

It means that some of the work is credited to Zhao and some of it to a writing team she was half of.

This is almost entirely what I said when I left the theatre to my ex.  Had they kept it in 5000-3000 BCE the movie would have felt so much more coherent.  Leave the plot of this film for film 2 or even 3.  They just defeated their big bad in the first film...where do you go from here?",qn0q4y

But, I don't blame anyone for not picking up on that because the timeline of their relationship is totally inconsistent. They were together 5000 years, no it's 1500, they broke up 100 years ago, no it's 500. It's not totally clear either when Ikaris found out or when they broke up, but that was certainly the understanding I came away with.",qn0q4y

I liken directing one of these movies as driving a bus. They need to reach the destination while hitting certain bus stops. They can drive it with some creativity for route selection or driving style, but they need to hit predermined points along the way.

The gifting of the ring to Jon Snow. The entire inclusion of Jon Snow. The Prime Deviant. Kingo's valet. These all felt like Zhao had to fit those ""stops"" into the movie.

The killing of the Prime Deviant did feel like Zhao didn't like the whole idea of it. So she just included him where she was told to and killed him off unceremoniously. At the earliest opportunity.",qn0q4y
hlf2gp7,Just watched the movie so sorry for the late reply but I think the evolving Deviant was a late addition to the script. Hell maybe the Deviant's being involved in present day was a late addition in general. The reason I believe this is because they really wanted to keep Ikaris as the secret villain and the realized they needed some action padding on the middle of the film as well as something to distract audiences from thinking Ikaris was behind killing Ajak. If you remove them from the present day plot not much else changes. If they just presented Ikaris as the villain early on the action scenes could even play mostly the same.,qn0q4y

hsgpyyi,"Half of human life was gone in the blip. 8 billion down to 4 billion. Earth was reduced to the population of 1974. I doubt the half century it would take for humans to grow back to 8 billion even register for Arishem.

Idk if they knew the snap was going to take place just that it happened and how if they had been permitted to interfere it never would have. I took that as ajaks motivation. That earth was worth it since they had saved half of all the universe. She didn't think so prior to that.

hjuov8b,"If Areshem had that much foresight, you'd think we would have foreseen the Eternals betraying him.",qn0q4y
hlpyp94,"I really don't think it's all that complicated. 

The Eternals team was completely split up by Infinity War. Even if Arishem somehow was paying attention to Thanos (why would he be?), he'd make the call to Ajak and Ajak would rally the troops? You saw how long it took for the team to get back together (about half the movie) and the Deviants were their main mission too. The snap would've already happened by the time the Eternals got to Wakanda. And there's no telling the Eternals would even put a dent in a 5 stone-powered Thanos. 

What's most likely is Arishem either doesn't care or doesn't know about Thanos. Thanos assembled those 5 stones at an extremely rapid pace. He had planned and calculated these moves for a while. Get in and get out before any of the big players knew what happened. Sure, he had a bit of luck along the way. 

Also, Sersi's answer to Dane could've been totally made up by her based on her teachings as an Eternal for 7000 years. She's never spoken with Arishem at this point so she only knows what Ajak has told and taught her. On the other hand, it's possible that Ajak relayed a fake message to everyone after the snap so they didn't feel emotional about not being there in Wakanda.

Why didn't the Eternals interfere with Ego's plan to take over Earth? Why not jump in during the battle of New York? Or the 50 other MCU movies where the planet or galaxy was in danger?  They simply weren't designed to be that kind of team and they get their orders from off-world. Even if they had the capability to do so, there's no guarantee they'd be ready to be launch into a battle anywhere in the world in 5 minutes. Heck, even the Avengers don't do that in most of these movies.",qn0q4y

It was all a glaring reminder that they’re not normal humans and they never felt like it while watching imo. 

Ikarus was torn between his love and his original duty. It makes sense that he’s v reserved and restrained throughout the movie. You can even see it in the way the others talk about him. He’s “the boss” and they all believe he’s the most powerful they never say “Ikarus is so kind, friendly, intelligent, etc.” he’s got the reputation as the best fighter.

hjtja11,"Was Tiamut *in* the core of the planet, or built as he came out through the crust? 

The latter would make more sense, to the effect of the island breaking apart and sinking. I mean, once that Sersi took the energy of the emergence that was coming to her (and the other Eternals) through Tiamut, she stopped him and he turned back into inanimate stone - it looked like marble.. The Celestials look kinda rock-like.. Like crumbling, formed cement.

It was stated that the *minds* of the people on the planets was what sprang the emergence into motion.

My thoughts are that the Celestials need the mental energy of higher evolved life to form a base intelligence for themselves, and the planet is the raw material and nothing happens *until* there's a large enough population for the Celestial to feed on as it's born. 

That works with why the Eternals weren't supposed to interfere with domestic human squabbles.. If a species is so violent that it destroys itself, it will never be fit for a Celestial to grow from.",qn0q4y

hjiu0zp,"The movie, Chloe, and the MCU are not labeling Ikaris a bad guy. He plays an antagonistic role because he’s going against the group, but no one is calling him a bad guy. The movie goes out of its way to explain the strife and heartache Ikaris experiences when committing to his directive. He cries because he had to kill Ajak, he makes an elaborate plan to distract the group with deviants but he also makes sure to protect them from the deviants. He also goes as far as to not immediately begin to fight them in the ship! He allows them the chance to stay away from the emergence so he doesn’t have to fight them, and gives them a choice to fight him or not. 

And I’m sure there are some behind the scenes stuff that went into Kingo not fighting at the end, but allowing Kingo to say “I agree with Ikaris but I don’t want to fight any of my friends” was another instance in which the film took measures to not label anybody anything. It’s really just two group of people that have different beliefs. Each belief is as important to one group as the other, neither belief is upheld as the “right” one. They discuss the morality of it all multiple times in the movie, and Kingo’s valet Karun acts as a stand in for the audience when he says “I’m a human so I’m a little biased”. We humans are going to obviously sway in the direction of “humans alive good, humans extinct bad” in some way or another, but the film offers a cosmic perspective in which the answer isn’t an easy or simple answer. We only get the outcome that happens because of Ikaris loved Sersi, and he was so distraught that every sacrifice and hard decision he made meant nothing in the end that he killed himself.",qn0q4y

Did ASL (and other sign languages) come from the Eternals? Are they all fluent in every language since Kingo communicates with Makkari as soon as they arrive on Earth? If so, why do they make a point that Ikaris is learning the native language during the Babylonian scene? Kingo translates Makkari’s sign language to the traders in Babylon, so she is speaking ASL that is presumably unintelligible to humans at that point in history. Sersei and Ikaris speak (presumably) English before they arrive on Earth, did they seed this future language along with ASL?

I would say that they had some kind of universal translator installed (being synthetic beings), but that doesn’t make sense if Ikaris is learning human languages, and by extension all the Eternals are presumably learning/have learnt each language.",qn0q4y

First of all, if he erases their memory then how the hell does the myth spread? Who writes stories about them or makes art if they can't remember them?

Secondly, you don't need to have lapses in memory to spread myths. Myths spread readily enough from mistranslation, the evolution of language, partial losses of text/art or from an incomplete understanding of events.

And lastly, for what purpose? Why do they want to become myths? The only times we actually \*saw\* him using it were to protect the humans to stop them from attacking the Eternals out of fear, to control humans to help fight the deviants and to attempt to sleep Tiamut.

But, I still wanna know the deviants thing. Doesn't make sense for celestials to release eternals to kill them, cos if I'm not wrong - Celestials are really powerful beings?",qn0q4y
hklps65,[deleted],qn0q4y
hsjqjnq,Captain Marvel?,qn0q4y
hjhsjy7,Did you honestly quote that as if no one knows the story?  lol ok mr oh wise one.,qn0q4y
hjhpwpx,"Yes, they said that the myths were even based on the characters. But the problem most people have with this was that it was too on the nose; the Ikaris allusions to Icarus worked fine with his character arc: he became to self-righteous, was unable to see the forest for the trees, and fell. It was relatively subtle until he suddenly threw himself into the sun. It was the one scene my theater broke out in laughter over.",qn0q4y
hjmf8hq,"I thought you were making fun of the scene but then I saw the replies. Icarus and Prometheus are quite literally (and verifiable too) the most used ""tropes"" in history. You can't be serious lol",qn0q4y
hjiku57,:O,qn0q4y
hjins09,I thought the exact same thing!! Lol,qn0q4y
hjlqss3,Always blue!,qn0q4y
hjsk10q,And then returning at the London send off...,qn0q4y
hjygdxt,Now if it was a dance off then he may have stayed.,qn0q4y
hss3mfj,He just can't help but be Dinesh in everything he plays lol.,qn0q4y
hkvijyc,Missed opportunity in not re-casting Martin starr as Druig,qn0q4y
hjlstnf,Sorry a Dinesh?,qn0q4y
hu96zku,He should have had super speed so he could go Ludicrous mode!,qn0q4y
hskb2xx,Now I'm just picturing him at the fight going I'm Kingo. I'm Kingo. I'm Kingo. I'm Kingo,qn0q4y
hji8pe5,"I liked this aspect a lot, and it feels very at home with the Eternals comics. They’re all heroes, they’re all villains, they all falter, and they all save the day. Some of them are certainly more evil than others, but they all have their petty squabbles and hills to die on. They’re a family, and families fight. I love how they handled Kingo, Ikaris, and Druig in this regard",qn0q4y
hjef36r,"I liked it too, since it gave the Eternals feel more heterogeneous. 

I do think the scene could have been elevated if we saw Karun rebuke Kingo for his decision though. Hopefully if they ever follow up this movie, we see Kingo judged for his inaction in some way by Arishem.",qn0q4y
hjhxmvk,He Switzerland that shit hard.,qn0q4y
hjdz5n1,Same here. It was a refreshing take.,qn0q4y
hjfqkm1,It was definitely interesting. They aren't humans and have a different value system. Big battles are just part if their existence and they don't take it personally.,qn0q4y
hk19pqn,"Yeah, from a movie standpoint it felt weird for a character to.juet leave and miss the climax, but at the same time it definitely added depth to the conflict to have a character who didn't take either side.",qn0q4y
hjnbjce,sooo Kumail just straight up reprised his character from the Silicon Valley finale,qn0q4y
hjnfj1v,The could have at least shown him at a Starbucks uni-minding with the rest.,qn0q4y
hjm3ko2,"The problem was it was unearned and just sort of of nowhere. There is a lot drama to be mined in the movie but it never is. Like Sersi coming into a new power, or coming into an even newer power, Ikaris flying into the sun, the sex scene, etc.",qn0q4y
hlcbmt1,It’s like how Switzerland believed in the Holocaust but didn’t want to fight France in WWII,qn0q4y
hjdxqsu,"Which, honestly, I found it refreshing. It’s already a cliché for a character to say they won’t be aiding during the final fight only to appear just in time to save the day. It was one of my biggest criticisms of Black Panther",qn0q4y
hjdz6p1,"Yeah I was so expecting that to happen, but nope. Then they show him later and he is like ""okay we are all good now"".",qn0q4y
hjm66v8,"He believed that they should complete their duties, but unlike Ikarus, he wasn’t willing to fight the people he viewed as his family over his belief. It was a much more respectable decision than just having him heel turn out of nowhere",qn0q4y
hjsiy4r,I genuinely kept expecting the movie to cut to a scene of that happening.,qn0q4y
hjhxxvq,We should just call Wong the Little Dipper since it looks like he does that again in NWH.,qn0q4y
hjm6fsf,"It makes sense really. He held his belief, but he wasn’t willing to fight and potentially kill them over his belief. He still loved them enough to not fight them.",qn0q4y
hjqht71,"He's one of the fighters of the group, and when he's fighting, he completely holds his own.  I was worried they might focus too much on him being the comic relief, but while he's not the strongest of the Eternals, he's got a great power set.",qn0q4y
hjhy1n6,"You won’t be disappointed, I think. I wasn’t.",qn0q4y
hjm6b74,A conscientious objector during war times.  Has an opinion but isn’t willing to fight and kill for it.,qn0q4y

hkipq59,It reminded me of Mr Bean in the movie at the airport lol.,qn0q4y
hjduxpv,I have some bad news..,qn0q4y
hje4fx4,Ajak too right?,qn0q4y
hje11vp,The entire final set piece of the film was absolutely not a “Covid reshoot”,qn0q4y
hjnhwx7,That was my first thought too. Seemed super weird that he just wasn't in most of the 3rd act.,qn0q4y
hjh597e,"He did,once. But I think it was only for a few days because Gilgamesh wanted to go for a holiday in Fiji.",qn0q4y
hjzkfq7,"They weren’t robots. Just built. Remember, the celestials build entire planets

It’s more like the whole Wonder Woman “made from clay” thing.",qn0q4y
hjrp8s9,"I thought there was a line in the movie that he couldn't do it, something along the lines of: [Druig] can't control the mind of an Eternal, what makes you think that [Druig] could mind control a Celestial.",qn0q4y
hjnheg2,Are they robots or engineered organisms? If the are robots they must be like the cylons.,qn0q4y
hjfagqi,The first image Marvel showed of Eternals was their robotic form.,qn0q4y
hjugjhi,I don’t think they are robots,qn0q4y
hjh70lj,"Exactly, though it’s bizarre too that he would be created to stop the deviants with an ability that can’t be used against them",qn0q4y
hjngkcb,God he must have been even more useless on the other planets if he can only control humans.,qn0q4y
hjkba0v,I want to say they did address this. The scene when they went back to the ship and Icarus had shown his true intentions. The audio was low in my theater so I could be wrong.,qn0q4y
hjwoa66,"If he can only control humans, why are they all confident that with the Unimind he can put a Celestial to sleep.",qn0q4y
hjwfhzy,"But he can, at least theoretically, control a Celestial?",qn0q4y
hji0vdl,Gilgamesh said he put Thena to sleep for him while he went on a vacation,qn0q4y
hmxlt93,"Or you could just realise it by watching the movie, which is exactly what you did.",qn0q4y
hjngzvb,Don’t think he made them forget them. Sprite was doing hologram shows for them. What would be the purpose of that?,qn0q4y
hjhsy8p,">Cersei

Sersi. Cersei is GoT lol.",qn0q4y
hjmqzck,"I don't know why he gave up on their original plan so fast! Except because the plot demands Sersi save the day. Sersi used the unimind to do her thing in the end, who's to say Druig couldn't have put Tiamut to sleep for a few thousand years until humans could get into space and then Tia could hatch in peace?

&#x200B;

But yeah, extra dumb for him to just stand there watching her go. At least be a meat shield for if Ikarus catches up. Or, perhaps more in character, jog back and assist Makkari.",qn0q4y
hjljzoj,"Which I’ve considered, however as others have pointed out, there is a line regards Druig putting her to sleep for Gilgamesh and he also offers to do as much during the flashback when her memories first become an issue",qn0q4y
hjm3wsh,The film never offers a direct explanation and we’re left with contradictory statements throughout the screenplay that confuse whether he can or cannot use his abilities on the other Eternals,qn0q4y
hjwoog9,"The film doesn't offer direct evidence that Druig cannot use his abilities on the other Eternals - there are even instances of him being suggested to sedate Thena. Sprite's illusionary powers also work on the other Eternals despite illusions being a cognitive altering ability.   


The issue exists too because the film has changed the nature of the Eternals (being robots) without addressing elements such as the effect of Druig's abilities  


The Deviants are not ever addressed as having no mind - very little is explained of them other than that they became predators themselves and their evolution within the film (presumably the changed design in the Eternals being robots emerged from the issues affecting the Deviants)",qn0q4y
hlfsmv7,The deviants are organic,qn0q4y

hogzim8,Because some motha fuckas always tryin to ice skate uphill,qn0q4y
hk4j3ln,Is he not American?,qn0q4y
hsjzouv,Cause he sounded cool in the last films 🤷🏽‍♂️. Can’t disagree really. Would sound shite British.,qn0q4y
hjshswp,What happened in that?,qn0q4y
hjnlspd,He can’t control eternals,qn0q4y
hjoi10w,That’s what makes it funny but also I don’t think he can control his fellow Eternals. They’re all powerful and godlike and this dude picked up a rock and smacked her head with it lol.,qn0q4y
hjojpfz,She deserved it,qn0q4y
hjn7aon,"I’m not sure how to exactly phrase it, but did anybody else feel some significance between the last Deviant being killed (the creatures who preyed on humans and thus were in-universe the biggest hurdle for the human population exploding to the level capable of birthing a Celestial) happening at the same time as the conquest of the Aztecs by the colonizing and (as Druig put it) genocidal Spaniards?",qn0q4y
hjfts2w,"But we clearly saw that they interacted with Humans throughout their entire time on earth.

Pre splitting up, they were living amongst them. Dancing, hunting, etc.

Post split, they each fully integrated themselves into society in different parts of the world.

IIRC, Wen Wu and the 10 Rings had been around for a thousand years at least. And their 'organization' spanned the entire globe. 

I'm not saying for sure they interacted or had conflicts. But I definitely think they would have been aware of him and the rings",qn0q4y
hjjy4qx,What was the Shang Chi credits scene then? Wasn't it supposed to tie into Eternals?,qn0q4y

hjpyacb,"It would be a cool connection. Make it so Eternals have tried this plan before but failed, and the rings are just the remnants. It could explain how it ""activated"" in the closing scenes of Shang-Chi.",qn0q4y
hk1b3vj,"I knew it wasn't because of the timeline, but it was like, ""Dude, you're just making the Ten Rings.""",qn0q4y
hjif5g8,Same,qn0q4y
hk03t8w,"There was an illustration during the credits that looked like multiple rings around a humanoid forearm. I looked up for a moment just before it went off screen, but I wonder if that could be tied to Phastos dabbling with meddling in humanity's tech.",qn0q4y
hk9o530,im still convinced he created the rings,qn0q4y
hjn94eq,">Phastos
 
Wait is that really how you spell his name?",qn0q4y
hsg5sr4,"wong’s there in the sanctum going “damn it, more rings??”",qn0q4y
hji16ga,"Me too. I was waiting for a oh shit, whered I put those rings moment hahaha. That would have been a good end credit scene. It totally looks like his tech. Or some sort of celestial tech. If another one lost it on earth or left it there on purpose...",qn0q4y
hjf177u,"You might be onto something, the first post credits scene for Shang-Chi was about them trying to identify the origin of the rings.",qn0q4y
hjjhcga,The rings are from a ancient race of shape shifters. Look up fin fang foom and the ten rings.,qn0q4y
hjmbypl,I'm almost poaitive they were in the end credits.,qn0q4y
hjk41i8,"No it wasn’t, it was referencing fin fang foom",qn0q4y
hjh6zbr,"Also the Skrulls. Secret Invasion will reveal that they too have been hiding among humans for centuries or millennia or something, mark my words.",qn0q4y
hk0wi02,"AIM is in there from Iron Man 3, and if you count Agents of Shield, you have like 5 different splinter organizations like Centipede and the Watchdogs",qn0q4y
hjjhz14,The ten rings aren’t human. They come from an alien race and the beacon is most likely sending the signal to fin fang foom or someone of the Makluans race. But I believe it’s fin fang foom.,qn0q4y
hjhljy0,"They weren't supposed to, but they did. Look back to the scene with Phastos after the Hiroshima bomb. He blamed himself for interfering and giving them so much technology.",qn0q4y
hjglfxu,this annoyed me too,qn0q4y
hjh72kh,Very unpopular opinion but that already happened with the TVA and He Who Remains in Loki.,qn0q4y

hjdvtnz,"When she killed the sentient deviant, I felt nothing. Just... ""okay, but show me more of Ikaris' internal conflict""",qn0q4y
hjq91g6,"The deviants plot should have ended when Ikarus reveals himself. Maybe the sentient deviant is the one who reveals the truth to Cersie. As he is finishing up, Ikarus kills him, the. It flashes back to the betrayal. Honestly, the best parts of the movie were the slow parts focus mostly on the externals development.",qn0q4y

Huh???",qn0q4y
hjvyjkj,"Yea, I wanted more and partially/fully fixing her memories and having some flashbacks would have made it a bit more meaningful.",qn0q4y
hk8xqt5,It was a nerf,qn0q4y
hjdxz19,I think the Deviants “evolving” was there to show how the eternals could do so too,qn0q4y
hjx9djh,Honestly I thought the last deviant was the biggest missed opportunity. When they mentioned that the deviants were just like the eternals and just wanted to survive I thought they'd elaborate on it. Maybe even have Thena spare the deviant and allow him to join them. But nah he kind of just dies unceremoniously.,qn0q4y
hjent1u,"They could have just been there to make sure humans didn't destroy themselves. ""Caretakers of sentient life"" that aren't supposed to openly interfere is interesting especially when they find out they are actually just cultivating sacrifices.

Deviants didn't need to exist at all, especially if they changed their mind at the end and made Thanos a deviant eternal.",qn0q4y
hjdzvdw,"Well not nothing. For me the movie was about a family that struggles with the priority of the mission vs compassion for the people in front of you and loyalty towards your family. What the deviants added to the mix was that both of them was just flawed pawnes in another’s game and what the eternals did to them was horrific. 

In order for that to come across very clearly they needed a sentient deviant. 

I think this movie is so underrated. It’s all about the people struggling with choices and loyalty to the extent that one of them could’ve t even live with what he’d done despite believing in he’s choices. 

Basically all of them made different choices which highlights that it isn’t black and white and all of us reacts differently. All the way from staying true to your purpose to staying true to your family and inbetween where you just walk away.",qn0q4y
hk6hw9z,"You can 100% cut out deviants. Just say they were there to kindle civilization. Instead of the Eternals saving children and villagers from deviants in Mesopotamia, it could've been from a pack of prehistoric animals and the effect is the same. From there, they just protect humanity and steer clear. Then when the celestial awakens, the plot can happen.",qn0q4y
hji4dgr,"They already didn’t know their ultimate mission for being there. They were just as in the dark at present day. The Deviants didn’t really provide them (or us, the audience) a good reason for being there and not leaving.",qn0q4y
hjo70to,"It's a nod to the comic and fan service to people who know the eternals stories.

That 'prime' deviant was Kro and marries and has kids with  Thena in the comics.",qn0q4y
hk4vcol,"Agree. Could have gone the way of Watchmen and been a character driven drama disputing the morality of saving millions of lives vs not allowing billions of lives to come into being. Hell, that's something that it would be worth having Zhao on board to deliver, too.

But that wouldn't satisfy the mainstream audiences that Marvel sell to. They need their horde punching bags to all the meaningless fighty zoomies.

This was such a missed opportunity to actually embrace the cosmic scale of the Eternals.",qn0q4y
hjm6q1t,"Here comes dat deviant!

Oh shit waddup!",qn0q4y
hjnhyqi,"It wouldn't have made sense from the deviants' perspective: the Eternals have been their lifelong enemy, to the point that not even the destruction of the planet matters enough to warrant teaming up. They just really, really want revenge against the ones who've been trying to genocide them.",qn0q4y
hjo62ds,"He was hunting them throughout the film, so it would have been nice if he'd been a little bit more menacing throughout the film. You know, like destroying the places that they'd been to keep them on the run. It would also be interesting if he could corrupt humans or animals, turning them into Deviants.",qn0q4y

ikzvesr,That was him?????? Wow!,qn0q4y
hkf8b5e,That’s kinda why I wish the Eternals was just it’s own thing and not part of the MCU. These dudes are just too OP lmao. Like why would Dr Strange not show up at any point during this? He’d portal over and be like “who the hell are you guys and why is their a Titan coming out of the water?” Then he would handle it. I think Marvel is hitting a point of too many cooks in the kitchen.

 When aliens attack New York the normal people in the MCU were shown they were not alone in the universe. When Thanos snapped they were shown unquestionably how woefully outmatched and powerless we are to otherworldly entities who are functionally god like beings.

hsjv2ik,"Uh, what? You don’t need an American accent to act well.",qn0q4y
hjp3jwc,"These are just my opinions and they might be unpopular. Also, the experience of watching the film is different from what's on paper, so some plot points sound good, but the execution can be weak.

The biggest one is probably the Eternals learning they are synthetic robots of some kind who get amnesia and their home planet Olympia doesn't exist at all. I like the sequence because of the visuals, but it's not unexpected to us since the Eternals are set up as different from Asgardians and other aliens in the MCU. We've never see the ""lie"" of Olympia. The Eternals don't even know what they're missing, because they don't remember it and it doesn't exist. Sersi learns of this and doesn't really act different. For a main character, it's hard to identify with her struggle and what we learn with her. We've had gentle protagonists who don't emote except in times of extreme duress, but we don't get close to Sersi. 

She goes through a normal kind of arc where she learns of untapped power that were within her and she ends up controlling it to save the day. She turns the deviant into a tree, and they have the conversation that she doesn't know how she did that, and by then we're in the climax of the movie because Tiamut is waking up. We don't get that conflict of her learning new powers, her new role as a leader, and stepping up to interfere on Earth after thousands of years of observing, except when deviants are involved. She doesn't feel involved in the family drama parts of the story. We've had great family dramas that are focused on families after the death of someone. August: Osage County is one of them. We see how dysfunctional the family is, the secrets they keep, the slow build up of what they can and can't admit to each other before all is revealed. Sersi should feel more active in everything.

The entire film is talking about Tiamut because the celestial is the real threat, which makes the deviant parts so weak. Even though Kro poses a real threat, he feels disjointed from what the characters are mainly dealing with. The family is talking about their relationship with society, with the universe, and what they're going to do, but we have deviants running around as a distraction planned by Ikaris. When Ikaris reveals himself as the orchestrator of the attacks, it doesn't mean as much as it should. Maybe because Ikaris doesn't actually control the deviants. Kro acts as an independent organism gaining consciousness. When Kro interrupts the fighting in the climax, he feels superfluous. When Kro is defeated, there isn't a real sense of victory or any cathartic feeling because the main conflict is still going on.

The resolution with Sersi and Ikaris happened quickly. He can't fight her so he joins in the uni-mind and then he flies into the sun. The movie moves on to a light hearted get together with Phastos's family. Much more could have been done with Ikaris's sense of duty, the betrayal to his family and to Arashim, his love or hatred of humans and Earth and so on.

Basically, there's a lot of elements in the movie since it's dealing with non-human characters who can live (presumably) forever, the creation and end of Earth, celestial and deviant beings, flashbacks throughout civilization, family and relationship conflict, individual conflict with Phastos, Ikaris, Thena, and Sprite, and we're aware that this fits into the MCU and dealing with all that lore. Not all of it adds up to something great because of our identification with the lead(s) and the type of conflict the antagonists bring.",qn0q4y

Also im kinda disappointed they didnt go into shang chis rings after credit scene. I think its obvious theyre eternal made. Obviously I could be wrong but I think this is how they tie all the movies together to fight the celestials...

It's possible that off screen they tried but got completely stomped. So we know they have the power to destroy & create suns & stars. They're about as big as planets.

Infinity Ultron could with a single thought, destroy a galaxy. He punched the watcher, a multiversal entity through the multiverse and beat his ass.

For reference to the comics, Thanos with the Infinity Gauntlet casually flicked away the celestials and imprisoned beings of far higher power.

The Celestials are hopelessly outclassed here. They are tough enough on their own but they're not putting up a fight against the Infinity Gauntlet. 

The most likely scenario is that maybe Arishem and all the other celestials banded together to stop him only to get thought out of existence.",qn0q4y

hjj7thl,"Exactly. FATWS had a little too much filler, and Eternals could have used more character development.

hjiu1xn,"That’s actually one of the first things that I noticed in the movie! Maybe about a minute or so into the first fight scene I realized “hey this guy isn’t Marvel Superman, he’s Marvel Homelander.” There are a lot of things going into it, but I think it’s super obvious when you look at the way they fight. They both rely almost entirely on eyebeams to the exclusion of all else, and don’t actually physically move their bodies all that much. Just angry eyebeams for days.

Superman in the other hand is mainly a physical fighter. His main method of attack is getting up close to something and punching it with his superstrength, and he very rarely uses his heat vision to attack, and practically never as a primary means of doing damage.",qn0q4y

hje2za2,"I don't see why not. It seems like the general consensus is that the critic reception was overblown, most of the audience are saying it was actually pretty good (86% on RT right now), but even if you don't agree with that, ""worst Marvel movie"" feels like a massive overreaction.

Also, the main complaints about the movie are basically out of the way now, too much exposition was an issue for some and that's not needed now that we know about the Eternals and their history, and introducing too many characters was an issue but now there are only 6 of the 10 Eternals left and we already know them.

At the end of the day, it depends on box office, but it's Marvel, that will likely be fine once people realize those critic reviews are just weirdly low.",qn0q4y

So actually, we got a lot more of her than originally intended.",qn0q4y
hjee9bb,Well to me it seems obvious they are setting her up for a big future. An important strong character that can't breakthrough due to personal barriers always gets a tasty redemption in the MCU,qn0q4y

hjgg1th,"She's had an interesting presence in culture, part of that being she kind of got too famous for her personal life, which isn't really a good thing for an actor. She's really good in Those Who Wish Me Dead which came out this spring, even if she for sure is physically miscast (I'm sorry, but there are no firefighters who look like Angelina Jolie)",qn0q4y
hjleun6,"I'm still surprised they didn't kill her off. Jolie seemed like the typical ""A-lister who hops on for only one film and the dips after cashing in the cheque"" casting, but nope seems like she's actually sticking around.

hjdxajp,Oh you didn’t like the abrupt sex scene in a movie for an audience including children? Weird bro. (/s),qn0q4y
hjua7yx,"Total with you there. The best sex scenes in movies give insight into character relationships; it’s two people at their most vulnerable so you see how the pair act in such an intimate environment.

hji24ts,"They at least try in the comics run, right?",qn0q4y
hjrse3o,"Would they have known about it, though?

Thanos was off planet until he arrived in Wakanda, and then spent 30 minutes fighting before getting the final stone and wiping out half of the universe. 

The Eternals wouldn't have even known he was there, let alone known what he had planned.",qn0q4y
hkqe8iq,"So I'm going to propose a theory, but I want to preface it that I'm trying to come up with a rational explanation for this obvious plot hole so that it doesn't continue to bug me going forward - so I'm undoubtedly approaching with a bias.

The Celestials are obscenely powerful.  Their role in the universe is one of creation - they create new planets, new life, etc.  That seems to be the sole extent of their desired involvement though.  They don't rule over planets.  They don't go on conquests.  They don't interfere with the day-to-day activities of their creation.  The only sentient life they seem to actively meddle with is the Deviants - and that's only because they created them for the purpose of aiding their creative works, and now they're opposing it.

Celestials create, and then they keep on trucking.   Generally speaking, they don't seem to care what sentient life in the universe does.  The Deviants seem to be the one exception, and that's because I think the Celestials simply view the Deviants as a tool, and so the normal rules of non-involvement don't apply to them - they were never meant to ""live"" like other sentient life.

That would explain why the Celestials don't ever intervene in the activities of sentient life in the universe, even if that activity may interfere with their creative works.  After all, what's the point of creating life with free will if you're not going to allow them to exercise it?  

The only problem I would have with this theory is that Thanos is an Eternal, so it seems like the same exception to the ""non-interference"" rule that applies to the Deviants would apply to him.  Although now that I'm thinking about it, the MCU has never established that Thanos is an Eternal - it's strictly in the comics at this point.  And given that they've adjusted their origin story for Eternals in the MCU, it stands to reason that Thanos' origins may be different as well.",qn0q4y
hjqlq1v,How long was Dormammu even going about his business until Strange rewound time? Didn't seem long enough for the Eternals to have even noticed.,qn0q4y
hjg1gft,"> And also consider, it happens in Wakanda, the secret African country that very few people know the location of.

Imagine thinking the Eternals don't know about Wakanda.",qn0q4y
hjg2g5p,"I was thinking the same. Most of them couldn't do much anyone.

Druig could possible mind control the army. Speeder could do speedster things.

The rest, I dont think would of had much of an impact.

Ikaris, gilgamesh and thena are all types of people already in the movie, just weaker. Ikaris weather than Captain Marvel, Weaker than Thor. Gilgamesh weaker than hulk. Thena..just another melee fighter. They wouldn't of made any difference.

Sprite pointless, the creator guy pointless Sersei point.ess. Like..none of them could really do anything to with Thanos anyone except the first two lisited.

That being said, the excuse is still bad, because it goes directly against their logic. They are trying to INCREASE population for the emergence, ..and here they are just letting half of it disappear, more than any deviant would of ever done....",qn0q4y
hjun5cd,"Halfing the world population would put us to the same population level as 1972.  It sets them back less than 50 years, which is nothing to them.",qn0q4y

hjto5ig,Same. The worst was when Ma Dong-seok dropped his pie in grief and I thought it was supposed to be funny. 🥴,qn0q4y
hjmpl0o,"Nah Sersi definitely had a bigger bond.

hjmzgmh,"He worked with a lot of humans recently ( in the last 100 years or so ) , but until then he wasn’t very close to humanity at all. In the both flash back we don’t really see him interacting with humans.",qn0q4y
hjga6oq,And then you go to the Far From Home trailer and you ask “uhh WHY is strange helping Peter here?” Lol,qn0q4y
hjr03ss,That's what I thought would happen when they introduced Strange: He would rarely be acknowledged because he has the power to resolve 9 out of 10 plots in any movie.,qn0q4y
hk2vx7p,My guess is that he's not around.. No way home trailer kinda shows that it's not really Strange or something is up with him.,qn0q4y
hsgxnw0,"What? Wandavision is the only one I could see him fitting in and they actually were planning to have him show up but cut that idea.

Why would he show up in Falcon/WS, Black Widow, Loki, or Hawkeye? Shang Chi *maybe* but most of the third act was in a secret city.",qn0q4y
hjetufo,Chances are that Strange already knows the outcomes of the events too. No need to help if he knows the Eternals got it handled.,qn0q4y
hjl3uv3,"…or he is just very busy, which is also something that happens in the comics.

Sometimes he just jumps from one job to another - upstart wizard on Earth could sometimes lead to an abomination in another dimension.

I mean…he is ultimately just a man, not a god.",qn0q4y
hjfgblt,But he instantly knew when Thor and Loki popped down to Earth for a visit.,qn0q4y
hjlct3w,Yea he had betrayed both Sersi and Arishem at that point.,qn0q4y
hjs7okx,"But he only chooses to die that way, flying into the sun is because he is icarus. Too on the nose that.",qn0q4y
hjg5lj2,"LOL imagine thinking this fight had any weight. 

""Oh no, I wonder if Ikaris is going to win and the new Celestial is going to destroy the world.""",qn0q4y
hjf5ye5,"They should have explained ikarus's suicide more, but I think it lines up with his character in the movie. He's the most emotionally stunted of the eternals. He just wants to follow orders and not take any responsibility like a good soldier/robot. He's also the only eternal that doesn't adapt to human life in anyway and doesn't think for himself.

He leaves Cersi because he doesn't want to deal with knowing the secret, so running away was easier to him.

He kills ajak because he assumes he'll forget all about it later but when he realizes that he actually has to live with his actions he couldn't handle it.",qn0q4y
hjeaef3,"I mean, Strange knew the second Thor brought Loki to earth at the start of Ragnarok. I assume he would have some kind of spell that alerts him to a cosmic being growing out of the ground and destroying the planet or at least alert him to cosmic alien dogs killing people",qn0q4y

I mean it's good considering the amount of material they juggle but it's objectively bad.",qn0q4y
hjdzt5n,That was my feeling. It felt like I binge watched a mini series where I couldn't quite pinpoint where the episodes ended.,qn0q4y
hjihd3v,I think the biggest flaw was the script. The dialogue was generic and purely functional.,qn0q4y
hjn69ww,"To me, it honestly felt quicker than Shang Chi and that was like a half hour shorter",qn0q4y
hjjbxe1,"Comparing this to Dune is so accurate. Both had great looking scenes, underdeveloped characters, cool fight scenes, and boring parts sparsed here and there.",qn0q4y
hjdsagj,"I disagree because my favorite part was the characters. Not so much Hayek or Jolie but the main players and their interactions was by far the best part.  

Problem is it's a superhero movie so they need to add Deviants so we can get big fight scenes. If it were just about the core group of Eternals having to weight the option of saving earth or fulfilling their purpose, it would have been a far more interesting film but i bet most audience would hate it",qn0q4y
hjyb5cp,"Salma Hayek was absolutely terrible in this movie. Horrible, horrible acting.",qn0q4y
hjdgyd4,"I somewhat disagree, with such big names I really wasn't sure who was going to live and die. Because you can make an arguement that ""Oh the actor who has no street cred in america, he will die"" or ""this actor/actress is to big of a star to keep around, so they have to die"" and felt like the only person that was safe was Sersi from the start",qn0q4y
hjy6jtt,Mph! Cold. I love this comment.,qn0q4y
hspl2ah,"Makarri's speedster fight with Ikaris towards the end is one of my favorite speedster portrayals of all time.  It really showed off the true potential of a speedster versus a Superman type hero.  Skip to about 1:58 to see that.  I also adored the couple of Arishem scenes.  Celestials had a very real possibility of just looking dumb or silly but he felt downright terrifying.  Specifically, the scene very nearly at the end of the movie with Arishem holding Sersi above earth was just perfection.",qn0q4y
hje2a1s,In your opinion,qn0q4y
hjhihw4,If Phase 4 is gonna be getting more cosmic like this I dunno if it is gonna do so hot.,qn0q4y
hjlbt7h,"Heh, yeah I guess that goes to show how varied opinions can be on these movies.  I tend to appreciate TDW more than most tbh, it has a lot of fantastic character building scenes for both Thor and Loki.  The scene where Loki reveals the real state of his prison, for example, is one of my favorite moments in all of the early movies.  TDW is just unfortunately brought down *a lot* by a boring villain and weird lore.

Does it make total sense? Not really.

But this sort of thing happens in the comics all the time. You simply cant have other superheroes showing up all the time in other comic books solving their problems.

Why, you may ask?

Because it would take away from the tension of reading the current book if all it took was Thor to show up and solve a problem.

This is sort of where you have to have a suspension of disbelief.

This is the problem with relying too heavily on a superhero universe imo. The comics basically handled this by only crossing over occasionally.

I mean I get it, but it feels like something we want in theory more than we'd like in the finished product.

If say, Captain Marvel showed up to handle things, her screentime would take away from other characters in their own movie. 

This actually happened in Captain America: Civil War, where Cap himself had to fight for screentime in his own film. To the point where his kiss with Sharon felt tacked on because their relationship wasn't developed.

His relationship with his girlfriend wasn't fully developed in his own movie.  

That's kind of a problem.

With the Alaska plug I was already looking forward to him being a bad for Wolverine to throw himself against and get clowned on or something. 

This guy could’ve been the last second other half of the Uni-mind, representing the unwilling half of the eternal’s power after eating Ikarus and giving Deviants a spot at the table in the destruction of a celestial. A kind of proof that the evolution process is something that bears fruit and not fuel. 

You could then have the Ikarus personality take over and fling itself into the sun at either the same point or another in the future maybe and it wouldn’t be bad supoku theatre.

. The idea of them considering themselves different than humans, but sprite has a conflict with her childish looks, when it shouldn't be a problem, since they are not human. They are robots that get their minds wiped everytime. There should be no issues with Ikarus and Sprite being together.  
. Sprites betrayal when no love for Ikarus is shown. I honestly thought Sprite was the smartest and she was following Ikarus to control him in secret.  
. Ajak doesn't get enough character development for us to care about her death. And the movie goes around the character telling the other characters that she is dead.  
. The main conflict about the birth of the celestial is told at the end of the movie. So it gives a sense of rushing everything.  
. The  inclusive character and cast dilema. Let's have: 1 asian male, 1 asian female 1 latino, 1 afro descendant, 1 white adult, 1 white kid, 1 white girl with conflict about her appearence, 1 stereotypical american blonde female, 1 heterosexual relationship, 1 homosexual relationship, White Males are evil (Ikarus, and Druig believing itself to be superior to others), Female characters are ordinarily good. Non white male characters have supporting roles as the good guys but under the shadow of females. I am not saying their shouldn't be female main characters, I am just pointing out, how it looks. It looks like they are pushing an inclusive agenda. And it's a movie.   
. Wardrove is bad. Thena's blonde hair, bright white costume, and flashy golden powers should be the description of a main character. She highlights way more that Sersei.  
. Ikarus's ""It was a deviant"" on Ajak's death, when he just arrived on the scene and litterally no one asked. It's like saying ""It was me"".

In contrast, Awkwafina did fairly well with her role in Shang-Chi. 

So comedy actors can do well given the context. They just really gave nothing for Kumali to do beyond be funny. It wasn't really his fault. I wish they gave him the script that justified his insane workout regimen for this movie.

Seriously, the amount of stuff he did to prep for this role should have been anchored to a better character.",qn0q4y
hjfc3cy,"Oh yeah.

Some of the humor was fine.

But so much of it was the same old MCU style of interrupting a dramatic moment to tell a joke.

This is a 2.5 hour movie. It's bound to have *some* humor that actually works, but so much of it was dealt with in a way that kept deflating the tension. 

Did we really need to see Sersi's phone go off during the middle of a really important conversation? It's not like it added to the plot. It was done to be ironic.

These movies have got to stop doing stuff like that. I mean I get how the common teenager would chuckle at it, but that's just it.

It's teenage style humor.

Using gag humor to deflect from the serious moments that need to be dealt with. 

I'm not opposed to humor. You *need* humor.

However, imagine having Mufasa's death and then immediately following it with Scar saying ""Well that was dramatic.""

Sure, it may cause some teenagers to snicker with laughs. But it did so at the cost of deflating tension with meta style ""arent we so silly"" humor.

By having a line like that, you immediately take away the tension of that moment, and it creates a weird space where you can't really take it fully seriously.

Eternals had many moments like that, and I'm like ""Fucking Marvel, just stop doing this...""

It's 'empty calorie' sort of humor. It elicits awkward chuckles, sure, but it doesn't allow the movie to stick with you.",qn0q4y

The actor hard arguably the most on-screen chemistry between characters with Makkari and pretty much walked a fine line between compassion and authoritarianism consistently. Dude has the ability to save people and stop a genocide and can’t because of rules. And you can tell the conflict there. And honestly him using mind control on like 20 people to shoot the deviant was super creative visually and a great set piece.

The best example was Sprite's love for Ikarus. It just hits you without any sort of indication when Druig suddenly tells Sprite that he knows about her feelings for Ikarus.

With all of that I see some possibility there. But also, I don’t think it’s Nick Fury because the voice sounded a bit off to be Samuel L. Jackson.

Atleast the others had each other or someone special they can cobfide in and deal with the fact. Icaris dealt with it all by himself for over 2000 years.

I'm sure Marvel will still have good movies, but it does feel like a lot of the charm is going away. I suppose there's only so many times you can make similar movies before it's dull, but it seems their early films did a good job building up characters and making you care about them. Now not so much.

Thought Eternals was awful and it really felt like a DC movie (sorry DC fans I too am one but most of the DCEU has been hot garbage) in the worst ways.

It felt completely unnecessary to have these two paired up when the film would’ve been completely fine without the whole “I love this human man but I haven’t seen my ex in 500 years…what do I do?” It really bogged the character of Sersi down which was totally awful. Sersi should’ve been more powerful and more on the side of discovering herself and becoming a true leader in the shadow of Ajax’s death, not constantly looking over her shoulder to her ex-lover Ikaris.

The problem I have with this is that there was hundreds of years he had to tell her but then didn't and in the end he couldn't kill her. So why leave it to assume that Sersi would have never understood?

To rephrase we see Sersi fall in love with Ikaris and marry. We also in the same part of the movie see a relationship with Dane (Kit) that felt non-existent. For example Sersi did not want to move in. We can or I can conclude at that point through the flashbacks that Sersi was still in love with Ikaris and was waiting for him to return and re-connect.

This happens but Ikaris is carried away by a Deviant and then turns on all the Eternals before realizing that he loves Sersi and throwing himself into the Sun.

Then we see Dane (Kit) show back up and confess his love for Sersi.

When they fought outside, he only threw thena once, and she was caught by Makkari, but she landed two strikes on him, he never landed a single blow on Phastos.

No deviants, no interference.

My point is that, post split up, Ajak told them to go live their own destinies. They already “completed their mission” as Eternals. 

And maybe that’s why I like this movie so much. It tells a story about 10 literal robot gods who can influence the world and humans so much. Yet, they don’t because they each have their own ideas / lives to live.",qn0q4y

Yes, when deviants were involved. Sometimes pretty directly and sometimes indirectly but each time the common denominator was the deviants were around.

hjtvtt5,"Big props to that relationship too, as it was crafted super well for the character development and growth of his character of the course of the film in present day and over the millennia.

I think it was hard to achieve with where/how they establish Sersi at the beginning of the film. It’s cemented she’s dating Dane Whitman and we’re led to believe she only doesn’t want to move in due to, well, the whole she’s an immortal space demigod living with her “sister” who has and always will look like a child. Then we get the establishment of everything with Ikaris and in the back of our minds we remember “well, he randomly leaves her in the future at some point (also idk if why is ever explained in the movie?)” so the entirety of the flashbacks we’re focused on when they fall out, but we never see that. Meanwhile in present day she’s keeping up with Dane on video calls *from the Amazon* while trying to *hunt Deviants* with this thousand-years-relationship ex, so obviously she’s pretty into Dane.

So to try to tie that all up in a bow: all of the close relationships (whether romantic or not, since idk if I’d venture as far as to say the last two on this list are certainly 100% romantic) we see in the movie are the only ones we see for those characters - Phastos/his husband, Gilgamesh/Thena, Druig/Makkari. There isn’t another suitor for any of them. Then we have a love triangle for Sersi that involves a guy she’s dated for presumably a few years vs a guy she married *centuries* ago and has been with for *millennia* who relatively super recently left her, and her leaning towards the former without really emoting much with the latter present day. The scale makes it hard to understand and I feel the writers could’ve done a better job with it (although it’s possible it was lost in one of the 3 credited rewrites…)",qn0q4y

hjrt7r5,Did you even watch the movie lol. It’s not just for Ikaris. She can’t experience a normal life like the rest of the group and she is bitter and envious because of that. Living on this planet and stopping the new celestial means an eternity of living a life she doesn’t like and feels trapped by. At least if they spawn a celestial her memory can be wiped and they can start on a new planet altogether again.

The Thanatos drive, the death drive, is far more anal retentive control freak where you are trying to control the chaos and uncertainty life produces and thus is tied to as aggression, repetition, compulsion, and self-destructiveness.  With the Thanatos drive we humans may choose stupid options but we may do so for we feel in control, it is familiar, and we survived it before we even if pain occurs.

There, he located Sui-San, and together they used technology to found a new species of Eternal-derived beings, the Titans. They developed Titan into a wonder of science, building the supercomputer ISAAC to help them run the environment. As they flourished, some Eternals of Earth started believing that the Zurasian faction had been overly conservative. Little did they know that Sui-San had just given birth to Thanos, who would one day become one of the Universe's greatest menaces.",qn0q4y

hsjsx8p,Then what is the whole 'Prince of Titan/brother of Thanos'' connection?,qn0q4y
huomnt9,"same. I did the exact same thing; from basically his first apperance it was super obvious that it was going to be him. Wish they could have just revealed his perspective from the first, and built the movie around the group trying to choose sides, etc",qn0q4y

hobyi67,You kidding? DC has way more exciting fight scenes.,qn0q4y
hjrthbh,Paperboy’s character is Batman and we get Batman Superman right as well as flash v Superman. It’s the movie justice league wanted to be but with actually compelling storyline and good characters/production. Just goes to show how much dc shits the bed,qn0q4y
hkakgla,This movie wasn’t complex by a stretch but summing him up as evil Superman is a lazy take.,qn0q4y
hjvwk61,He dealt with his inner turmoil like javert too. As he was about to kill himself I was thinking of javert the entire time.,qn0q4y
hjruqhn,"He wasn't directly partaking it the murder. He was standing by as gods were doing the murder. 

Either way, I thought his rationale was perfectly compelling",qn0q4y
hjm100r,But killing trillions of would be species across the universe with hopes and dreams similar to earth’s humanity is?,qn0q4y
hjrxth2,"It's definitely also because of the popularity of Batman, who became known for his darker and edgier comics, like The Dark Knight Returns, as well as his runs that focused on how maladjusted he was as a result of his parents' murder. So DC kinda tried to replicate that starting with the Death of Superman arc, as well as the New 52 reboot version of Superman (who was a lot angrier and more rebellious), as well as the way his character was portrayed in the DCEU.

I personally like the route they're currently taking him, focusing on his role as a father, and using that to emphasize the best and most hopeful aspects of his personality and connection to humanity. It changes up the formula, while still keeping the essence of what Superman is.",qn0q4y
hjq78zy,This is actually a really good point. I don’t think a lot of people realize this,qn0q4y
hkhqhbv,That and even show watchers should know that Nolan is not just “evil Superman” by the end of season 1.,qn0q4y

hjgnz89,"Yeah, I used to think Superman was very boring because he could win any fight. Now I have grown to really appreciate him as a character and always have to defend him when others are claiming he's lame.",qn0q4y
hjry2uh,"Actually, they've done a lot with Superman in the comics, and his best runs usually focus more on his internal conflicts and values than any physical fights he gets involved in. Right now, he's a father, and there's a lot of interesting stuff they're doing with his relationship with his son and the values he's trying to instill in him.

Also, there have been a number of recent runs involving a fight with evil version of the team. The Crime Syndicate of America from Earth-3 is this exact concept and they had a huge arc in the New 52 run of the Justice League. Ultraman is the original version of Omniman/Homelander.",qn0q4y

hjdx54l,"All Star Superman is a good read though, I'm guessing its easier to write evil Superman nowadays than good Superman...",qn0q4y
hjgkd22,"Which is why it sucks that the MCU just gained ~10 superpowered immortal good guys to help out with the next whatever.  

You even see it with No Way Home:  Spider-Man is going to have to fight Doctor Octopus again, but this time the one advantage Doctor Octopus has (four metal arms protruding from his back that respond to his thoughts), Spider-Man has as well thanks to his Iron Spider armor.  

So it's a regular man with four mechanical arms vs a super-strong super-fast early-warning-sensed stick-to-walls shoot-webbing man with four mechanical arms.

Fights were better when the good guy side was at a disadvantage.",qn0q4y

hjybsza,"You're in a thread about a movie in a franchise that was built on the back of a character like Captain America, who is literally all of those qualities that you just deemed ""implausible"" in today's world.

The lack of awareness is astounding.",qn0q4y
hjry9rb,Which ones? The one where he murders Zod and destroys a city by the end of the movie? The one where he fights a human and nearly kills him because he dislikes his methods of dispatching crime? Or the one where he's resurrected and nearly kills the rest of his teammates?,qn0q4y

hjuknho,Except they didn’t stop him. He got to Sersi and decided at the end not to stop her,qn0q4y
hjv9vh8,"I don't really see why that would be necessary. Thanos' power level relative to other MCU characters matters in IW because he is interacting with them in that movie. None of the Eternals interact with existing Marvel characters so their strength isn't relevant outside of ""who would win"" fan arguments. Killing off a minor character would not have really raised the stakes more than >!killing Gilgamesh!< already did.",qn0q4y
hk0k7is,"Those eye lasers were pretty weak in my eyes.

Also Thena was just short of terrible. Nowhere near as good a fighter as someone who inspired a Goddess of War should be, and why did she get Space PTSD for most of the film? It's not like she's an innately broken power that must be limited for the plot to work like the speedster.",qn0q4y
hsdcvpl,"For me personally all of the Eternals felt like Mages from Chronicles of darkness, but with very specific specialities.",qn0q4y
hjlzccs,"I guess he just meant that because he had helped guide and advance humanity through technology, THAT was what they (and by extension, he himself) had achieved. Not global peace or the eradication of disease/hunger or anything like that, but instead just another way to kill each other by the thousands.    
    
As far as the framing of the scene itself, since Deviants were long gone at that point and since the Eternals were still hardcore anti-interference, it wouldn’t have made much sense to have had him actively trying to stop the bombings. Which I would say makes it all the moar heartbreaking - that even though he and his fellow Eternals could have easily stopped those bombs with absolutely no effort, they were so loyal to their instructions and to their directive that all they could do was just watch.",qn0q4y

hk6qzk4,"I disagree, they should have gotten a different actor. Aaron Johnson’s acting was so bad in that movie",qn0q4y

hjfd0id,I was just refering to the visual effects of making a human actor look fast.,qn0q4y
hje37ya,"Not sure yet. But the sword you saw is the Ebony Blade which is passed down through Dane’s family. It’s a cursed blade, so I think they’re using it to introduce Blade since he lives in the world of Vampires. So we may see more dark magic in the future.",qn0q4y

hjhrm0i,"Just curious - can you elaborate on why you categorized the script character-driven? 

I also liked the script a lot. Read super fun super fast, but to me, it was more plot-driven. By the way, personally the only criticism I had is it's too big of a cast, if they can find way to cut out the >!reporters (yep I understand they help drive the plot)!<, I think the script'd be leaner/more focused/better.

hjdtyjr,I thought she did a great job,qn0q4y
hje0thw,"Nah. by all means the Marvel team really enjoyed working with her and she enjoyed working with Marvel. She would absolutely come back if they were to make another Eternals film. Whether that happens sooner rather than later depends on the reception by fans, but given the reviews, it'll probably be years from now rather than something they immediately slate into the movie timeline (like they did for Spidey and an Ant-man sequel).",qn0q4y
hjpzra3,"I thought the direction was wonderful... my only gripe is the pacing, which can be fixed in editing, which apparently she was less hands-on with than she usually is.",qn0q4y
hjdyq10,I think they find her a passion project somewhere else in the massive company,qn0q4y
hje2j0z,The shot of Arishem at the very end was truly awesome. This movie broke some cool potential I thought which is impressive from a director who had never done a film like this before.,qn0q4y
hjg9scu,"I don’t think that’s the general consensus at all, opening weekend (and specifically opening night, where your data is coming from) is made up largely of MCU fans. 

It’s way too soon to tell what the general audience thinks, we won’t really know until next weekend when we can see the box office drops.",qn0q4y
hjmvk0m,"I agree with the main two criticisms, but I agree that there's a reason to be optimistic about what a Future Eternals movie from Zhao would look like, since those criticisms should be out of the way. I do not believe, however, that the critic reception was overblown. Those flaws were huge for this movie, and ultimately they dragged it down to being one of the weaker marvel films.


For me the biggest problem is the format of the story. I just think it would have worked better as a series. I'm still very excited for what the future holds for these characters, and as I was watching the movie I thought, ""I'd love to see them in TV series""",qn0q4y
hje3ql7,"Marvel does change directors all the time tho,Capt. Marvel and Dr Strange was a huge hit and better reviews but they changed directors,low rated Marbel movies like Thor 2 and Ironman 2 changed directors as well.",qn0q4y

hjrqkox,">most of the audience are saying it was actually pretty good (86% on RT right now),

That's the same rating as Rise of Skywalker, a universally hated movie. And its cinemascore is a B. The movie has a pretty terrible reception outside of fanboys on reddit.",qn0q4y
hjmcv0c,"It’s the “worst Marvel movie” in that it’s just NOT a Marvel movie in the format everyone is used to, I feel. 

I don’t get why critics are panning it when they’ve been saying Marvel need to change it up for ages now. This IS Marvel changing it up and I loved it",qn0q4y

hjn9h63,"It felt really out of place, but I have a theory.

They wanted to include the same-sex kiss. Foreseeing that people would say they found it to be ""too much"", they included a hetero sex scene to expose hypocrisy.",qn0q4y
hjtgcbr,Yeah it was the first time. So jarring to me because of how many younger kids were in my theatre. I feel bad for the mom that took her son and friends and had no idea probably wishing she had 10 hands to cover all the eyes...,qn0q4y

hjlhvy1,"When the movie finished, I turned to my friend next to me and says, ""she lived!"" because I really thought she was going to die. I know it's not her doing any of the stunt work but Thena's got moves and like I said earlier, she's got presence and delivered what Thena is going through. 

I really hope there's a future movie greenlit with Thena. And now that we know about the 'mad weary' and the info about their past memories, she has the potential to be a part of a pivotal storyline with the undertone of will she betray them or will she survive and how is she going to cope with the loss of her best friend and caretaker",qn0q4y
hjgmoro,"For me it was just ultimately really pointless. There was nothing about it that added to the plot, it wasn't even used in the flashback montage of them being in love.

hje0fe2,Pretty vanilla sex scene if you ask me,qn0q4y

Also why other Eternals like Starfox ( dude from credit scene ) and Thanos ( if confirmed an Eternal) seemed to be free of any ordeal like the one those stationed on Earth have ?

And thus energy like that would probably go under the radar since it had seemingly always been there. And i don't really see how he'd detect the Deviants? They had also been there for years, frozen in the ice caps. They became public after the London incident but i don't see how Strange would be able to track them down from just that.",qn0q4y

If all it took was interconnectivity to make a good franchise, the DCEU would have succeeded a long time ago.

What’s unique about Captain Marvel was Carol’s discovery and realization that she doesn’t need to be who she was told to be but who she is instead, and that is good enough. She learnt and found the confidence to be her own person.

I think the 2nd act of both films were about the coming back together of a family may be the vibe you’re thinking of?

I like Captain Marvel alright. They did a pretty good job portraying her internal conflicts, but her external conflicts where she battled her former teammates and Ronan were kinda boring. Maybe it’s because her teammates were extremely undeveloped.

hjhoezz,"I disagree with this completely. I feel like the quips they used in Eternals in these ""dramatic moments"" were well timed and frankly needed. They cut up the boring cliche character monologues that otherwise would've made the movie dull and some of the characters far more irritating to watch for 2.5 hours.

The ringtone gag as you mentioned, I think it quite nicely cut through Druics sad boy woe-is-me rant about how his whole life was a lie, and needs time to think... In front of 4 other characters who just had the same revelation.

Sprite getting knocked out was also well timed. A celestial is about to destroy Earth, Sprite has stabbed her best friend and decides this is the perfect moment for a selfish monologue about how much the humans have hurt her feelings by simply existing. It was a really pathetic character moment for her, and I'm glad they cut it short with the quip. I wish they'd just scrapped the monologue entirely and done something else to get this struggle across.

The real dramatic moments weren't undercut at all. Marvel have learnt over the years when is good and when is bad to add these jokes in, but some viewers just see the jokes and immediately eye roll, assuming it must have just ruined a perfect moment because that's what used to happen. But I think they've got it down perfectly in this movie. The moments they ""undercut"" were never going to be dramatic.",qn0q4y

As the other 9 characters were already doing? 

He was the only one with a unique route. We didn't need him added to the fight, it wouldn't of added anything to it and it wouldn't of made him a better character.

>have him pick his friends and humanity over the celestial and figh

Which friends? Thats my point. He didn't want to fight either side, because both sides he considered family/friends. It wasn't just choosing Eternals vs Celestials like Ikarus choice was. It was fight eternals or fight eternals. He wasn't doing it.

>it’s boring and uninteresting and makes his character use less to the over all plot.

As opposed to having him do the same thing every other character was already doing. How is that more interesting or more useful to the plot to just add more characters doing the same thing? This makes him a MORE complex character than most of the others just in that aspect alone.

I agree that the multiverse aspect of Marvel will be confusing and probably will turn some new viewers away who never seen Marvel. But they already lay the foundation to go into the multiverse. They got 10+ years of content and characters build up.

I wish ajak said something more along the lines of “blind faith is still blind” instead of leading him down the wrong path.

I enjoyed the time jumps. They mostly made sense in serving a certain theme that was just touched on. Plus their past was a big interest of mind so I liked witnessing it. I never felt lost or confused and was engaged. It felt like watching some A24 indie vibes swallow up the mcu formula. It asked questions and didn’t give us answers, which felt refreshing. 

Don’t get me wrong, it wasn’t perfect. It was pretty long and did have a drag in the middle portion. The deviants were either under used or unnecessary.

I don’t get the feeling that Sersi was somehow waiting on Ikaris at all. In fact just the opposite , I feel that she had moved on from him the first moment Ikaris showed up in London.

I feel that the theme of the movie supports this reading too. The movie asked each of the 10 Eternals what they would do for their loved ones. For Sersi we get what she would do for the humanity that she loves ( with Dane as a stand in ). It never asked what she would do for Ikaris.",qn0q4y

For mid-action scene, have another horde, or a special unit of fighters(STRIKE Team, Extremis Soldiers, Zealots) who can be defeated with a lot of effort, but the team will be led by a Captain, or Captains(Brock Rumlow, Eric Savin, Lucian Aster) who would defeat the Hero or at least, give them a difficult time.

Final battle/s, no hordes needed especially for the hero/es. A final battle should be a Boss Battle. Sometimes before a Boss Battle, there's a Mini Boss, the Captains. That makes the stakes far much important. Maybe instead of a Horde, have the Special Unit fight the hero/es allies, or, after some character growth, the hero will fair better against them.

* The universe is overcrowded and there is not enough resources
* Thanos snaps
* Half of the universe disappears. Thanos destroys the infinity stones
* Avengers go back in time and bring the stones back
* **Avengers lose here instead of win**
* Thanos gets the stones. He snaps again and intends to **""shred this universe down to it's last atom""**
* Not sure if the living Primordials might die, but certainly all the Primordials waiting to be born will die.

I don't know the power levels between Primordials and a fully stoned Thanos, but he was clearly a threat to the Primordial's goals of birthing more Primordials by feeding them living things.

At this point, I think Thanos would abandon his garden and keep the stones and play god for a while, probably just as timeless as the Primordials. 

They even said in the movie - War is good because it advances tech, then medical tech, then lifespans, then you get population growth. But some rogue titan bouncing around unaliving universes willy-nilly? They certainly can't be chill with that and just hope the Avengers take care of it.",qn0q4y

hjn4bux,"Yeah, I read one review before watching this and it complained about the characters not being developed. So I ended up expecting a ""too many characters, not enough time"" sort of movie, but I feel like the whole movie was purely about developing the characters as they acquire each party member. I wonder if it's just another burned out reviewer just looking to put out a review and nothing more.",qn0q4y
hjui2k5,"I suppose because what you mention is what was lacking. They lacked any flashing, they had basically just one dimension each (which you even proved in your comment) and that was it about it.

hjs6klf,"In 7000 years Druig never tried to control either a deviant or another Eternal? And despite learning that they’re robots, Ikarus’ betrayal and the unimind in effect, he never considers it a possibility or tries? 

Joke or not, the screenplay has that line and while the characters happily entertain the possibility of it, not a single one suggests anything to Druig after Ikarus betrays them - not even when Sersi demonstrates that the supposed limits of her powers against sentient beings no longer appeared to be true

If the audience considers the possibility after two and a half hours spent with these characters, how can we entertain that in-universe these characters wouldn’t consider it after 7000 years together? 

Whether possible or not, neither the characters or the screenplay address it as a potential action. 

Let’s not also forget that we have a character that can cast illusions against other Eternals which in itself is a cognitive alteration as the illusions aren’t real (as demonstrated in the beginning of the film when the bar patron touches Sprite’s illusionary hand)",qn0q4y
hlm183v,"The Eternals being synthetic is due to the deviants’ failings.

The Eternals themselves are supposedly synthetic (they’ve created these problems by changing their background in the movie) and yet somehow share biological instincts. 

With respect to whether mind  control works on them or not, there are throwaway lines regards Druig offering to tranquillise Thena in the past and Gilgamesh commenting that he asked Druig to put her to sleep so that he could get a break. We also see that Sprite’s illusions work on them despite being cognitive powers. 

The film offers statements that others here have argued as jokes, however, the film never addresses whether Druig can affect them or not and it’s not even suggested when they make their final plans in the third act.",qn0q4y

hjlh8mf,"Making it so that everything that has ever happened in the MCU prior to the Loki finale was decided by one person and the timeline was artificially manipulated by him and the TVA pruning any variants to the sacred timeline. This means that none of the characters had free will prior to this point--Tony Stark and Natasha Romanoff only made all of their decisions because Who Who Remains made it happen that way. Nobody is a hero and nobody is a villain, they're just a cosmic puppet--He Who Remains chose to prune the timelines where the heroes do bad things and where ""villains"" like Sylvie try to be heroes because he doesn't think that's in character for them. The showrunners explicitly confirmed this on Twitter and the finale makes it pretty clear when the timeline instantly starts splitting and the characters say free will has been introduced.

What's more, giving the TVA a means of infinite time travel (unlike, say, the cast in Endgame being limited by Pym particles) destroys the stakes because any time they make a mistake they can just travel back earlier in time and prevent it from happening. Also, the TVA has records of everything that ever happens in the past, present and future. Therefore, it should've been impossible for Loki and Sylvie to escape the TVA without being caught at an earlier point in time and impossible for Sylvie to have escaped as a child in the first place.

The TVA being staffed by variants is bullshit, they have records on everyone and everything so someone would've noticed themselves or their coworkers in the sacred timeline.

Loki was absolutely butchered in his own show. He almost never uses his powers even outside of the TVA, he's suddenly very weak and can get thrown around and beaten in fights by normal humans despite beating Thor and Cap in fights in the movies, he lets people he barely knows insult and belittle him, seeing footage of his heroic character arc leading up to Infinify War instantly makes him go through years of character development from a villain into a hero even though the Loki in the movies would've expressed some sort of doubt and believed he was being tricked (to say nothing of the fact that just seeing some clips of yourself experiencing character growth isn't the same as actually living through that character growth - remember 2014 Thanos wasn't instantly a changed man after seeing clips of 2018 Thanos in Endgame), and he could literally be removed from the show and events would still play out the same way because Sylvie is the one who does everything. Without Loki Sylvie would still infiltrate the TVA, find out where the Time Keepers are, destroy the Time Keepers, eventually get pruned or prune herself, enchant Alioth with help from Classic Loki, and then find and kill He Who Remains.

*The Leftovers* is actually a show that covers a topic similar to the snap and how people react to it. I only got round to watching it last year and I still think about  it daily. The premise is that 2% of the world population vanishes one day and no one knows why or where they went. It’s utterly uninterested in answering the question about where they went, what happened or why, but rather examines how society and people change after such an event that disproportionately affects some and theoretically shouldn’t affect others.

Modern filmmaking scares me a bit.

In the past, you would rely on a mixture of practical and CGI to come up with seamless results. It seems like Chloe Zhao mostly succeeded in this way, and even then the CGI for the Deviants still looked questionable.

With so many of these modern blockbusters, they rely so heavily on CGI as if they dont understand that it cant look as good without some practical elements anchoring the movie.

Look at Spider-Man 2 (2004) for instance. It still looks great. Look at how Doc Ock's arms look. They still feel incredibly real. This was a mixture of puppetry and CG.

In these modern films, they keep making the mistake of treating CGI like a magic wand.

Eternals, being synthetic, may not reproduce on their own, but an evolved Deviant could have offspring. That’s either Thanos’ parents directly, or ancient history to the Titans, who have now incorporated Eternal-Deviant DNA into their lineage.

hjfdnos,"Karun is told that his entire family, friends, country, species etc will be eradicated in a day and his responses are quipping things like ""I'm human so I'm biased"". The writing is so off that it shows very very clearly that the character's primary purpose is to be a comic relief regardless of the circumstances. MCU misses the chance to let emotional weight sink in or be able to put themselves in a character's shoes and think from their perspective and give them emotional range. Instead we get either shoehorned humor or emotional statements like these which don't mesh with the character expressing them. The character just comes across as a mouthpiece for the writers to do whatever they want at that point

Also, what good has Karun seen the Eternals do? We'll give him kingo because they seemed to share a close relationship but what about the other Eternals? All he's seen the Eternals do is them fighting off monsters which were only attacking them anyway. And then he's seen them realize their purpose and debate over dinner table whether his species should be wiped out or not. He then sees couple of the Eternals take the side of ""kill humans"" and leave, then witnesses Kingo (who was his friend) basically declare ""oh if they die they die lol"" and leave. Keep in mind that what they're discussing is Karun's family's demise here, his friend's demise, his world's demise. Yet, the character himself has no argument to make on humans' behalf, no plea, no desperation nothing

I think it's fair to criticize when something is written as shoddily as that. Honestly that scene feels a variation of the White Saviour trope, where you're expected to be grateful for the ""good intentions"" of your invader regardless of whether they're actually benefiting you or not",qn0q4y

hjesx70,"No, the size of the cast is one of the biggest issues. So many of these characters have interesting arcs and ideas to them but lack the screen time to develop it. So much telling and not showing, so many important moments told through montage. We don’t even see Ikaris and Sersi break up! 

Think about Boromir in Fellowship. How every scene and interaction with works to flesh him out as a man of unwavering, blind loyalty to Gondor that would lead him into recklessness. How his attempted betrayal of Frodo is a tense, drawn out moment and his turmoil is presented on screen and those final moments between him and Aragorn are intimate and tragic. 

Now can you give me any interaction in the early parts of this movie that develop why Ikaris would kill his fellow Eternals just to stay loyal to Arishem? We never see him talk about him, we never see him taking pride in his work, we never see the moment Ajak tells him about what they really do and his reaction to it. He just does the stuff when the plot needs him to! Do we even see the Eternals mourn him? Let alone Sersi? Lol.",qn0q4y
hjetfho,"Just to be clear, you don’t think that was a moment intended to be tragic? Just him killing himself so he could start over?

Also why is so you think he would get to start over? He completely dies flying into that sun. They don’t just respawn lol. They couldn’t even bring themselves to wipe Thena’s memory because that would mean losing who she is. I don’t see how we’re not supposed to view Ikaris flying into the sun as anything but a suicide brought on by inner turmoil and being unable to live with himself after what he did.",qn0q4y

I don't think up until now the MCU had ever shown anoher Titan clearly. There's just a deep background shot in Infinity War where reasonable people could argue if the other Titans looked like Thanos or not. Of course, 616 may have retconned that itself by now. I'm getting back in thanks to Marvel Unlimited but there are plenty of gaps in my knowledge from my years away.

Perhaps the relationship of A’Lars and Eros are similar to that of Ajak and the other Eternals, where she was kind of a mother figure to them. Thanos is either adopted by A’Lars or somehow the synthetic A’Lars was capable of conceiving a child on someone? 

It was a bit of a messy decision to make the Eternals robots, when they could have just been immortal and hence incapable of evolution.",qn0q4y
hjikamc,What app / platform are you using?,qn0q4y
hsk45yy,"It must be what or something similar to what the wiki says which is that he's an adoptive brother rather than blood brother. The TLDR to the rest of my reply is that everything so far points to Thanos being from a Titan race on Titan and Eternals all looking human.

Let me preface all this by saying I, of course, might be wrong. Chloe Zao did an [interview where they asked about this.
](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/eternals-spoiler-special-chloe-zhao-on-power-death-dogma-and-harry-styles) She kind of answers the ""why is he not purple"" question by essentially explaining that Eros ""is an Eternal"". Technically though, I could see how someone would argue this specific aspect is left a little bit up in the air in her answer and she might have only answered the first part of the question. I just feel like if we piece together all the info we have from other MCU content + the interview, it doesn't line up that they'd be actual brothers and Thanos would be exactly like his comic self unless something somewhere is retconned or something heavily implied turns out wrong. 

From the Loki show, we know that Titans were an actual species, we know Thanos is from Titan of course, he's called the ""son of A'Lars"" by Red Skull which I don't think an Eternal would since they are synthetic (but Red Skull calls Gamorah Thanos' daughter and she's not his actual daughter so I don't know how accurate he is lol) and the ""Mad Titan""/""Great Titan"". Would he have those titles even though he's not from that species? I don't know. Eternals all look human (unless Starfox is an exception on Titan or that scene where hundreds of Eternals are lined up is supposed to be misleading to us, but they were all shaped human like).",qn0q4y

Because when it comes to a superhero team where the strongest is a superman type character and everyone fights him, Eternals imo did it way better. The superman fight in justice league was the worst scene in both the snyder cut and theatrical cut imo.

hk5bnl8,"I just can't get behind Phastos influencing humanity through the ages, and then pinning Hiroshima on himself. Without seeing how he's personally connected to such a complex social and technological event, he's just as culpable as Sersi was when she handed over her knife which, at the beginning of the movie, was advertised in a museum as an artifact that shaped history. I would have liked some transparency I guess, but I see where you're coming from. We can probably assume he would have been 'inventing the plow' at each major step in our technological evolution, so maybe he brought us into the nuclear age or something.  


If anti-interference is taken into account, that would mean Phastos gave humanity something that lead to Atomic Bombs. Humanity reverse engineered whatever Phastos made. It could have been a microwave, an oven, a cyclotron, a satellite, headphones. I was assuming he was there and somehow helped create the actual atomic bombs, but we have no context, so it could have been anything. He might not have been near or around anyone important who he could have influenced. Or maybe he was. He feels responsible though, and like you said, I'm sure that must have felt heartbreaking.",qn0q4y

But they never interacted with the main protagonists or got in their way.

That would be the best way to handle that scenario. Include brief mentions of them on the news helping out.

That's all it needs to be.

Because it serves no purpose to the story. Seriously, why include that subplot at all? It adds nothing. I agree with u/MyDarkForestTheory, Phastos was just a loosely included character to quip and add some gayness.

hk0pqtk,"There is one problem with this interpretation. Throughout the movie, Ikaris didn't care a fig about Arishem's designs directly. Rather, he had his blind faith in whatever Ajak commanded. Even after his villian twist, most words he says (like something needs to be destroyed for others to be created, etc.) were probably what Ajak told him to keep him loyal to the mission for all those hundreds of years. All that loyalty to Arishem was actually loyalty to Ajak prior to her change in mind at the end. To give a similar example, imagine a soldier who was commanded to shoot down some innocent civilians, and then told that the mission was based on false intel. He is surely bound to have PTSD post discharge against his commanding officer, right?",qn0q4y

They all had interesting tidbits that the film couldn’t expand upon because there were so many. That’s just how I felt about it. 

Like, when Don Lee dies, I really didn’t feel anything. Making him Angelina Jolies ‘protector’ is a great narrative idea, and if that idea was expanded on I would’ve felt a lot more towards that scene, but because of how much the movie was trying to do, that scene just didn’t hit as hard as it should have. Specifically because him and Jolie had barely any time together prior.

hm2gxj2,"That's a different argument to your previous comment all together. Iron man's laser fit the established rules in their universe; in this movie they said an Eternal being born would be destructive to the Earth but nothing we saw actually suggested that at all (an arm erupting had minimal consequences). Not only that, but until now we have never seen any evidence that the Earth they live on is different from ours in terms of geography or geological makeup, so just because Iron Man can shoot lasers it has absolutely nothing to do with the universal rules MCU has already established with in regard to our own planet. MCU doesn't need to be ***realistic*** but it needs to be ***internally consistent***

Suspension of disbelief can only go so far, and still needs to abide by the rules of that universe. Lord of the Rings has dragons, but that would be irrelevant to the bullshit that would be Aragon firing a laser from his mouth without any explanation after establishing that humans are less magical than elves and wizards in their universe but showing them not to be capable of that.",qn0q4y

hy7w6gr,"If you take away what the Eternals are, the emotions, the will, you get Deviants. The Deviants are beings synthesized to gate-keep nature from killing intelligent life. Deviants could hunt, like animals, but they had no language or complex reasoning, self-preservation, but no self-awareness. They found out they could survive by gate-keeping intelligent life, prolonging a planet's emergence.

Eternals are the next iteration of Deviant. Same mission, gate-keep nature, but also kill Deviants, the things that beat nature and are now gate-keeping intelligent life. 

Remember, Arishem isn't perfect. He failed with the deviants, and in multiple instances it's shown that the Eternals, while more effective than the deviants, aren't perfect either. 

I honestly think they were left on earth because he's automated things to the point where he's confident things will go according to his designs. And in however many thousands of years, however many birthed celestials, Earth is the only planet broke his Eternals.  


I think the Deviants and Eternals both broke, but they broke in different ways. The Deviants were trying to protect themselves at the cost of the lives of humans.

Yes but none of them had a direct connection to the death of Ajax.

But then he hit a roadblock and he failed at keeping the celestial alive, not because he physically was unable to but because he couldn't bring himself to kill the only other eternal he loved. 

So he was hurting in 3 fronts. Probably in the idea that he wasn't mentally strong enough to kill Sersi and save the celestial, the fact that he killed the only other eternal he had a deep emotional bond with, and Sersi now knowing what he did to try and reach that goal. His life after that, celestial or no celestial was changed forever and so he probably decided to end it.

I'm also a little confused about the premise because if they keep planting new Celestial seeds over time, you'd think they'd stop sending the deviants by now and just send Eternals.

Maybe there are child Eternals in case any of them want to masquerade as a family. I personally don't know why they were programmed to have feelings or free will or anything like that. If Robb Stark was the strongest by far, why not just send like, 3 of his model and an Ajak to heal them?

There was so much going on it with character introductions - including exploring their motivations and worldviews- that it would have been absurd to give each character a development arc.

They were each distinct though and I don’t feel like anyone’s exposition was rushed",qn0q4y

They've built a huge playground where these characters can show up again . . . more Eternals movies, their own solo movies, their own Disney + show, and other characters/franchises movies and shows.

My guess is Druig did something similar, only putting Athena to sleep because Athena let him. She's not in full crazy mode all the time, only occasionally.

A very minor hint, definitely needed to be built upon more before the ending.",qn0q4y
hjioo5a,"I think ikaris being an extremely faithful person is his character. I feel like that shouldn't be too hard for someone to accept as a person, they exist irl too. He was told to follow arishem, his identity is built solely around it, and he is too closed off from everything else because he is very unmoving and stringent. He wasn't able to change at all, or mingle with regular world as much as the others to allow himself to be changed, because he can't let go of his identity. Incredible fear of change. Fits well with him being a golden boy/mama's boy/party pooper


Idk, I see several comments of ""show, don't tell"" and I feel like that's exactly what I got in the movie. I could feel their characters. Even without something as blatant as Ajek's you have strong faith line. My only problems with the move were the deviants evo stuff, and how that pulled time from more character/human moments to give to action. 


Hmm as I'm typing this, I feel like there's more of them coming through. It seems like each of them has this eternalness to them. Gil's eternal devotion, Ajek's eternal compassion, Sersi's eternal empathy, Sprite/bitterness, ikari/faithfulness, Kingo's positivity.

hjp5y21,"> We never see him talk about him, we never see him taking pride in his work, we never see the moment Ajak tells him about what they really do and his reaction to it. 

So... telling? 

I'm not surprised people on this sub have no idea what ""show, don't tell"" means. Someone gave you gold for that post, dear lord...",qn0q4y
hjf0f8u,"That's exactly how I saw it and I'm surprised no one else did. He did something truly fucked up, but was a coward and did it because he assumed he would be mind wiped and forget. When he realizes he has to live with the guilt of killing 2 of his family members, he couldn't handle it.",qn0q4y
hjgbd4z,"I think from the character standpoint it is tragic - he had to betray his principles, murder his friend, and murder his God and what does he have to show for it. 

I think it was implied especially from the World Forge scene that they all die during the emergence, but they get resurrected at the forge without new memories except for Thena this time who remembers her past emergences. Also, that's how it works in the comics - Eternals die doing their missions and the world forge (located in the earth) keeps resurrecting them.

While I think it's valid to interpret it as straight up suicide, Icarus' still seems to be very much to be a religious man of faith in the end. With the knowledge of resurrection, he may be looking for relief of his guilt/pain also just via penance. A bit more improbable, but maybe he thought he could go back and warn the celestial host and perhaps they could save tiamut.",qn0q4y
hjkx5ar,No they believe she would lose who she was this was before they found out they are built by the celestials and are stored in the soul forge for millions of years that’s what always happens with the Eternals they can basically respawn and start a new life with each death and their mementoes are locked in the forge by Arishem,qn0q4y
hjuk1xw,"but they start over when the planet is destroyed and they are protected by the energy of that celestial. He vaporized in the Sun. Thats two different things. Like Ajak when she died, they've mourned her, even after learning about their past lives. If they could be ressurected without worries anytime, then why  bother. 

But, it's MCU, they sure can bring them back just by saying they've restored their souls and implanted those stored memories.",qn0q4y

hjlhwtu,"Infinity War confirms the existence of an earth Jesus when Quill quips about the ""what master do you serve"" line.

hjekt5a,"The Ebony Blade was made by Merlin and has been passed down through Whitman's family for many generations. It grants great power (lessee, [looking up](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Ebony_Blade)... cut through anything, protect user from death, deflect magic) but slowly turns the wielder into a bloodthirsty lunatic asshole to the point they're gonna have to be put down. I thiiiiiink once you start using it you can't stop (or at least it's real difficult). That's why bro was like, ""I can't... but I must!"" I didn't know this part until giving myself a refresher but apparently it was recently retconned that you have to be impure of heart to even start using the blade (news to both me and Dane.) Honestly I have no idea WTF he thinks he's going to do with that... the Ebony Blade is powerful but I've never thought of Black Knight as remotely operating on a Celestial level stage. I read a mini series (turns out [regular series quickly cancelled](https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/20788/black_knight_2015_-_2016)) where he took over an entire fantasy world as warlord and that made sense but most he could do against a Celestial is give it a paper cut.

(Also, it is fucking wild that Black Knight is in a movie... he's been around since the late 60s and never come close to breaching the public consciousness.)

The other poster is right about Starfox (real name, Eros) in terms of popularity so the most I can say is I think he's generally portrayed as a good guy but he's also a ladies' man playboy. His main power is controlling other people's emotions, hence the trial they mentioned.

EDIT: Not sure about subreddit etiquette linking to a site with a link to subscribe to MU. If it's against general norms I can remove it. Figured if anyone already has it they can link right to the series on their device. (Along with additional minor edits in body.)",qn0q4y

It felt plenty bleak to me but in a more understated way. Like they want to panic but they know there's no good that'll do. But I think the breadth of emotions was portrayed quite well. I especially liked the bonding moment with Thena and Sersei.",qn0q4y

hjf9mu7,"Alternatively, they could have just not adapted Thanos as an Eternal (assuming that's the route they're going).

hjegw2q,"I know which comic you're talking about; it was written by Kieron Gillon earlier this year in Marvel Comics' latest attempt at movie/TV alignment. Because that's what the comics have unfortunately become in recent years - they're less stories of their own creation and more vehicles of departmental synergy. I actually called this on a thread two years ago on [r/marvelstudios](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios) when all the Eternals just *happened* to die en masse offscreen back in the Avengers comics in mid-2018. The comic writers had to have known by then that large changes to the looks of the Eternals cast were coming. They were simply getting ready for that.

Ridloff had already long been casted when the character's loss of hearing happened in the comics. Hell, if it came out this year, then it almost certainly was written after the movie was already done filming. It was more about matching the comics with the MCU, not the other way around.",qn0q4y

Honestly, I thought if anything, it made it clear that his kid was adopted instead of having us wonder if Eternals are capable of having biological children

> I couldn't tell you a single character trait about that character

You could say the same about some of the other characters (I agree that there just wasn’t enough development in place for half of the characters). But I think Phastos served more purposes than just being funny and gay lol. He showed how the Eternals played a role in shaping history and advancing human technology; he was one of the earliest to dissent alongside Druig; he showed one way how an Eternal was able to fully integrate into society by having a spouse, a child, a house. There was that whole thing about him growing jaded about humanity until he had a family and gained some hope about their capacity to love and build instead of destroy

The gay stuff was literally like 2 minutes of screentime. No need to give it so much weight.

Unlike other speedsters for whom the speed is mere physical prowess, for flash it is more about going into this weird state/realm where he can basically see laws of nature unfold in front of him as well as manipulate them depending upon energy he holds. For example when he taps into Speedforce he basically slows down the flow of time of his surrounding or is able to perceive it in slower rate (Depending on Comic Explanation you're looking at) so analogy often associated with other speedsters such as Quicksilver of X-Men series is more applicable to Flash than to Quicksilver (which should have been more akin to MCU Quicksilver). So he is not fast because his muscles have these abilities to twist and turn at faster rate but because he is looking at world in different way, where every surrounding event have slowed down so all he does is run ,which is normal running/action from his perspective but for everyone else his actions happened at blink of an eye.

Or better yet kill all of them and drain the celestial too and fly off into space to fight Arishem.

hjl1lip,"Bruh I'm an indian and have been a practicing Hindu my whole life. Santana Dharma has very little to do with rolling over and accepting whatever shitshow so-called gods just profess. Sanatana Dharma means every person has to follow their own Dharma, their own duty to the right. There is no ""divine plan"" whatsoever, what part of Hinduism are you talking about? Gods in Hinduism are often very very wrong, indra was wrong in assaulting ahalya and got punished for it, Ravana was wrong even though he was a great worshipper of Shiva, shiva was wrong in slicing off ganesh's head etc etc. 

The point is never that humans should just roll over and accept whatever happens just because ""divine plan"" of a few of the million gods which are aspects of Brahman? The point is that you have to always carry out your own Dharma, your own duty to the righteousness, no matter how much turmoil it causes you. Arjuna hates the idea of fighting his relatives but as Krishna says, his Dharma is to fight, even if it's his own relatives for the sake of what is right. Hinduism says that every person has his Dharma which he should follow, each person's Dharma is different depending on who they are. For example, a merchant's dharma would be to not cheat his customer, a king's dharma would be to protect his people. As a human, it would have been Karun's dharma to fight for his species, to fight to uphold the lives. There was zero hindu philosophy in the horrible dialogue Karun was given, it was just pandering to the heroes from a character who had no reason to pander and every reason to be emotionally wrecked at how they were casually discussing the genocide of his species. His Dharma as a son, a husband, a father would be to *protect*.",qn0q4y
hjl2xh9,"So many justifications just to refuse admitting that marvel just can't make their characters do anything else because they are trapped in a cesspool of undercutting their own emotional beats with cheap humor. Yes, some people use humor as a coping mechanism, but do you really think that quip will likely be the response of someone who is chiming in in a debate about *the existence or genocide of his entire world*???

You ask what the fuck is he supposed to do about a space god? You'd think that making an impassioned plea on the behalf of keeping the planet alive to the only people who can make it happen who are sitting on the very table with him would be a good start. You'd think someone would at the very least *try* to plead the case for their parents, siblings, spouses, children. You'd think even if someone uses humor as a defence mechanism it would be harsh and scathing and confused the way tony Stark's is because its coming from a place of turbulence.

Man, the number of hoops Marvel fanatics have to jump through to just defend bad writing. You know admitting something is flawed doesn't mean hating it right? Just imagine yourself sitting a table with people casually discussing the extinction of your family and tell me you wouldn't even *try* to save them, would just roll over and immediately accept it and follow them around like a loyal puppy to someone who looks down on you like an inferior species",qn0q4y

* During the flatbread and fucking montage, have Sersi scold him for trying to sneak something sweet into the bread.


* At Gilgamesh's dinner, he could ask very seriously if there's dessert and they can all laugh at him. For a more sombre beat, when Sersi gets up, instead of the generic 'where are you going?' 'getting some air', he can protest like 'you haven't finished your cake!', and she can smile and tell him to finish it, but the camera cuts back to him concerned, not buying it. Almost like they know each other!


* With the Twinkies, since there's no payoff to the love-hate relationship they allude to between him and Druig, have Sersi swap Druig for the Twinkies instead and then wordlessly deposit them onto an armful of sweets/carbs Ikaris is silently assembling.


* At the end when she's walking with her new boyfriend, reference sweet stuff before they get into their lines to show she's actually mourning the guy she loved for 5k years. Maybe she pauses, glances at the sun, then picks up a handful of dirt and uses her power to turn it into a heap of sugar to her tea.

Even if he traveled at half that speed (which is a generous assumption) that would still take him about 15 minutes of continuous effort to kill himself. 15 minutes for him to contemplate what he's about to do, the life he lead and the family he leaves behind, all the while keeping his foot on the gas pedal. 15 minutes during which at any moment a thought could've popped into his head that maaaybe this wasn't the best idea. He could've turned back at any second. Know of the other suicide attempt in the MCU that I think of? Remember Zemo? He was probably contemplating suicide for a longer time but the act in itself only required a moment of will. If you were to compare them it would be like if Zemo had to empty into his head a thousand bullets, reloading each one and knowing he could still stop his death with the last one.

So if they were sent to fight deviants on other planets for millions of years, and only go to Earth after the deviants are there, there should have been so much time from when the first batch of deviants were sent til whenever they got to Earth for Arashem to realize the deviants were no good for his plan.

> Yet they never touch on how being gay throughout history is pretty different throughout the eras. Also, the Hiroshima scene was maddingly dumb.

I actually really like your idea! I think the filmmakers intended it to be more of a passing part of his identity, like I said we tend to focus on what’s different and so seeing a gay character on the screen is something that we are working towards normalizing. But if it became a highlighting point of his character then that could have been good too, just not what I think they were going for. Would it not feel like pandering to you though if they dedicated more time to the struggles of being gay/bi? 

And agreed, the Hiroshima sequence could have been a lot better. A lot of the flashback sequences felt incredibly forced in the name of character development

> I take issue when it only feels like it was included to meet diversity quotas. But to me, Phastos was so underdeveloped that it felt like his DEFINING character trait. Which is why it felt like pandering BS.

Do you think it would’ve felt less like pandering if he was developed in other ways? Or do you also need the gay part to be more than just a passing fact?

hlxytgl,"‘ A lot of people seem adamant to shit on this movie by nitpicking on things that are not explicitly spelled out’

Audiences tend to dissect a film in such fashion when it isn’t working and they try to figure out why, like an autopsy of sorts. 

A screenplay is meant to be very tightly written with no wasted dialogue or action, and so with a 157 minute film it’s already an issue when the results are neither a rounded three arc story or measurable arcs for each character. What then are the 157 minutes filled with? 

It is not reasonable that a character with mind control abilities is present throughout the film, purposely kept away from proceedings for much of it, commented multiple times on his uses with another Eternal’s ailments, employed in the final act for use against a birthing Celestial, and not once is it ever raised by another character that he use that ability on Ikarus - even if to confirm for the audience that he cannot. Druig’s function within the team and usefulness in the plot went from being Chekhov's Gun to a Red Herring and as revealed by the third act, his role in the story itself is ultimately superfluous and he contributes nothing. 

Your proposal that Druig could affect Thena only in her weakened state not only contradicts your former position on the film having demonstrated that their synthetic nature prevents all such attempts, you are inserting an idea into the film to remedy something while simultaneously criticising others for highlighting that the film does not address this plot point.

A one time affair that likely never occurred again.

While I don’t know of cannibalism, the number human sacrifices that occurred on the steps of the Templo Mayor and other temples throughout Tenochtitlan and the empire was and is unprecedented in human history. There’s really no way around that. The Spaniards didn’t note it occurring among the Inca, Muisica or in the Philippines, nor did they make not of it as much among other sacrificial Mesoamerican kingdoms, states and empires like the Mayans, the Purepechua, Zapotec, Mixtec, Huastec, etc. or even among other Nahua peoples (which the Aztecs were) like the Tlaxacalecos.

>Why you people resort to the same cliches instead of studying deeper? If you only know wikipedia sources and ""muh sacrifices"", why are you insisting so much on trying to discredit indigenous cultures? Dunning-Kruger much?

Because sacrifices were an integral part of the Aztec Empire’s make up. The fact that you think people are out to “discredit” “indigenous cultures” (whatever nebulous thing that is) is rather telling so don’t pull Reddit’s favorite psychological term out like that.

Btw, the only reason the Aztecs or any civilization between the Huastecs and the southern Inca are considered “indigenous” is because of Spain. If they were judged as how they were in the pre-Hispanic era, they would not fit the indigenous definition by any margins of today that would not also make Americans or Europeans “indigenous” also. The Aztecs didn’t even originate in Mesoamerica as their legends told of them coming from Atzlan, hence their name.",qn0q4y

>They had. A pretty complex logographic one, by the way.

It was not really a complete writing system. The Mayans did but the Aztecs glyphs were to supposed to be accompanied by tallied records and oral memory. They only really transitioned into a writing system in its own right after the Spanish arrived but by then Nahuatl was almost completely written in the Latin alphabet for official as well literature and vernacular purposes. Nezahualcoyotl‘s poems and verses became a big hit after written in Latinized Nahuatl as well as Spanish.

>They did. They just barely used for transportation because they didn't were no horses in America to pull carriages.

Human carts were used in the Old World before they were put on draft animals (or even before draft animals were introduced). The wheel they invented was put to use for milling grain and making pottery, or sometimes for a child’s toy.

While not necessarily always that important (was the Great Egyptian Pyramids were built without them), it’s a little dishonest to say that “invented” in that manner.

>A simple Google search would have answered this. Just admit already you don't know shit about the Aztecs and fuck off.

Some major problems were not resolved until the Emperor Nezahualcoyotl came up with some remarkable innovations when he wasn’t spitting some bars (he was an accomplished poet in his days) that helped fixed some longstanding problems but there always some overarching danger of breaches.

After the Spaniards conquered Tenochtitlan, a lot of infrastructure was destroyed. They initially thought about repairing them in addition to an adapted Spanish style city layout they were planning but with Tenochtitlan/Mexico City’s ever increasing population during it’s rebuilt, not to mention the massive numbers of Catholic pilgrims for various reasons, including for Our Lady of Guadeloupe, the Spaniards eventually decided to give up and drain the lake beds so they could grow the city horizontally.",qn0q4y

hmeawyo,"Again, you're missing the point.  I'm not ignoring the explanations in the story; they work hand in hand with the anti-White agenda.

His suicide is the dream of ""the woke"" - a White man just going ahead and killing himself so they don't have to do it.  So in a sense, yes, he does redeem himself because he debases himself.  The casting and the imagery of Whites being ""the problem"" is what the MCU is after.  Also, Phastos doesn't ""cause"" Hiroshima; he inspired technology that led to it (and again, no coincidence that it's the U.S. that took the action depicted).  

The bottom line is that the MCU is endeavoring to sweep away most of its White male characters (to say nothing of the crime WB/DC is perpetrating with Superman).  Captain America - already turned black.  Thor - likely replaced by a female.  Spider-Man - probably killed off to make way for a racial stunt character.  Iron Man - killed and replaced by a black female.  Hawkeye - female protege waiting in the wings.  The casting for the FF movie ought to be a laugh riot.  Ikaris was just killed off super fast.

I agree, that scene felt shoehorned in. And you're right, representation matters. I remember there was a group of girls in front of me at Endgame and they were beyond excited when that scene arrived. But the difference? My gay friend who I saw this movie with also didn't like Phastos and that scene. It's not really an ""empowering"" scene like the other one. It's just a family scene, which would be nice, but we don't shit about Phastos at that point, so it doesn't feel earned.",qn0q4y

Just imagine being a person who breathes a sigh of relief if a hero's powers/job is taken over by someone the same race as them. I mean the new Black Widow is white. Did you smile, and then catch yourself after realizing, ""still female dammit!"", and turn up your rage?",qn0q4y

hjp92e0,">How is it pretty clear he didn't want to?

The fact that he didn't volunteer is probably the biggest one. No one jumped up to take care of her when she requested not to have her memories wiped, only Gilgamesh did. Gilgamesh explains at the end that he loved her when saying why he did it. 

>He never said he didn't want to and he cared for all humans just not certain ones. 

Let me clarify, he cared more for the humans. As for Druig he never said he did want to care for her either and at that specific moment he had to choose. He obviously had the option to help her or leave and he chose to leave with the humans.

>He wanted to stop all their wars and just force them to be peaceful. If he could just control her like he controls others, how is it much more a burden than controlling an entire group of people?

Because that's what was more important to him. You have to understand that these eternals didn't all know each other and 7000 years within millions is not that long. They didn't ALL love each other, in their minds they were a task force with a mission and that is it. At least those were the memories they had with the exception of Ajax who knew everything. In fact as far as Sersi knew this was her first mission.

During that time bonds did develop, Ikaris fell in love with Sersi, Gilgamesh fell in love with Thena, Druig grew to care for the humans and developed a close relationship with Makkari. Ajax also grew to care for the humans. Sure the 7000 years made them become well aquatinted but not all of them were ride or die for each other. As evident by Druig choosing to care for the humans rather than Thena.",qn0q4y

> It's not really an ""empowering"" scene like the other one. It's just a family scene, which would be nice, but we don't shit about Phastos at that point, so it doesn't feel earned.

Right, and it's okay that it's not an empowering scene, but it feels shoehorned because there wasn't much about Phastos up until that point so it's almost made to feel like a ""wow!!"" moment. I can see where you're coming from.

I guess you've never heard of ""crt"" which has its basis in hatred of Whites.  

So in *Eternals*, why was Phastos not the turncoat, or Makkari, or Sersi, or Gilgamesh?

So you believe that classic, iconic characters should have their races changed?  What idiocy.  Why does that cause someone to ""breathe a sigh of relief""?  I've actually read more comments from black people that they hate that Superman is being turned black than who are glad about it.

There's no sudden shortage of white roles. Think of Star-Lord. He was a C-list nothing character. Perfect candidate for diversity switch up. But they used a white actor. There was controversy because they switched a character to white in Dr. Strange. They knew it would court controversy and they still did it. Why do so, if they're anti-white?

The turncoat in Eternals was simply the most powerful character. None of those others would seem a threat to take on all the others. Ikarus is credibly powerful to do so.

What characters are getting their race changed? Steve Rogers is not becoming black. Neither is Tony Stark. Clint Barton is not becoming female. New characters are taking on their old 'job position'.

In what world does a new 'employee' have to be the same race or gender as the previous 'employee'?


But is Marvel even doing it that much?

Black Widow - Natasha Romaov. (white) ->  Yelena Belova (white)

Ant Man - Hank Pym (white) -> Scott Lang (white)

hjpb3n0,">He didn't have the option to do so because he can't do it. I don't think he's powerful enough to control other Eternals. 

And I'm saying he's powerful enough to do it so long as the eternal he's controlling is letting him control him. If Thena put some kind of mental fight i don't think Druig would be able to. So when he put her to sleep it must have been Thena letting him put him to sleep, hence why she knew about it. 

>And like I said earlier, if he can do it, he probably can't do it for long.

I'm not arguing this fact. 

>Phastos was able to contain Ikaris for a little bit but he wasn't powerful enough to do it for long.

Sure, and that's with Ikaris trying to control his powers and break free.

>I feel the same would have happened to Druig if he tried. He just wouldn't have been able to control her for long if at all.

Yes, if any eternal tried to put up a mental fight i agree. But considering Gilgamesh and Thena both confirmed it Thena must have willingly let herself be put to sleep. Similar to how Ego let Mantis put him to sleep.",qn0q4y

Counter examples 'don't count'. Only that which serves your narrative survives into the realm of 'relevance'.

In Knives Out the hero is aided by a white hero detective. They both only survive and progress due to sheer luck.

And who moves on to the sequel? The white hero.

The movie does deal with race, (like them not remembering where she is from) but you omit mention of the movie also dealing with class just as much. The family is the way they are because of money. Writing money.

It doesn't matter that Rogers didn't become black? But it does that one of multiple Superman projects might change Kent. Note multiple. There's also a separate projects in talks for a completely different black Superman, and of course more Cavil playing Kent.

We're in the multiverse and reboot era. Peter Parker will still be around even when Miles Morals shows up. There will be another white Steve Rogers and Tony Stark in some far off reboot. There will be a white male Doctor Who again, there will be a white male Bond again.

It will be normal to have so many different diverse versions cycling again and again. Hell, it probably is now for younger people.

What you're calling insane is simply choosing to put actual effort into diversity.

It bothers you because it's 'not normal'. It's upsetting to your default world view so you become a Status Quo Warrior.

Ikarus and Sersi. Gemma Chan was a highlight. The idea of the deviants able to evolve after each kill because they’re literally growing more sentient each time. The Mad Weary representing an actual con of them living as long as they do. The visuals are impressive. The lore is super interesting.
