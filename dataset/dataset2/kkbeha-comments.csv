ghs2tv8,"I didn’t fully understand the casting against type with the men until Al Monroe (Chris Lowell) showed up, and I was like full pikachu face OH. The fact that the men were purposely chosen because they were known as “harmless” really speaks to the film’s message. In retrospect, I should have got the message when McLovin appeared.

I was so so so hopeful that Ryan (Bo Burnham) would do the right thing. I kept expecting him to burst through the door while Cassie was alone with Al. I think Ryan’s complete spinelessness stung so much because we have all known that “good guy.”",kkbeha

ghmebgv,"The movie was incredible : it somehow manages to indulge revenge fantasies while also subverting their guilty pleasures.

&#x200B;

So while Nina's gang (?) rape and suicide are avenged by Cassandra, the film chronicles the self destructive nature of revenge itself.

&#x200B;

To some extent, the film was really about a grief stricken woman trying to alleviate her own guilt and shame by shaming others into feeling more (or truly)  responsible - and the avenging angel is invariably punished by her own righteous anger regardless.

&#x200B;

The fact that the film also succeeds as an indictment of rape culture is equally incredible: it was able to call into question  shameful social norms and attitudes through her own questionable actions.

&#x200B;

The casting againgst type was one of the film's many coups or strategic   manoeuvres - it reinforced the theme of the normalization of rape  culture (or the everyday fact that rapists and rape apologists don't come with warning signs  and are amongst the people we normally like and trust)

\- Carey Mulligan flinching when Alfred Molina made sudden movements toward her - god knows how many dangerous situations Cassie had been in with other men, I thought that was a realistic reaction

\- Ryan calling Cassie a ""stupid bitch"" when telling her he loved her was a little jarring on first viewing, even as a cute lil joke... Made total sense in retrospect. Comments like that made by men, even when unintentional, even when packaged in a cute way, give affirmation to misogynists. Just like the character of Ryan as whole. Ofc women and queer folk have reclaimed words like bitch and slut for themselves, but I can't really get behind straight men saying them. Until they become fully gender-neutral terms, at least.

\- Alison Brie bordering on breaking the fourth wall while walking into Cassie's parents Weirdly Baroque sitting room. Seems like production just wanted to shoot on a cool-looking set and was like, fuck it, we don't need to explain it",kkbeha

It was like what a survivor might hear. “It’s not your fault” and “it’s going to be okay”, etc. It just stood out to me, cuz besides Cassie, Nina didn’t get that. Everyone blamed her, told her she deserved it, didn’t believe her, and these shitty doctor guys just comfort their poor shitty murderer creep groom-to-be.

Self defense against Cassie? Sure, but I think the reason the film shows the full time it would take to suffocate someone speaks to how Al could have stopped at any point. He could overpower her without killing her. But he just kept going.",kkbeha

ghtrexr,"Hoooly fuck.

I went into this movie having accidentally heard something about a suicide and a murder. So I assumed she murders a rapist and another one that gets caught kills himself. Nope.

Saddest thing when the bedroom scene happened, I was legitimately floored. Stopped watching for a moment to pull up the Wikipedia page and spoil that line of plot because I could not believe it. It actually feels like someone you know in real life died. That’s rare. Could not watch that part, seeing her under the pillow. I felt so hopeless when she died and it seemed as if it was for nothing, with Al and the other guy trying to cover it up and reduce fault. Just pure dread as life seemingly goes on the exact way it shouldn’t.

I really wish she got to see the plan through.

God, this movie is going to stick with me for ages. 10/10. Neat idea breaking the wall and having the casting be a factor in the subject. I saw ‘Ryan being in the video’ a mile away but didn’t ruin much. 

Some pretty strong dialogue in there too with Cassie asking the one guy if he’s ever scored in daylight, same with her reminding the Dean how differently you frame things when it’s about someone you love.

Really liked the attention to detail too - when they were first mentioning Al Monroe, I went back to see if he was on the list. Sure enough later find out he was, as Alex

Incredibly tough to forgive Jordan and I don’t even know if it’s the right answer in a vacuum, but I’m glad as it seems that was the only way her plan would work. I just wish we knew the extent of the legal punishment.

ghwipnj,"What an amazing film, I haven't felt such a strong emotional connection to the protagonist since Rosamund Pike's Gone Girl performance.

It left me feeling unsatisfied in a satisfying way, which is something I didn't expect from this movie. The trailer really didn't do this film justice, I went in thinking this would be kinda campy, but got the complete opposite.

Everything about the soundtrack, the acting, and the cinematography was amazing, **except one part:** the mood and the editing in the pharmacy montage was just a really strange choice, it caught me off guard in what was supposed to be a film with dark themes. I know it was to get us invested in Cassie and Ryan's relationship, but the whole rom-com vibe just didn't seem to fit well with the rest of the film.

Anyway, will definitely be recommending this movie to my friends, it was a very worthwhile watch and it's definitely on par with masterpieces like Gone Girl.",kkbeha
gishol8,"I liked how the movie really fucked with our perception of Cassie. For most of the movie, I 100% believed she paid that guy to take advantage of Madison (Allison Brie). It makes you sit with that thought for a long time, and still root for a character who may have done something just as awful as Al and his friends. When it's finally cleared up that nothing happened, it's a bit of a sigh of relief that Cassie didn't do something so horrible, but she still made Madison believe it happened, and probably would never have told her the truth if she hadn't come to Cassie's house. 

I also thought about the long, awful scene showing Cassie dying. The entire movie shies away from showing any assault. The guys Cassie goes home with always stop before it goes too far, we never see what happens with Madison, and we only hear what happens in the video of Nina. But when we get to Cassie being suffocated, we get the entire process, front and center, and it really shakes you as a viewer. It's clear that Cassie didn't fully expect or necessarily even want to die (even though she had those whole texting and mailing thing planned), which makes it more realistic unfortunately. Cassie easily walking in, drugging and hurting those guys and getting away scot free was an ending fit for a campy revenge thriller, but I'm glad the movie stuck with something darker and more realistic.

Another thing, I've been thinking about the scene with Cassie and Nina's mom. Nina's mom seems much more happier and at peace than where Cassie is, so it shows that recovery and acceptance is possible, it's just a path that Cassie refused to take. I would've liked a little more focus on, or Nina's mom pointing out that Cassie wasn't the one assaulted. Nina was, but Cassie was putting this title of hard done by avenger on herself. 

I don't know how I feel about Cassie achieving success and revenge in death. As I said, her ruining the lives of everyone and sitting back satisfied and at peace wouldn't of worked either, but it's still a very depressing conclusion that shows there's no happy endings in stories of sexual assault.",kkbeha

ghkxmhg,"This movie was initially enjoyable as a viewer, but ultimately difficult to process as someone who has often fantasized about seeking revenge against those who have wronged me. The film really demonstrates the emotional, physical, and psychological toll that the pursuit of revenge can take on a person. In the end, the main character does achieve her goal of sending the rapist to prison (and on his wedding day no less), but at the cost of her own life. The ending should have been gratifying, but instead it left me feeling hollow, which I assume was the writers intention. I still wanted “the bad guy” to lose, but more than that, I also wanted “the good guy” to win (the good guy being the protagonist, Cassie.) The movie shows that unfortunately both men and women can be inherently “bad,” but few are capable of real change and redemption. At the same time, others may come across as “nice,” when in reality they are not as kind as they appear, while a rare, select few are truly “good.” Regardless, no one and nothing is worth putting before your own life and sanity. To me, this was not just a film about sexual assault, but also about the consequences of suffering from mental health issues.",kkbeha

\- slyly taking her to his apartment on date one, which understandably upset her, though she forgave him because she wanted to believe he made an error in judgment

\- him still being good friends with that toxic group of people from med school, saying he ""couldn't get rid of them"" even though when we meet them we see they're incredibly vacuous, vain and narcissistic. also him being oblivious to Nina's death/the events that led up to it.

\-him jokingly calling her a ""miserable bitch"" during that scene where they admitted they were falling for each other. while this could easily be shrugged off, it also lit up my own internal warning signal since men who call women ""bitches"" even in jest are often.....not always, but often not to be trusted.

glm7iaq,"Minor superficial opinion but watched this a second time with a friend who'd been wanting to see it (enjoyed it even more than the first viewing), but ugh I love Cassie's fashion in the movie. Obviously the specifically-tailored outfits for each bar scenario are genius (business casual for the business bar, hipster-y for McLovin, dolled-up trashy for Sam Richardson), but even her daywear was incredible. The braid when she first meets Ryan, that pink fuzzy sweater, the pink pullover and jeans in the pharmacy scene... iconic look after iconic look in this movie, major props to the wardrobe and production designers!",kkbeha
gjfrg7y,"The movie was such an *amazing* character study of Cassie, her weekly routine was going to get herself killed eventually (I'm presuming the red lines and names in her notebook are the marks who got violent) and it made so much sense for the character because of course she wouldn't bother moving on in any area of her life because she was that entrenched in this cycle that was going to kill her eventually (whether she could articulate that to herself or not)  and she didn't *care*. She keeps putting herself in danger time and time again with no measurable results other than a list of men who might think twice next time or who might have it out for her in the future. It's never-ending with no discernible end goal in sight. Until Ryan! Whose orbit breaks the cycle and sends her spinning out in both directions- kicking off the revenge plots while also bringing *life* back into her life ...until those two worlds come crashing into each other (that gut wrench when you hear his voice on the tape, my god). And when she goes to the bachelor party, it's this final escalation of her character into something new, crossing a new violent line, that feels so inevitable yet might never have happened had a few things turned out differently. At its heart it's a candy-coloured tragedy.

And what a movie! The violence and suggestions of violence were never where I expected them. Cassie isn't hurting any of her weekly nice guys (despite the vibes from the trailer) and the first real moments of horror is Cassie seemingly setting up two women to be raped which was absolutely *terrifying* and sickening to watch. And the movie doesn't let you completely out of that fear until Madison arrives with the video significantly later in the film and you find out Cassie didn't actually let that happen. And I found Cassie's death shocking, during the physical fight I thought she was going to accidentally kill Al but obviously not.

I thought that Al was going to get away with murdering Cassie at the end, the amount of relief and joy I felt when that first scheduled text arrived was incredible.",kkbeha

""I don't remember!"" - as Cassie says: it didn't have an impact huh? Imagine how much of an impact it had on the victim, how much they remembered it.

""I didn't even do anything"" - Showcasing denial OR the literal fact that they didn't do anything to help the situation/victim, which is also awful.

It's also clear to me that Cassie didn't kill anybody, since the fedora-guy said Jerry talked to him after his night-turned-bad with Cassie. She wanted to keep scaring men & women who participate in keeping injustice going, so she did it in ways that allowed for her to keep doing it.

& I hate him, but Joe running away at the end made me laugh so hard for some reason, also the fedora-guy running away from Cassie and whimpering lol.

gh4bx0s,"I think the biggest message of the film is that there’s no truly winning when you’ve been sexually assaulted. Yes, you can get restitution or justice but you never come out on top. Every fantasy of revenge doesn’t amount to what was taken from you and it leaves you feeling hollow. It’s sad and you may win a little but there’s always a cost and they have always taken something that you’ll never get back- your peace of mind, trust, normalcy, etc. It’s a very true look into the dichotomy of rape culture albeit with a cinematic flair for Hollywood. 

I enjoyed this movie and it made me uncomfortable as a sexual assault survivor, but it also made me process my grief in a way I never have. I would love to enact revenge on the people who hurt me but the whole movie is a lesson in catharsis and how it’s about moving on and living, not being stuck in amber. Cassandra was stuck and obsessed and it held her back and it made me realize I’m holding myself back out of fear and longing for the past. 

I’d give this a solid 8/10 and I’ll definitely be rewatching it in the future. Emerald and Carrey did an amazing job and I look forward to seeing more.

Edit: Since some people are disgusting, let me make it clear- I have no sympathy for rapists, and they do not deserve to move on. They should have to live with the shame of what they did to another human every single goddamn day. VICTIMS should be able to move on and be free. Perpetrators of sexual assault KNOW BETTER and should have to live with their choices while victims should be advocated for and help move past their trauma.

gjfpwno,"Wow absolutely loved this. Where to start? 

First, I loved the (I assume) deliberate casting of likeable comedians as the rapists. Casting Sam Richardson, who plays the only kind person on Veep, Max Greenfield who is beloved from New Girl, and the others is such a wonderful nice twist. A constant reminder that rapists don't look like letchers, they look like your friends. They are ""nice""

I also loved Cassie giving everyone a chance to attempt a road to forgiveness. All of these men make excuses and deny. By doing so they are not only gaslighting and harming the victim, they are warping their own soul. The men were quite literally detached from reality in this film. Alfred Molina existing to show that you can *always* try to make the world better. That if you have done things you regret your guilt is only useful if it manifests as action. Parading it around as something that you hold with you is irrelevant. You have to do better moving forward and be an active ally. 

The idea of not remembering your crimes isn't relevant. It was still something that the characters did. And by denying and excusing they lost the ability to redeem themselves.",kkbeha
gjune9l,Carey Mulligan's hair ... that is all.,kkbeha
gnu5zxy,"I’ve seen a lot of mixed reviews of this film from survivors of assault, and while negative reactions are definitely valid, I’d like to share my perspective as a survivor. The ending of this film was as perfect as possible in my opinion. The film had essentially two audiences, the flawed society it attempts to call out and the survivors who are seeking catharsis. 

If Cassie moved on and was able to get her life back in place it would’ve been a positive ending for society, but it would’ve been letting the society it is critiquing off the hook far too easily. It would allow for said society to weaponize the story of her success against survivors, telling them that they too need to get over their trauma and move on. 

If Cassie just died and that was the end, it would be a powerful critique, but potentially too triggering to survivors. It would provide the idea that there is no hope for survivors and no hope for justice. It does not matter if this narrative is true or not, because either way it is harming the community it is attempting to serve. 

So why was this ending the closest to perfect? Because it was realistic and a slap in the face to the society it served to critique, but Cassie was also portrayed as a flawed character in her own right, making her death not a symbol that survivors cannot lead productive lives, but instead showing the toll trauma can take on our desire to live. 

I loved this film from the opening scene, but my one complaint while watching was that it presented an unrealistic idea of revenge plots, showing an unarmed woman going home with rapists and leaving unharmed. I like that the movie did not let its viewers get away with this unrealistic notion that women can just stare at cat callers until they become uncomfortable or give snappy one liners to men at no expense. While the Harley Quinn, female action character who gets over abuse with mallet in hand is often empowering, it is not true for most of us. 

One of my favorite scenes in the movie was the long scene of Cassie being murdered. Often films that try and speak on assault end up creating torture porn. Promising young woman was, in my opinion, created with survivors in mind. There was not a single scene depicting sexual assault, the word rape was never even used, yet the impact was there. The murder scene however stood in stark contrast to this. It was not particularly violent or bloody. I would even say it bordered on being awkward, feeling a tad too long. To me, this scene showed the contrast in reaction that we as an audience have to murder vs rape. There were no glamour shots, no montage, and absolutely no question of whether it was an accident or if there was remorse. Murder, just like sexual assault, is not something that just happens. It takes intentional effort on the part of the perpetrator. The scene was long not to relish in the violence as very little was shown, but rather to show how much genuine effort and intention this kind of violence takes. 

This was then followed by the ridiculous reaction on part of Schmidt (I don’t remember the characters name) who instantly came to his defense with no clue as to what even happened. Insisting it was an accident even when Al insinuates it was not. This may have seemed cartoonish to the audience, but i think that was the very point they were trying to make, showing how absurd this behavior is when taken by the friends of rapists by putting the same dialogue into play when discussing murder. Showing how being a bystander to sexual assault is not unlike helping burn the body.

All in all, this movie was extremely helpful for me and I’ve been thinking about it for weeks.",kkbeha

gh1jg2i,"Really enjoyed this movie. I've been seeing trailers for it since probably early this year and it seemed like it would have to walk a fine line and I really think it did. This movie was such a great mix of darkness and comedy while being wildly relevant and even kind of cute. For a first time director who also wrote it I think it's fair to say I'm blown away. 

This movie is, above all else, dark. Things are implied that may be the darkest things in film this year and even though some of them are taken back you still have time in this movie where you don't know how far she's taken it and it's frightening. Carey Mulligan is really amazing here. She is playing the part perfectly to the point where I don't know whether or not to trust her character, not sure if I should root for her or look away. In the end she walks the tight rope of accomplishing her goals without really hurting anyone but herself, but the ride there is absolutely wild. 

It would have been so easy to make this movie about how terrible all men are but it's really a lot more than that, there's a lot of nuance. The ultimate reveal that Burnham was at that party feels like the nail in the coffin as far as how this movie feels about the idea of ""not all men"" but she goes after women too. Her vengeance wasn't necessarily just about gender, it was about who hurt her friend whether it be another friend who ignored her or the woman administrator that didn't believe her or the lawyer who bullier her. 

The lawyer scene was actually so good, the way she had no idea what to even do with a man who actually felt remorse, the way she ended up trusting him most of all with the evidence after she died. This movie really does a great job of taking no prisoners but also not looking at the incident in one way. It wasn't just a group of men, it was the system around them that enabled them to not see and therefore not understand the consequences of their actions. 

Man, I dunno, I had heard this movie was good but I was just so impressed by the style and all of the performances. Even the small roles like the parents or her bar victims were great, no one came off as mustache twirling evil or psychotic, except maybe our protagonist. And it was insane to see her die, but it also made sense. It was almost like she had moved on and learned to be happy with Burnham, but then she was faced with the opportunity to look her friend's rapists in the eye. Almost like she chose truth over ignorance and signed her own death warrant as she did it. 

I think this is an easy 8 or 9/10. The issues talked about in this movie are both very complex and very simple and I was really amazed by how well the movie conveyed both of those ideas while still being really funny and as dark a movie as I have seen in a long time.

As someone who spent her early 20s in the sex work world and a long time after that in hookup culture, it's wild to see the culture replicated exactly onscreen, just as much in her early revenge hookups as in the last act. 

The only thing I object to is that honestly she was much more likely to get seriously hurt than the movie depicted. The snorting coke guy would absolutely have screamed at her at a minimum, not just stood there and took it. The worst thing you can do in a position like that is injure a guy's pride. You are very much disposable to all of them, the Bo types included.

Speaking of: I was very glad that they were clear that Bo was not going to save her life, nor was he going to help police find her body. I'm sure in his mind he did love her. I've seen a lot of men sling that word around when it's easy and only do the white-knight thing when it's just as easy. They won't put their lives on the line for you, though.

Tonally it was wildly all over the place but I think that matches the feeling you can have when you're so angry and done with this shit you just want to burn it all down. And I had no trouble buying that she knew she was going to die when she went into that party.

gji12bv,"Since more people are now discovering the film through streaming, I'd thought I'd repost and collate my original impressions (with minor refinements).

&#x200B;

Promising Young Woman somehow manages to indulge revenge fantasies while also subverting their guilty pleasures.

So while Nina's rape and suicide are avenged by Cassandra, the  film chronicles the self destructive nature of revenge itself.

To  some extent, the film was really about a grief stricken woman trying to  alleviate her own guilt and shame by shaming others into feeling more  (or truly)  responsible - and the avenging angel is invariably punished  by her own righteous anger regardless.

The  fact that the film simultaneously  succeeds as an indictment of rape culture is equally incredible: it was able to call into question  shameful social  norms and attitudes through her own questionable actions.

The  casting againgst type was one of the film's many coups or strategic  manoeuvres - it reinforced the theme of the normalization of rape  culture (or the everyday fact that rapists and rape apologists don't  come with warning signs  and are amongst the people we normally like and  trust).

Carey  Mulligan was astonishing in the role - she conveyed a person  \*already\* dead inside briefly reanimated through vengeful wrath and the (false) promise of renewal.

The movie should be mandatory viewing for all young men and women - if not for their moral education, then as cautionary tale or warning.

At the very least, it should be seen to provoke discussion about the pervasiveness and/or double standards of rape culture, or the way men and women similarly contribute to victim blaming/ slut shaming by offering impunity to the rapists.

I just watched it again with my oldest daughter and her boyfriend, and I  can confirm that it provoked an interesting and complex discussion. I  also took solace from the fact that the film somehow managed to open her 19 year old boyfriend's eyes to his own misogyny.

I'll never forgot my own experience of rape culture as a young man. Many years ago, I was at a public pool and witnessed many other young men and women talking (disparagingly) about another young woman at the pool.

Apparently she got drunk and passed out at a party, and many guys literally lined up to have sex with her in a semi conscious state. She had no idea what happened to her, and only found out afterwards.

Everyone was blaming her for the gang rape - and no one was criticizing the young men who clearly took advantage of a barely conscious woman, or the 'innocent' bystanders (other young men and women) who stood around and let it happen without protest or intervention.",kkbeha
gk911px,"I feel like everyone just skipped over the fact that Jerry's almost immediate reaction was to drag Cassy's body out to the words, and knew exactly how to build a fire that burnt hot enough to make her remains unrecognisable.  It seemed like it was definitely not the first time he'd done that.  Made me wonder if once the media reported on their arrest, if anything else would end up coming out of the woodwork.",kkbeha
gl4tjyv,"One thing I haven't seen mentioned yet, with regards to the question on whether she knowingly walked into her own death. When she is talking to Nina's mom, she cries and says ""I'm sorry I didn't go with her"". On the surface, you can take it to mean that she was sorry she didn't go to the party because then perhaps she could have stopped the assault. But I also believe she means ""go with her"" into death. 

I believe that she has been prepared to die this whole time. She made a choice to give up on her dream of becoming a doctor, have a family, a home, etc. She lives a meager life in order to focus on her revenge activities. I believe she expected that at any point in one of the altercations with these random men she could have been killed, and she was willing to accept that fate.",kkbeha
gnda0mc,"One thing I loved about this movie was the subtle framing of headless women's bodies in camera shots. Then it was capped off with Cassie's head hidden behind the pillow at the cabin scene. As a woman whose body has been objectified many times, those headless shots throughout the movie really spoke to me.

Also loved the weaponization of hyper femininity - bright nails and sweaters, Rococo furnishings, pink carpet. Strong women in movies are almost always stripped of traditionally feminine qualities, they are dudes with boobs.",kkbeha
gwfucaz,"Just finished watching this movie and the writing was great. The dialogue of men saying “she’s asking for it” and “I was just a kid” really eerie. Disgusting how you think Adam Brody’s character really wouldve called a cab but ended up being sleazy.

I love the movie title itself as it’s a play on the phrase “Promising Young Man” as used by the media to describe rap*st Brock Turner.

I guess I’m disappointed that Ryan Cooper ended up being part of that shitty crowd. It would’ve been nice to see her in a healthy relationship.

He doesnt ask any questions, gets no context; Al doesnt even tell him that she tried to kill him. And yet this friend just immediately jumps to reassuring him that he did nothing wrong while despite the dead woman in his bed. Now this could be a writing issue since the movie was rushed - maybe they didnt want to have the Nina conversation again - but i think it goes to show how men dont even ask questions and just immediately support their male friends' violence. Very grim and too real.",kkbeha

Did not expect for the film to go in *that* direction, but I am glad it did. Carey Mulligan and Emerald Fennel were great. Hope they get a bunch of actress/original screenplay/director nominations (and wins!!) for this award season. 

i was pretty mad that they decided to kill her off (at that moment), but the direction the film  went after she died was briliant. Especially when we see the letter she send to the lawyer, all my anger  about her death went away.

Cassie knew, from the first time that she decided to fake drunk, the possibility of her getting seriously hurt (or get killed) is there and always has been. This film is a great, refreshing take on the ""women rape revenge"" trope, and I am happy they ended on a sad, shocking, but also realistic message.

This video interview  that Emerald and Carey did was great. I am not the biggest fan on how this article is written but I recommend watching this video as itself if anyone is confused or didn't like the ending.

edit: This is the kind of movie that stays with you for a long time so I'll add some more stuff after more processing. 

 I'm honestly  surprised the amount of people that thought Ryan is a good guy until he wasn't. The signs were all there in the first ten minutes of his screen time- he was determine to ""get"" Cassie no matter what. (Asks to be friends when she had no interest, drank the spit coffee, purposely brought her to his apartment when cassie clearly wanted to take it very slow, saying he's still friends with the med school people when at that point the audience get a sense that these people were not great.) But people not realizing the truth about Ryan Cooper is what makes the writing of this movie so great. In real life, there are countless guys who consider themselves ""better and nicer"" when they are actively supporting the system/rape culture by not speaking out against it. 

This movie ended on a really bitter sweet note once you process everything. The only time that Cassie uses violence for revenge, the violence was used against her and it's why she was murdered. Cassie achieve her goal of letting the world know who (indireclty) killed Nina, which is suppose to be a happy thing for the audience, but it's also very sad when I think about the reality of the justice system. With shady lawyers and using cassie's ""mental state"" as defence, its extremely likely that the guys will  walk away eventually without the full consequences.",kkbeha

gigmikj,"I just watched the movie last night and it was absolutely jaw droppingly spectacular, i expected it to be good but goddamn this movie subverts your expectations in a lot of ways and even uses casting and the direction to make new connections to sexual assault and rape culture. Just wow. 

I especially was both disgusted and fascinated by the cabin scene and >!cassie’s death!< as it mimicked the >!sexual assault of Nina!< and saw a lot of parallels there and it was also being realistic to what could have actually happened in this situation, as many female
rape revenge films can be pretty unrealistic in that regard.

>!I think it was purposeful to show *trigger warning: sexual assault* a man overpowering a woman like that in such a manner that’s so similar to how men overpower women during sexual assault, which I’m sure many who have been through can attest to, which is foreshadowing from the line “what do you think every woman’s worst nightmare is”!<",kkbeha

It's also a brutally honest film that portrays what real scumbag men and women look like: doctors, lawyers, school supervision...the ""nice guy"" at the bar...this is reality, and I loved how the film went there.

In a way, Cassie was killed by the same man as Nina. I also feel that she was pretty set on this being a suicide mission. Like, I don't think it was just a contingency plan - I think it was practically planned for her to not come back from this (even if it meant killing herself after getting away from the cabin).

The suffocation scene was so upsetting and felt *very much* like a sexual assault scene. I'm not sure to what degree it was intended to come across that way (probably a lot), but it totally did.

It's a totally different thing that he's complicit in Nina's assault. It's hinted at the beginning, too, when Cassie is surprised he's still somewhat close to Al and company. His reputation/career are likely toast since he was at the assault and Cassie has proof. But he could still do a moral thing and publicly expose Al, name the other witnesses, and force them to come clean. His reputation is screwed, but at the very least he can know he did one singular good thing.

But nope! He instantly lashes out at Cassie and calls her a 'fucking failure' to save his ass. Then is doomed anyway. A really good portrayal of ""The 'nice guy' is only slightly less bad than the other guys.""",kkbeha
gvrcabk,"Late to the comments section but one thing I haven’t seen highlighted is how the detective immediately saw this as an open shut case.

Obviously we aren’t given enough info to say if he’s just ‘playing’ Ryan at that point, but from what we *are* given, he’s already decided this is a closed case.

This is another level of misogyny the film addresses, misogyny within the police. Here in the UK a young girl has recently been murdered by an ex after she reported his stalking and breaking into her house in the middle of the night. After multiple times going to the police, they didn’t take the case serious enough and she lost her life. What a tragedy.",kkbeha

Which is a similar vein of thought as the victim blaming that they did all along towards Nina.

It provides Cassie with clear motive to kill Al, and her note detailing where she would be ie the bachelor party implied she expected a confrontation with him and thus I think a lawyer would be able to present a case of self defence for Al (not that I think it was in self defence, but it would be enough to raise doubt), and while he and Joe might still face obstruction charges for burning the body and not coming forward, my experience with the legal system doesn't fill me with confidence Cassie herself will get any real justice.",kkbeha

His reactions when Cassie tells him that she saw the video were not of someone who was genuinely in love with Cassie. Had he been, he would’ve maybe gone with Cassie to the police with the tape and/or maybe accompanied her to the bachelor party or better yet,
Let Cassie be his wedding date and let her ruin it with her presence. Instead he fake cried about how he could lose his job and family’s respect.

I Care a Lot was a confused mess of a movie that seemed angry at men, women, criminal justice, and capitalist America. Casting a wide net there. It just hates people, and the systems created by people. It doesn't stop complaining about either until the credits. It's the kind of movie right wing assholes think feminists want. It was the worst movie I've seen in at least a year. 

Promising Young Woman was surprising, daring, and true to the time we're in now. It rolls around in the dirt of the conversations we've been having for the last 5 years (and longer) - it uses language we've heard casually, or even spoken ourselves. The cast feels so familiar and human - so it's hard to ""other"" their actions. It forces us to reckon with our own motivated reasoning when dealing with cases of assault. Promising Young Woman doesn't absolve the men and women who were bystanders, but it does offer a path of forgiveness toward those who truly engage with what they've done. It doesn't really glorify Cassandra's actions, either. The most heartbreaking line in the movie for me, ""Nina was like a daughter to us, and we miss her. But god have missed you."" Cassandra's lost her best friend, her future, and her self. Every act of spite is... yeah, fun to watch, but pretty tragic. But if Cassandra could let it go, re-enroll, and get her career going again.... well then there would be no accountability. And there has to be accountability, or we'll keep having the same conversations over and over again until the end of time. ""She shouldn't have been drunk."" ""Being accused is the worst thing that could happen to a man."" ""I forgot about that."" Nobody really escapes this movie as an unvarnished hero - the message here is that sexual assault is unacceptable, and it's enabled by *all of us* who are unwilling to hold our **peers** accountable. And it's hard to hold people accountable when they remind us of ourselves. When they look like us. When they're our friends.

-Did Cassie lie to Madison when Madison asked if her friend did anything to her? I took Cassie's denial of anything happening in the hotel room as being exactly what Madison must've done when Nina confronted her about what happened (being too drunk/drugged to remember possibly). Perhaps it's meant to be unclear to the audience. 


-Did Cassie fully prepare to send a hitman after the lawyer in the event he did not have any remorse for his actions? Quite extreme decision compared to Madison/Dean Walker


-Given how much Cassie was ready to forgive the lawyer, would she have done the same for Ryan after confronting him with the video? Of course, the cowardice of Ryan makes it clear that after seeing the video, his main concern is his career and making excuses to absolve himself (I love how the ""we were just kids"" line was used by different people). But I wonder what could've happened if he broke down about being a coward and blocking that memory in his mind to cope with being a silent bystander. Curious to know how those who view Ryan as ""no better than the predators"" would think of him in that scenario. Because I do believe he was an otherwise good person. I've seen nitpicking to his behavior while they were dating, but to me that was the connection he shared with Cassie. Several times he tried asking her if things were ok when she was acting strange, he never persisted on his early advance and was otherwise respectful of her decisions (no touching or kissing in the beginning), and he truly loved her and cared about her. His cowardice shouldn't negate all those things. After she blackmailed him, it's clear Ryan is putting his life first and that's when the real ugly side comes out (calling her a failure) 


-Although shocking and unexpected (to me, at least), Cassie's death did several important things. It displayed how physically overpowered women can be in a vulnerable situation. It broke the illusion that Cassie was always in control of the situation. Another commenter mentioned they thought the red marks in her notebook meant the guy that picked her up that time physically harmed her, and I think the film did a good job by not showing any scenes of Cassie being harmed to set up the surprise turn of events that lead to her death.",kkbeha

Me and my family ended up watching it on Christmas Day. When it was done, my mom wanted to watch a happy, innocent, biblical Christmas cartoon to wash it out of her brain. It was pretty well done, though, imo. Wasn't used to seeing Bo Burnham in a more serious role, but he did a good job.

I really felt feeling like Cassie didn't actually die and they were gonna swerve us or something, but the ending we got was pretty cool as well. Sure it was less satisfying than seeing her hurt all of them but they still got to be captured. I commend any movie that doesn't give us the happy ending all the way.

And she was just so fucking lunatic that I could not be sure, but I wanted to believe she had some sense of morals left. After all, this seemed to be driven by a sense of that in it's quest for justice.

She seemed to understand that there were certain people who permitted things like the to perpetuate, but that they themselves were not the direct cause. I needed to see she had that lucidity and she wasn't just deranged.

I did have a question about the ending. I was expecting her to text the video and ruin Bo Burnham’s life/career on top of getting Al arrested, as she had threaten to do when she had confronted him in his office. Should we assume that will happen too? Considering she provided a copy of the tape to the lawyer?",kkbeha

Like the dude in the truck.  Who the fuck would just sit there as opposed to calling the cops?  And the dudes at the end who burned her body? Come on.  ""Uh, yes officer.  Last night a woman pretended to be a stripper in order to gain access to my party, drugged all of my friends, and lied about her identity in order to get me secluded, at which point she handcuffed me to my bed and attempted to murder me."" Boom.  Scott free.  Roll credits.  

Like it felt like the director originally had the movie just end there, but then realized ""shit that's straight up self defense, better have them act like the biggest fucking morons so they can get arrested at the end.""

I thought she wrote/directed them perfectly.

ghf1v9x,"Finished the movie a while ago but I needed a moment to process it. It was maybe the best one I've seen this year. If anyone (and I've already seen quite a few people) see this as a misandrist movie, they're reaching to the sky really. It's not like the movie made 2 lines between men=bad, women=good. Both Cassie and Madison had major flaws, the dean was straight up bad. Cassie's parents were both pretty neutral, the only actually good person seemed to be Laverne Cox but a) she had like no screentime and b) we don't need to vilify trans people any more than they already are by the society.

In the end, I don't need the movie to hold my hand and show me a good guy, just as I don't need a movie about racism to show me a good white person. It's a movie under 2 hours with a very clear theme of rape culture, I'm aware (and so is every other sane person) that there are good men as well.",kkbeha
gv2vidn,"I finally got around to watching this last night because I really suspect that Mulligan will win the Oscar for it.  I liked it, but I feel like there's something about it that's keeping me from *really* liking it.  

I had gone relatively spoiler free, so I was surprised that this wasn't some sort of straight-up revenge murder spree.  Her just shaming and guilting the guys instead of doing something far worse kind of took away a lot of what should have been a bigger sting.  If these guys are really the douchebags we're told they are, they're not going to take much stock in one woman calling them out.  They're just going to go right back to taking advantage of other women.

Also, I am really afraid to comment too much on this because I haven't really heard or read a lot of opinions on this, but this felt to me as if it was a problematic look at trauma and mental illness.  It came across to me that Cassie had not seen a therapist following the loss of her friend, and she eventually took to some very dangerous ways of trying to salve her own trauma.  The movie took a tone of almost glamorizing it, at least up until the ending scenes at the bachelor party and wedding.  Maybe it became a cautionary tale of what can happen to someone when they become lost in their own methods of combating grief, but most of the movie certainly didnt.

Again, I did like the movie.  It was a new way of looking at a problem that's been discussed a lot the last few years, and the discussion is certainly needed.  Especially in this perspective.  It makes me look at interactions between guys and perspective hookups a bit differently and as a guy, I am probably going to be way more prone to speaking up to other guys about this kind of terrible stuff.

But I just didn't *really* like it.  Mulligan deserves all the hype and I think she also deserves her acting Oscar, but this movie just had so many little issues that kept it from feeling like a true Best Picture nominee to me.",kkbeha

gyf0yxj,"Personally, really enjoyed the movie. The first 30 minutes especially the opening kind of bothered me because it was too in your face with the message but I won’t critique it too hard because I think that was the intention. I felt it would have been more powerful if they made the dialogue more complex, rather than blatant misogynistic rapist dialogue. But again I wouldn’t be surprised that men have said those exact lines verbatim so I’ll let it slide. The rest of the film was very interesting and drew me in particularly the part with the dean. The writing was average, but the acting was SUPERB and took the writing to another level which I think saved a lot of the weaker areas of the films screenplay. I love that they didn’t do a flashback or overtly describe what happened to Nina and why she died. That part is kind of left to the imagination a bit which I respected. I actually really liked that they killed Cassie off and the way they executed it was really good with the humorous exchange between the two guys after and you can gather how the night with Nina must have played out as well. Cassies death had to be done to make the story more realistic. She consumed herself with avenging Nina, it took over her entire life and in the end is what actually took her life. It was unexpected but necessary, so that really saved the film. It doesn’t glamorize revenge which I respect. You always lose something when you seek revenge and most often it’s your own life. I feel like no revenge movie has really ventured in that direction because it isn’t the happy ending America wants. I feel like the writers would have preferred leaving it with the boys getting away with it like they always do but that ending isn’t as marketable. But the ending was again executed as best as it could have been to be a semi happy ending. But I would have preferred they go for the kill (pun intended) and leave the audience furious and have them get away with it. Would have been more powerful but the ending they chose is cute. I’d give it a 7/10. Cinematography and acting was great. Writing was average, the witty dialogue was cute but could have been better (I feel like for a lot of the dialogue exchange between Cassie and the culprits could have been a LOT more spicy and thought provoking but it was just so vanilla and basic, it chose to play safe and for that I give it a C)",kkbeha

I was along for the ride and enjoying the cacophony of tonal shifts but felt so unsure how to feel about it until the reveal of the final revenge in the last scene. I think it stuck the landing. 

While I don’t think it’s a technical masterpiece of any sort the totality of it as this rough-edged pulpy dark romantic comedy thriller satire is like, pretty damn charming with a real serious beating heart of fucked up reality no one wants to ever talk about but made palatable by candy coated dark comedy.

Even after I saw it I wished there had been explicit trigger warnings for survivors. It was already a step above most ‘vigilante revenge’ movies throughout. Then that ending twist really left me feeling shocked, hurt, and in pain. 

You just really put in perspective all of the times you wanted to hurt the person who did what they did. The crazy stunts you imagined, the sick method of retribution. Then you just realize how empty it is. How they tried to make you into a shell, a vessel that could contain their sexual urges. Ignored your promise, your worth. Then what happens after they go to prison? Or you torch out their house? Nothing. The world keeps moving, and no one knows what they lost. 

I personally wonder if it was a loss. Should Cassie have become a doctor? Gone back and helped to fix the culture from within? Or is revenge worth it? Is it worth it to sink down and show your predator your dark side in turn. I honestly don’t like thinking about these questions.",kkbeha

gjzk854,"Love that this movie has been stuck on my mind two days after watching it, feel like a lot of what I'd want to say has been said ITT but I do want to point out one thing I haven't noticed many others comment on.

I think the scene where >!Ryan (Bo Burnham) runs into Cassie (Carey Mulligan) at the bar going home with Sam Richardson!< is a phenomenal bit of subtly foreshadowing how not-good of a guy he actually is. Instead of showing concern that the woman he told he loves is drunkenly going home with some random guy at a sleazy bar in the middle of the night while gratuitously made-up versus the more low-key aesthetic she presents herself with in her normal life, he makes it about himself with his indignation that she shamed and embarrassed him by doing it, ultimately leaving her alone by herself with an angry man after turning it into a confrontation by virtue of, well, confronting them. 

Not to mention seemingly being fine with leaving her alone with this guy while she's (presenting herself as) drunk -- to a certain degree I can understand some anger in the moment if I found myself in a situation like this with my long-time partner, but in the same vein my immediate thoughts would be getting her out of this horribly unsafe situation and then unpacking what happened, rather than just abandoning her to potentially getting hurt and abused while inebriated. There's also the fact that even when they talk at his apartment later when his emotions have subsided, he still makes it about himself and protecting his masculinity from the ""indignity"" of being cheated on, rather than showing any concern for *why she would be acting in such a dangerously out-of-character way in the first place.*

I know a lot of people ITT have made things out of the other pieces foreshadowing his true nature, like calling her a ""fucking bitch"" as a gag while telling her he loves her and trying to pressure her into coming into his apartment on a first date by bringing her there without her knowledge, but more than anything that bar scene is when I really felt it in my stomach that *oh fuck, this is not a good dude.*",kkbeha

ht4r17j,"I think this is a classic example of people confusing an important message and a good film. 

The themes this movie highlights are obviously very important and deserve more frequent discussion. However, that doesnt mean this is a good film. Its pacing is extremely sloppy and you have to massively suspend disbelief for the plot to work. 

My biggest issue is the ending, it's a complete cop out. Either have the main character- who up to this point has been shown to be an extremely intelligent woman, form a much better plan for exacting her revenge. Or you have her die and the men get away with it completely, showing that in reality, woman in these cases often dont see justice and are frequently failed by the system. Instead the movie does a wishy-washy combination of both and it just doesnt work at all. 

Side note- Many people in this thread who criticise this movie are then labelled as being anti-feminist or just not getting it.

A bit conflicted about how it ended though, but the gutsiness of it is super commendable, and I don’t know how else I would’ve wanted it to be wrapped up. The hyper-stylized cinematography helped sell the ending for me because if it had been done too realistically, then logically parts of it wouldn’t hold up. 

Bo Burnham’s charisma and character comes off so likeable which works towards how audiences are supposed to feel. Did he do the commit the act? No. Did it happen a long time ago? Yes. Should he be held accountable? I think that’s up for the viewer to decide as it’s not exactly a black and white issue. Sure it was a long time ago, and he’s by no means directly responsible but as a result, lives were changed forever. Everyone may have changed and moved on since then, but Nina + Cassie never got to in a sense.

In fact all the music choices here were spot on, loved them all.

The reveal that Cassie actually had a moral compass was quite nice. Carey Mulligan is so good in this. Movie tackles some big themes and I thought it handled it all very tastefully. It generated some interesting discussion in our household after.

Ending COMPLETELY took me by surprise. My wife doesn't like graphic things, so I usually read what kind of violence a movie contains at Common Sense Media before watching them. They had a spoiler alert warning and listed that someone gets suffocated by a pillow. Even then, as that scene happened and I was in complete shock, it still took me several seconds to realize ""Oh shit, she's really gonna die here.""

gmjpb6s,"I liked this movie but after reflecting on the ending it does seem like there is a non-zero chance that Al gets off scott free or with very little jail time. 

We already know his family is willing to hire cut throat criminal defence attorneys. If he hadn't burnt the body, I would also argue that he has a really strong case for justified self defense. Al was restrained, his friends were drugged, she definitely has motive (a lawyer could convince the jury that she had muderous intent), and she was wielding a weapon. Given that he was restrained, he didn't have a choice run or temporarily incapacitate her either. As long as he didn't confess to the cops that he knew she was only going to cut Nina's name into him, an outside observer or jury would think he defended himself reasonably. 


Burning the body is definitely a line too far and he might have trouble getting out of that. But it's also not inherently unreasonable behavior given the circumstances. With the right kind of defense lawyer, he might get out easy. The best we can hope for is that Al's friend is as much of a piece of shit as he seems and blabs to the cops.


I guess we can hope that his professional career is ruined, but this movie already taught us that the system doesn't work so why should we expect it to now? In some ways this makes the ending better and worse simultaneously.",kkbeha

I didn't like the message it was sending that she died yet somehow got the - as the end credits music played -  ""last laugh"". It didn't feel like a victory. It felt like at best a hollow victory. I would have much preferred it if she had faked her death and gotten them all arrested. As it was, the ending just didn't connect fully for me and left me feeling just sad and twisted up, rather than jubilant, when they seemed to be getting their comeuppance. Maybe some of this was the point. But I didn't like it. Maybe I'm not meant to like it. But the tone just felt a bit off. You're not getting the last laugh by losing your life to these creeps. Faking her death or getting them arrested some other way would have worked better imo.

I understand that it made the circumstances more dire and got that point across, and for many reasons it was an effective decision, but I feel it would have been more empowering to have her live - and I also didn't find the smiley wink emoticon and ""last laugh"" song at the end fully jived with the severity of the circumstances, I felt it lightened things too much and weakened the message. It was like they were trying to have both endings - tragic and empowering - but they didn't fully mesh. I think they should have just stuck with one of them, preferably the second one.

The visualisasion of all the predators where very on point. The rapists seemed very normal ppl, just like in real life. It made me shivver. What made it a lil too dreamy for me (>!spoiler alert) was when she died. Hollywood didn't seem to bother with the main character getting herself somewhat back together... !<But i understand. Ppl wouldve find the end boring and the movie wouldn't had selled... but imagine the challenge it could've been.

Why does it take meeting/dating Bo Burnham and him name dropping these people for her to spring into action against them ? I get the coincidental timing of Al’s wedding, and the significance of the stripper sabotage plot at his bachelor party, but it irritated me that she’d need the boyfriend to clue her into this.

I think in the end Cassie's death is the only way she can achieved her peace. I think someone mentioned that the theme is about survivor's guilt. Cassie felt guilty throughout her life because she couldn't fix about what happened to Nina, so I think even though she revenged Al and lived, I think she would not achieved her peace and feel fullfilled. So I think, she only see death as the only way for her to be fulfilled.

gu4n22t,"I feel one of this movies greatest strengths is teaching young men on how to not rape, and the clear lines of where consent is and where it isn't. I think we all can agree society does a shitty job teaching men about where the line is in sexual encounters, and what this film does is do an excellent job at showing what may be clearly obvious in a woman's mind, A man can find himself being utterly oblivious as what a jackass he's being. You constantly hear men point out how ""they're a nice guy."" Showing that He's clearly doing mental gymnastics to remain being the protagonist of their own story and justifying their actions. As a man, I feel ashamed to say that I lacked even the slightest inkling of common sense when I was younger and even though I always felt I was respectful of the"" NO MEANS NO"" adage.  I'm ashamed to say that I put women in drunken encounters where I wish I was more receptive to how they might be feeling rather than saying. I'm also ashamed how quickly I was to defend other men who were accused of taking advantage of women or even outright rape, Because I was so sure I KNEW the character of the men they were accusing and how they didn't fit my stereotype of what a rapist was. This movie challenged a lot of my preconceived notions, and I'm very grateful that it did. I just wish this movie was released when I was in High school, and needed these examples of what and what not to do. I feel like if it was I could have been a better friend and a better person.

The whole segment with the dean and daughter I thought was pretty bad.  Good acting from Mulligan/Burnham/Brie with some bad dialogue.  And the ancillary characters like her parents and Al Monroe and his best man were kind of bad I thought.  Alfred Molina was good in his limited screen time as always.

goawwbb,"I saw this movie on the weekend and haven't been able to stop thinking about it. It's interesting to see that a lot of what I liked about it are things other people really disliked. I loved the ambiguity of Cassie's character - sociopathic, stone cold one manipulator one minute and blind-sided grieving trauma victim the next. To me it was so refreshing to see such a multifaceted, complex, and confused woman represented on screen.

I also loved the futility of her mission - to me the point was that as much as Cassie tried to seek revenge or right the wrongs of the past, she's ultimately not fighting against individuals. She's fighting against a culture that dismisses and disbelieves women and protects men at all costs. An incredibly gutwrenching reality but a reality we all must face nonetheless. 

For me one of the most poignant scenes was the scene with the lawyer. Even as he is breaking down and begging for her forgiveness, I was frightened for her safety and cringed as he brought himself physically close to her. Even when she 'gets what she wants' (though what DOES she want?) Cassie must bear that emotional labour.

In addition to the strength of exploring these themes, I also just thought this movie was really fucking well done. Loved the soundtrack, loved the syrupy sweet look and feel contrasted with the darkness and bleakness of the night time scenes. The brutality of Cassie's ultimate demise contrasted with the brightness of the wedding for example. Men and women live in two different worlds at times and I thought the movie did a fantastic job of showing that visually, as well as through the plot. Also loved all the casting but Carey Mulligan in particular did an incredible job of capturing all the facets of Cassie's personality and struggles.",kkbeha

Kind of framing it as if now that she ""finally"" has a boyfriend, she's ""back to normal"" and just needed a man to bring her back to reality. Of course, you can say that it was her decision to throw away the journal, go out with Ryan, enjoy herself, etc. But the timing made it almost undeniably connected.

iroamcd,"there is so much about this film i want to point out- especially how much it says by saying nothing (the moments where the greatest impact it makes on the viewer is by subverting their expectations or by NOT doing what you thought would happen next)- but im still stuck on ryan and cassie's relationship.
the pharmacy scene could have been cassie's happy ending, if somehow the movie had let her overlook that ryan was secretly an abuser. she was happy with him and could have continued to be happy with him; it was a choice between the depressing truth and living in a fantasy land. this is the part that really stuck with me because i think its a reality i live with everyday as do all women. what mistakes and red flags are worth overlooking. how much you are willing to settle for. because in the end, most men do immediately disappoint you, but you dont want to end up alone and dead like cassie did. its an impossible choice yet one that must be made, and this film brings it out to the front of your mind and doesn't let you lie to yourself.
the final blow was when i kept expecting ryan to somehow own up to his mistakes or save cassie by telling the police where she went. maybe he would do something at the wedding? and yet, he never did, even though this was clearly something the movie was gearing you up to expect. in the end, cassie is the one who ends her story and gives herself any dignity at all. she prevented herself from being another nina- nobody else did. its hopeful to see that she could impact her own life this way and write her own story, yet still gave me chills as she truly had noone else besides herself to rely on the way she needed to.

something beyond this that i found interesting that noone else has pointed out is how, atleast for me, i went in expecting a campy horror-ish movie like jennifers body, so i kept expecting cassie to wake up and stab al. it didn't set in that she was truly dead until the timeskip and showed how cassie was in the end just a WOMAN and not a ghost or otherworldly phenomenon. it is inspirational to see that just a person could achieve so much but also depressing that only monstrous women can get their proper revenge, real women do not. al killed her using brute force and being biologically stronger than her and the sad reality is that outside of horror movies women often do not get to enact vengeance. however this makes the true ending hit even harder as she DID manage to achieve what she set out to do. she may have given her whole life for it and deserved better but she achieved her goal and i believe that would have mattered more to her than anything else
i also appreciate her being named cassie as (though probably unintentional) most other cassie characters (skins, euphoria) have a reputation of being weak and pathetic women and have been very impacted by misogyny and turned into sort of female tragedies (though that is another point completely)",kkbeha
goyrs9q,"Really liked this movie; though i wished Cassie had not been killed because she will never get a chance at happiness.  I can easily imagine the Ryan character would get off scot free bc he was a bystander, and the justice system doesn't really care about sexual assault.

This movie has made me not want to trust men.  Only because there are actually a lot more men like Al, Ryan and his cronies in real life than you think.  These men are seemingly perfectly normal, completely innocuous, and amiable on the outside, with clean and successful lives, who are clearly able to flourish in whatever setting they're in.  They prob treat their coworkers well, and are prob super nice to their partners and kids.   
 None of them were the prototypical ""rapist"" pervert that society stereotypes sex criminals to be.  And yet, they're just as bad as your typical dirtbag that hits the bars every night and tries to cop a feel of girls and assumes they're entitled to sex from women.  The doctors in the movie are just  better at being the ""nice guys.""  It truly made me livid and horrified watching them try to shirk responsibility for their actions and just blame women.  The cognitive dissonance was disturbing to watch, but I can easily see how many men would consider themselves the ""good guys"" who would NEVER ever act like these guys did.  I'm not saying every guy is a rapist/murderer, but I can def. imagine a large number of men would be fine as bystanders to their friends raping/assaulting a drunk/unconscious girl at a raucous party bc they don't want to be seen as a mood killer/uncool.  I'm sure many guys have prob witnessed such types of rape in college and did nothing, and may have even laughed along.  Comes with the territory of parties, eh?

The more I think about it the more I like it. I like how it showed how destructive Cassie's life was due to her focus on revenge. That's why the ending works for me personally. Even if she hadn't died, I don't think she would've ever been able to move on after finding out about not just Ryan's involvement, but his refusal to take responsibility for it.

Also, I don't understand people calling this movie misandry. While it does target the men involved in rape culture, it targets the women complicit in it too. And the only person Cassie forgives is the male lawyer, because she sees he's genuinely remorseful. That's why she sends him the information at the end.  Ryan might have been forgiven too had he done the right thing when he had the chance. But he didn't.

grqiec1,"First, any movie that has me still thinking about it when I wake up is a great movie. As a mother of four adult young women it has given me a lot to discuss and think about. The victim blaming is a huge eye opener. I have tended to caution my girls that bad behavior can cause bad things to happen to you, as if being drunk alone in an Uber might cause a sexual assault. I completely reject that notion after watching this film. Do men have to fear being sexually assaulted if they drink themselves into a stupor? NO, sexual assault is completely on the perpertrator!  And some people have complained that the ending was disappointing but I don't see it that way. Yes, Cassie needed help but it seems she rejected that and made it her mission to expose the societal mores that allowed Nina's assult to go unpunished and forgotten to everyone but the victims. I can guarentee that any of the people Cassie subsequently reengaged with from the original assault and its aftermath will now never forget Cassie and Nina til their dying day. And that is certainly a redemption for the victims.

It's a feminist Get Out, not the remake of The Accused. It's meant to be goofy and extreme. The protagonist is meant to go too far, because that's the point. Cassie isn't acting in good faith, she isn't trying to resolve this logically. She is a mentally unstable woman who refuses to accept that the official investigation has been rigged, and will do anything PERSONALLY to see those she deems responsible suffer.

I appreciate the way the film managed to present conversations on sexual assault/consent without being too ham fisted. It felt natural to me, while all the time giving you stuff to think about after the film ended. Yes, there were some flaws, it’s not a perfect film but the pros of it far outweigh any cons, and I haven’t felt this hyped after seeing a film since when I first saw Parasite.

Surely a lock for best screenplay, I can’t think of much competition for Carey Mulligan for actress (maybe Viola Davis in MRBB? I didn’t really like Nomadland, but I’m sure Frances McDormand will be nominated). I want everyone I know to see this film so I can talk about it with people.

gjq2f6h,"(Spoilers)

My take on the ending which seems slightly different than other takes I've read on here:

Cassie went to the bachelor party intending to get murdered and set up the handcuffs to fail.  

If you consider the aftermath, Al would be repeatedly telling a (truthful) story about how he killed Cassie in self defense but, with only Cassie and him being in the room and the fact he burned the body, no one would believe him.  Joe would testify that he found him in the room with the dead girl and only helped him get rid of the body to avoid more serious charges and his other friends would do the same.  


It would mirror Nina and Cassie's experience with the rape with how they were screaming their (true) version of the story and no one would listen and (IMO) be the perfect revenge.


Also, it would be similar to her other revenge plots in the movie where she never directly harmed her target, but only tried to get them to feel as she and Nina did.  Al telling his story with no one listening or believing its truth would accomplish that.


She may have temporarily put this plan on hold when she fell in love with Ryan but, after discovering his involvement as a bystander in the rape, she decided to go through with it.",kkbeha
gkoc8bo,"I think this movie is so smart, carries a ton of resonance and is a MUST-SEE. It gets so much across from the female experience that can't simply be put into words. 

One scene that sticks out to me is when Bo Burnham's character is telling Cassie he loves her. Recall she got flustered and he said jokingly, ""ha ha ha just shut up you stupid bitch"". Now, he says a lot of edgy things jokingly but those two words together, ""stupid bitch"", I remember feeling unsettled hearing them in what was supposed to be a romantic scene. I think someone says that phrase in the beginning of the movie too in a  way that sticks out. Something about it being so engrained into our language.

I truly think she wanted a slash/burn and walk away with queen energy moment. After all, we were robbed of that in [Ms 45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvCg0mRePOM).

Emerald did an incredible job - and the scene with the Dean of the Medical School was sooo perfectly crafted and written.

One of the greatest hurdles to exposing male violence is unravelling the mindset of women who constantly enable it. Emerald illustrated that conundrum perfectly. A first within a feature film narrative. The actress playing The Dean  - wow - how much fun was it to watch her from being smug to terrified. Yassss. Nailed it.

&#x200B;

The ending basically confirms male depravity. How a woman, no matter how ""pink pilled"" ( conscious of the patriarchal matrix she lives in)  she is, no matter how smart and brave she is - will always be defeated by the banality of male nature.

This is why the ending was so chilling. It echoed real life. Male nature is unwavering. Unchanging. They are predatory, entitled and opportunistic.

Cassie went to the party knowing she could potentially die. This was her bravery. It happened way sooner than she expected, however.

It broke my heart as a viewer to know that she died. She was the greatest darn cinematic heroine I had witnessed in my lifetime. Thanks Emerald for creating her.

Also - if you are reading this Emerald - I can't wait to see more of your work. Both as an actor/director/writer. I love you. You have a lifelong fan with me. Stay cool.

1. When Cassie goes home with Jerry (Adam Brody), it's nighttime. Next, we see her walking down the street in the AM with a ""walk of shame"" look. Did she stay the night with Jerry? I'm confused at how she'd stay much longer with someone who was going to rape her after she revealed she wasn't actually drunk.
2. I know things are probably different in the actual situation rather than just sitting on the couch acting like you'd know how to react but I was surprised >!that Cassie didn't just play dead in her final scene. Al kept saying ""stop kicking"" so it seemed like he wanted to stop soon so if she pretended she was dead and stopped kicking, he may have stopped before she actually died. She spent the whole movie tricking guys so I thought for sure she was tricking him by pretending to be dead.!<
3. I don't get why Cassie thought she could >!carve Nina's name into Al's chest when Al's legs weren't tied down.

While they could have made an ending with the message that these crimes often go unpunished, with the men she confronts in the first half of the film, as someone else put it, she lures them in just to say ""bad dog, don't do it again"", which wouldn't really stop men like that so they get off scot free. To be perfectly honest you could remove those scenes and lose nothing from the movie. For this level of inaction to permeate the whole movie leading to the wedding guys to have also gotten away with it would have just had me thinking ""Uh, okay?"" So for her to have outsmarted them all and nailed them, I absolutely loved. And the way it was done had me, for the first time in a long time, with my jaw on the floor. On top of that all the characters (protagonist included) are so one dimensional. With the film and characters so one note, without that final payoff the film just misses the mark. 

A couple of things that made me laugh:

The fedora man running away crying like a 5 year old whose just dropped his ice cream cone.

The best man running away at the wedding.

Alison Brie's ""Do me a favour and don't ever contact me again"". I'm sure this line wasn't meant to be funny but...Cassandra ignored 16 of your calls, you're the one who drove to her house like a stalker (her words).

While I overall liked this movie--I love the plot/ideas/acting/etc.--I thought the writing was atrocious. About fifteen minutes in, after they've hit all the cliche dude-bro statements, I figured, ""OK, they want to make sure they've established how gross men are."" Nope! They kept trotting out every single statement and repeating them over and over again. It is *not* subtle. I genuinely thought ""What are they gonna do next, be so blatantly unsubtle as to have construction workers catcall her?"" AND THEN THEY DID, unironically.

I get it--sometimes, you have to shout and be unsubtle. I actually wasn't upset that it was basically directly looking at the audience, winking, and saying ""men actually say and do this shit."" I get it, and maybe it's needed. But if your intent is to have a ""message"" all that's doing is making people who already agree feel great, and it's going to be lost on the people who need to hear the message. If it's not a ""message"" movie, then it's just shit writing. 

In fact, I would say that the writing in this movie is so shaky that it's ***super*** easy to walk away with the ""wrong"" message. Women can't win unless they die? All men are rapists, so don't trust anyone? I don't believe these things, but I could easily see someone watching this and that being the takeaway. If you're being so unsubtle about it, you could run into some crossed lines. 

She pressed so hard on these cliches absolutely nothing surprised me about this movie. THe moment they had an extended ""I'm finally happy in a relationship"" montage, after making sure that literally every single male was a rapist or rapist enabler, was ""he's going to be a rapist or rapist enabler."" Anyone who was shocked at *any* of the ""twists"" at the end wasn't paying attention.

In fact, the only things that genuinely shocked me were: 1) the dad wasn't a rapist or rapist enabler, being one of the only two male characters that wasn't (the waiter with one line being the other; 2) no one said ""boys will be boys,"" the only cliche statement no one said, and 3) instead of ""Al"" they named him ""Krett Bavanaugh.""

So imagine my absolute fucking shock ar learning that this movie **WON THE OSCAR FOR BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY**.

For fuck's sake.

I wasn't harsh on this movie until I read that. I classified it as  a solid B, B+ movie that just needed some tightening up on the script. To learn that it's considered to be the *best writing of a movie in 2020* drives me, as I said, nuts.",kkbeha

THAT IS THE POINT OF THIS FILM. The end.",kkbeha
gjesh6c,"I was reading some of the comments on this movie, and pretty much half of these people are idiots. It's so obvious to me that these people have never experienced something like this. They have never experienced what it is like to be stuck in time. It seems like nobody could truly understand what it is like unless they have lived through it. I'm so glad everyone loves the me-too movement and likes to comment on that. However it seems insensitive and quite annoying honestly who the hell are you people to say anything about me too. I could feel how the main character just could not move on. I could feel how she was stuck in time like I have been for so many years. What it's like to be so affected by something that all you can think of is just when that person will pay. To be struck down by life and looked down on by your classmates. Like I said most of these comments are from privileged morons. Some people don't have the luxury of not understanding this movie. I guess count yourself thankful",kkbeha

gj2qc9m,"Pretty powerful stuff and no doubt an important message. 

Think it broke down how insidious rape culture is in our society, and does it super well without even saying the word rape throughout the whole film. It made me look inward at myself and things I do or have done that help perpetuate things like this. A lot of the movie felt suffocating in how much it angered me at times. Dudes, we can be so shitty. 

I think it was a little too on the nose at times though? Like it's definitely not subtle at all and I think it hits you over the head a lot with its message. Makes the message feel cheap at times. I also don't buy a lot of the situations that the lead puts herself in because I think if this was real life, she probably wouldn't get away with some of this stuff? I do think thought it brings up some interesting thoughts on revenge, one part cathartic, one part completely self damaging. 

Not super fond of the ending either. Like the VERY ending ending. I liked where it was going at first and then it kind of puts a bit of a bow on everything that just felt a little cheap to me. I think it had an opportunity to just leave us really pissed off and I think that would have aided the message of it. The ending is fine but it had so much potential to be better. 

Carey Mulligan is amazing as always and I think she's one of the most talented actors living. Bo Burnham is great, did I mention I met him once? I met him once. I gave him directions. I met Bo Burnham. Lot of unexpected cameos in this too that were cool.

gkyp92u,"Watched it last night. Really good film. Mulligan was fantastic, as was the rest of the cast (with the possible exception of an over-acting Alfred Molina, but at least he had fun with it).

It wasn't nearly as cartoonish or ""WIMMEN GET REVENGE"" as the trailer made it look, and I appreciate the nuance brought to the primary characters (most particularly Cassie and Ryan). Cassie being emotionally ""stuck"", volatile and embittered and damaging both herself and all of her adult relationships rather than simply being a purehearted spirit of vengeance was a good choice, and Ryan having matured into a genuinely nice person and all around decent human being who was nevertheless too selfish/scared to take responsibility for past actions was more flavor than is usually given to male foils in these narratives. He ends up being a far more realistic, disappointing and depressing analog for real world experiences as a result than a two dimensional mustache twirler would have been. 

Thought it fell on its ass a bit at the ending. I read the director's intention and reasoning behind it, and I understand, but I think it ended up missing the mark. Was the film trying to make a statement about how self-destructive and futile Cassie's efforts were in the face of the larger culture? If so, why end how it did? Was it trying to be a fun revenge flick that ended with a winky face and a ""we got im""? If so, why the previous hour and a half? Why KILL the protagonist? It's tonally all over the map and presents all kinds of unpleasant questions, not least of which would be ""what exactly are you trying to communicate to rape survivors with this"".

In a way reminiscent of Gone Girl, another really excellent film/story with a complex female protagonist (albeit a far less sympathetic one) that completely guffs its ending.",kkbeha
gh5buxz,"I really loved this film for its direction and storyline but also just for how it made me think. I texted a good number of my friends to have them see it as I waited in the restroom for my friend right after the film - and am willing to take anyone to see it myself. It had me really analyzing the idea of good people and good guys, and my experiences in life. Had me on the edge of my seat at times. Made me laugh a lot, cry, gasp. A really enjoyable experience as an audience member and a really moving experience as a woman. 

My main hitches about the movie are mostly performance based. With a lot of the ‘antagonists’ like the men from the bar, Al, Joe, etc I felt their performances dripped too much with irony or like they were super?? idk tounge in cheek? Alison Brie and Bo Burnam did the authenticity best, I think, but even with some lines it felt so obvious that these actors don’t believe in what they’re saying. It makes sense, it’s not how they feel, but it still really felt like it took away from this central idea about how normal this behavior is taken in. This movie is funny, these actors are funny, but I think Bo did the best between balancing humor and reality, and not letting it take away from his character as much as the others.",kkbeha
gmsue7u,"As a man who watched this, I felt it hit home for me too. I spent a lot of my late teenage years and early 20's desperate for love to happen and wonder sometimes if I would have behaved out of line if my desperation were met with opportunity. I'd like to think not, but in that time frame I was just an awkward nerd who never got a second glance and never went out seeking it, so I never ended up in a position to potentially take advantage of a girl until later in life when I had a different perspective on things. Perhaps at different times, on different days when I felt a certain level of confidence, if things fell right I may have been in a position like that and not made a good choice in the moment. Like if I let my fantasy life of being a playboy with women hanging all over me take over my headspace in that moment, maybe I would have had the balls and bad judgement to do something I would regret or have to live with the consequences/memories forever. 

It brings into question (for me) how much of a role desperation and obsession can play in the mindset of someone who would normally be an ""average"" person. Much in the way that the obsession with vengeance ruins Cassie's life. Her intentions are good in her mind, but her obsession is not and despite her making every decision on her own, it feels as if a lot of the extreme risks she takes are just the terrible choices of someone who has been broken by something, not a sane individual. Desperate or obsessed people are always capable of more depravity than someone who is well balanced. That doesn't mean to me that they are inherently awful, and I think there was an acknowledgement of that in this film. We get caught up in things, we get swept away. We get in too deep. We get excited or we get used to a certain thing and then we aren't prepared to deal with it when there is a reckoning to our poor choices or patterns of behavior. Some of us spend our whole lives never being punished for poor choices and continue to make them with no remorse because we've never been made to see the consequences. Even at that point, what about the victims of those poor choices? What about the facilitators of them?

It was a great film, I'll watch it again for sure and probably gain more from it with those re-watches.",kkbeha

Fennel teases us for what seems like an age, is she dead or not?  When is she going to magically reappear.  She doesn't, she's with Nina.

gn8qs3t,"Great film, not going to say I enjoyed it because it is just so damn real and hits close to home for anyone especially women. I did love the detail such as the music and imagery throughout and Kill Bill films being one of my favourite films I love a hit list type of film. This though went a lot deeper for me, yes she targeted people on the list but she didn't actually hurt any of them (1-3) in any serious way.. she made them realise that what they had done was wrong by making them make the same choices but personalised to them instead and see how they chose/thought differently. The death, that shocked me. The length of time they filmed it... the time it would take was just gut-punching. How easily the next day the men could just rationalise it away ""It's not your fault"" just as easy as they can like with raping a woman years ago. Even Ryan said he loved her, but it was easy to lie and say she probably could have hurt herself to protect his own self-interests.

Honestly, I thought the wedding would be the end and there would be no justice. It would have been an honest reflection of all the victims who never got justice.. even if that ending made me want to punch something.

gn8zyya,"Just watched, a good twist take on revenge fantasy movies. Cassie seems like the embodiment of ""A man who desires revenge should dig two graves. "" She was kinda dead person walking already and lived a life that realistically wouldve seen her murdered at some point. Pulling that not-drunk twist on shady rapist men wouldve eventually ended with her being murdered and felt like she was depressed and seeking that outcome as it wouldve fulfilled her cold worldview

Cassie being a lost soul really came to light when she led Alison Bries character to believe she had been raped to ""teach her a lesson""

Ending felt a little rushed with how everything came together and loose strings were all tied up so quick. Little too convenient to burn a body and then leave a pile of ashes, with a necklace, nearby your bachelor party cabin.

I obviously understand the choice to paint the film as a tragedy with Cassie’s death, and show from her contingency plan that she was literally willing to die to avenge Nina.

From the rapist’s loud comedic crying, Schmidt from New Girl literally VAULTING over her body and kissing his friend on the head, the weird fucking wedding with that tambourines and dancing, I just could not get a handle on the tone and that pulled me out of it.

Also for a very minor complaint, >!the writing/blocking for the scene where the lawyer asks for forgiveness kind of came across weird and while that scene was necessary, I think it would have worked a bit better if it was written and directed a bit differently than it was. !<

gixpv92,"I loved it. It is sad that number of movies that are able to describe raw emotions of a common assault is rare. Songs were so befitting. The fact that Cassie was so mature about her emotions although it is clear that she did not get over them is getting more and more admirable when I think about it. Cause that is what happens when you uncover something new about a trauma, you do not react as fast as a viewer would. You truly think about it and when you decide that it is too much for you to let it go, you start to create your plan whether it is revenge or getting help. 

But... Uggghhhh... >!Did she really had to die?! Okay maybe that is to serve to purpose of achieving more realistic movie, I get it. I cannot both appreciate that the movie is realistic and want an optimistic end.!<

One of my main issues that Cassie and Nina were both soo beautiful and soo smart. It is not more tragic when this horrendous thing happens to the most beautiful one or the smartest one. Predators like these guys, they do not usually go for the prettiest ones or the smartest ones, they go for the ""average"" ones so that they are more under the radar.

However, as a twentysomething female, I will say this movie was not perfect. I liked a lot about it, such as the aesthetics and the soundtrack. Laverne Cox's role was such a one-dimensional cardboard figure though, which was pretty disappointing.

First third of the movie was kind of a drag and I was quite confused by the tone and put off by the tell-me-don't show-me style of writing/dialogue.. But by the second third, it seemed to get its footing.

gjm28fs,"Has anyone given any thought to the colour coding in Cassie’s notebook? Jerry was written in black ink. We didn’t see much of his reaction after Cassie revealed that she wasn’t drunk, but he looked shocked. Red ink for the voiceover of the guy who was trying to ply her with vodka and cranberry and sounded like a complete creep. “How old are you? Old enough, am I riiiiiiiight?” And blue ink for Neil who was conciliatory. I think we know that Cassie doesn’t get violent with these guys, so I think the red ink means that the guy didn’t take it as well as the blue or black ink guys. Also the voiceover guy sounds like he wouldn’t have any compunction about backhanding a woman. There’s an awful lot of red in that notebook, so it’s a bit concerning that Cassie goes out week after week and puts herself in harms way. It’s a bit different if you think she’s just scaring these guys and walking out unharmed, but how realistic is that? Probability wise, she likely isn’t getting out of all of those situations unscathed. That gave me an entirely different perspective on Cassie.",kkbeha

gq6bf28,"The question I keep returning to is, was the ending playing out the way it did the backup plan, or the plan itself? The impression I got of the bachelor party sequence is that Cassie has set herself up to be murdered intentionally: she intimidates Al, riles him up, then attacks him so that he has no choice but to fight back, knowing he'll break the novelty cuffs and try to kill her. Just as she's posed as a victim all throughout the movie while being the one really in control, here again she's putting herself in a situation where she appears to be ""asking for it."" I'm convinced that her death was not a consequence of the plan, but was the plan itself.

Incidentally, I was CERTAIN that was going to be the ending to Gone Girl: she comes back, clears her husband's name... then intentionally goads him into killing her while the public eye is still on him.",kkbeha
gz5rch9,"My main critique I think is that maybe the protagonist was a little too difficult to sympathize with. If we weren’t supposed to (and instead just lay witness to the depressing reality of trauma), then I would say it was a bit confusing to have her struggles with making people aware tied to her mental health issues.

As I’m writing this, I can kind of see how difficult writing a movie like this would be. It’s hard to make a point on a nuanced topic, have it be realistic, and also make a perfect movie. It still did a much better job balancing it all than I would’ve ever thought possible. It certainly succeeded making the audience feel strategically uncomfortable.

Having said that, I’m kind of disappointed to see the uniformly positive reception of the movie. Ngl, it kind of feels like the Blind Side winning all the oscars again. Hollywood basically saying “omg well yes ofc such an important point. Take all the awards, so no one suspects a thing.” 

In the end, if all you’re going to do is say everything about the movie rocked, I get the impression you’re too afraid to actually discuss the underlying topic and would rather just nod.",kkbeha

We both did agree that it may have been good to have just one male with some redeeming qualities, a genuinely nice male with no motive or ego. The lawyer (who regretted his role) and her dad (who was being a good dad) didn't really do it for us.  Perhaps it could have shown a man in the club actually try to help her home by putting her in a taxi. While it wasn't the point of the film and it shouldn't have to say ""oh here's an actual nice guy"" we thought it's necessary for balance and could have added to the story. I suppose we're left to assume that does happen though.

It fits into the theme of him being the bad creepy guy all along (not the nice guy we want him to be), in a more subtle way. There were a few moments that stuck out to me - 

1) While they are walking up to his apartment he says something about how he is taller than Cassie so when he is with her/if they do kiss people would think he is with a child which he thinks is funny...like who says that? If a guy ever said that to me I’d be so creeped out.

2) When Ryan professes his love to Cassie, he says something like “Oh, I’m going to buy you a bicycle!” which was jarring to me, like he was getting excited about a stereotypical child activity - seemed like an odd thing to say

3) It ties it all together that he is a pediatric surgeon, working with children every day

I thought the second half was a lot better, because the first half felt a little odd. I felt like some of the characters weren't believable. I know that these types of ""nice guys"" exist, but I felt like they were portrayed too conveniently at times. Bo Burnham felt odd at first too. I just don't buy that he would ever give her a second chance after she bailed on their date and he caught her drunk going home with some other dude, without any explanation. 

Other than that one part, I thought Bo was very realistic to me. I kind of put him in the same boat as Alison Brie in this. They both knew about the incident and were complicit in not doing anything about it, and a big part of it was that at the time it didn't seem like a big deal. Culture has changed fast, definitely for the better. And I can somewhat relate to seeing things in the past that seemed fine, but today are clearly wrong. Nothing as bad as what happened to Nina here, but in high school I thought off this guy who everyone loved who would regularly comment on how hot this girl was and you could clearly see it bothered her. At the time everyone, including myself, kinda laughed it off as ""well, that's just how Victor is."" So the way Bo reacts as ""we were kids, that was so long ago"" resonates with me.

It's stupid to go around pretending to be drunk only to surprise men by being sober once she's alone in a room in bed with them. That's a plan to get killed if the man reacts badly.

It's stupid to kidnap a child and I thought the whole conversation with the dean was stupid. Obviously the dean would have just called the police and gotten her arrested for kidnapping a minor or threatening to kidnap a minor. She wouldn't have gotten this cool gotcha moment.

It's stupid to pay a man to bring her drunk ex-friend to a hotel room. First of all, what were the chances that her ex-friend would drink to the point of getting drunk? That's a silly plot contrivance. Second of all, she had no guarantee that the man she paid wouldn't rape her ex-friend while she was passed out, so she actually put a woman in danger of being raped.

It's stupid to try to go do anything at the bachelor party when she already has the video and she could just use the video to get the rapist convicted and shame everyone involved.

Even the script is stupid because one moment she's able to find out where the dean's daughter goes to school and what she looks like and what band she likes and where she'll be, but then she needs to blackmail someone to get the location of the bachelor party.

The only thing that I thought was realistic was that she got killed at the end. She played with fire trying to enact a stupid revenge by being alone in a room with dangerous men stronger than her and alienating them on purpose. Death is the realistic outcome for this, and I think it gives a nice conclusion that revenge isn't fun and cool, it's stupid and dangerous.",kkbeha

gn5kwzc,"The only thing I disliked was the ending, like the last 5 minutes of the film. 

The cops were ready to arrest the exact guy (even though many people were at the party) and they found the body without questioning anyone. How would they know which guy did it? How did they know exactly where to look for the body? Yes she told people where she was going but a bachelor party is normally the day before a wedding and the time line of the missing person's report happened seemingly right away and the doctor was questioned at the hospital quickly. Was the wedding a week after the party? We aren't told. Wouldn't they question people first, then eventually get led to the body? 

It's unfortunate the ending was flawed in an otherwise fantastic film.",kkbeha
gjkuy8h,"I know this seems completely small and inconsequential but there’s one detail that I can’t stop thinking about. The movie portrays this group of med students as out of control partiers. Alison brie talks about being so drunk all the time and all of the parties, etc etc. The way their med school experience is portrayed seems a lot closer to an undergrad or business school. Med students, in my experience, are constantly stressed and overworked. The coursework is intense and there are tests every single week. And that doesn’t include the clinical rotations they complete, working the same hours as their resident, getting to the hospital for 630am rounds, staying late, etc. Of course people in med school go out and socialize like normal humans but this movie made it seem like it was a 4 year extended spring break. And this detail was such a huge part of the story line. Everyone was partying, everyone was out of control, that’s why this rape happened and it just went with the territory of being in a hard partying crew. If Cassie was in b-school, yes, 100% the story fits and I see it very clearly. But I just can’t wrap my head around this being set in med school. And that’s definitely not saying that all doctors or med students are angels. I think anyone has the capacity for evil regardless of the profession they’ve chosen. But simply from the reality of a medical education...the constant partying storyline just doesn’t ring true.",kkbeha
gr4xtvy,"That last act was crazy, and as others pointed out was what made it from good to great.

grt47ej,"There are so many problems with this movie, many discussed below. But one thing that massively bugs me is why Cassie’s character would ever give Ryan a second chance?

gjp2i62,"[Lots of spoilers]

As an assault survivor, what this movie turned out to be, especially after the trailer, felt like being spat in the face. There was no fucking redemption in the end. No justice. Nina is dead and Cassie is dead. Who the fuck cares if Al and his frat boy buddies got arrested? Cassie is dead. There is nothing more for her. There is no healing, no moving on, no forgiveness, no growth. Some assholes going to prison does not give Cassie her life back. She was murdered by the same person who brutally raped her best friend. Her family won’t even have her body to bury because she was burned to ash. I walked into this movie knowing that so many women will never be able to move on, that trauma can linger for entire lifetimes, that women are so often killed and disposed of by known abusers, by the very people they warned against. Yeah, yeah, she planned for this possibility and the same cop who was ready to sweep her disappearance under the rug took Al away in cuffs. But it’s the same story we already know — the only people who believe us are in on it, no one else will believe us until we’re dead, and even then, it’s not guaranteed. This just reaffirmed that with a kick in the gut. From the moment Cassie died to the end of the movie, all I felt was intense hopelessness.",kkbeha

gkx7s57,"I just watched it. Overall I really liked the tone, production design, soundtrack, casting (especially). The writing felt a bit bland, it felt like they told instead of showed. But I think it would've risked missing the point by skirting around the issue at hand. And maybe that's part of why this movie was great, is that it overtly called out the classic lines and defenses people give, and exposed how dumb they are.

I think it felt self righteous, but I'm glad they went all the way with Cassie with giving her what she wanted despite her downfall and didn't try and give her a redemption arc.",kkbeha
gr4ju84,There are so many unlikely scenarios in this movie.,kkbeha
gjn4b67,"Just watched the film and here are my current thoughts:

1. The  movie isn't subtle at all. All the men Cassie goes home with are so on  the nose creepy. Well actually, the first dude was kinda nice but since I  saw the trailer I knew where this was headed. Dean Walker was so  obviously wrong. Madison and her flippancy too. I don't believe this  makes it unrealistic, but being so obvious about how shitty these people  were/are makes it easy to empathize with Cassie and her revenge. Nina was so brutally assaulted that it puts no doubt in your mind about who  is in the wrong. It's just that in real life, there's a lot of  situations that aren't so clear cut. The boyfriend who pressures his  girlfriend into sending nudes and she does just to shut him up, the  older man who pursues younger women ignoring the power imbalance, the  girl who froze during sex and the guy keeps going assuming she's okay  with it even though she never explicitly said yes. The movie doesn't deal with the grey areas of real life and I almost wonder if it does  this in an attempt to get male viewers to understand what it's like. To  prevent them from dismissing valid concerns about male characters'  behavior. Cassie forgives one male character, the lawyer, proving ""not  all men."" The film shows how women are complicit in rape culture too, so  the movie isn't an ""all men are bad"" type film. I don't think this lack  of subtlety detracts from the movie experience, but to me the message  was really obvious. For example, I wasn't shocked by Ryan's betrayal.  Was anyone? Yet it was still fun to watch Cassie get revenge on them.
2. I also thought it was interesting how perfectly palatable her revenge  was. Don't get me wrong I don't doubt the effectiveness of it, but there  was no violence and I feel like it's another way to force people to  identify with Cassie. She never really puts anyone in harms way (aside  from Al) and so viewers can't make the ""what happened to Nina was wrong  but that's no excuse for violence"" claim. What Cassie is doing is  self-destructive no doubt, but she never veers off the cold focused  femme fatale archetype. She never does anything that makes us  uncomfortable (>!the Madison thing turned out to not be true and with Al  she knew he would kill her!<). We don't see the true depth of her pain and  grief or how her choices are affecting her. Everything she does puts  herself in harms way and even Al's punishment/consequences only happens  with her sacrificing herself. She's the perfect ""assassin"", beautiful,  few character flaws aside from wanting revenge, motivated by pure love  and anger for her best friend (who is also not particularly fleshed  out). It's almost like if she wasn't perfect, then she's not worthy of  being sympathized. Just like if a female survivor isn't perfect (ie no  drinking, no drugs, no ""revealing"" clothes, not out late, etc), then her  pain isn't worth listening to.  >!Cassie had to die to get justice and it rings hollow though I guess that was the point. !<
3. I liked the shift in tone the  morning after the bachelor party. >!That was when I realized that Cassie  was dead. And it was a complete fucking joke. Joe's reaction to seeing  her body made me want to laugh, it was so comical like I was watching  The Hangover or something. She was nothing to them. I also liked how the  scene in which Al killed her was shot. It didn't dramatize or  sensationalize. It was a long unnerving scene and yet it looks so...  easy almost? How easily took away her life. We don't even see Cassie's  face afterward. !<
4. The rom-com Ryan-Cassie montage made me kinda  cringe cause it just looked so ridiculous in the grand scheme of  things. It's so shallow and empty. I think it was supposed to make us  trust Ryan more, but by the end, it only reinforces how he didn't know  anything about her. How meaningless his ""love"" was.
5. I think  the movie does have elements of 'white feminism.' However, that's not  something that bothered me cause I had a feeling it would going in. I  still enjoyed the movie, despite its narrow scope.
6. I love that creepy violin rendition of toxic.
7. I loved when Cassie was intimidating people. From the way she stared  down the construction workers, to her smashing that guy's tail and  headlights. Showed how so many of the shitty men were all just talk.  They intimidate her because they think she'll cower and when she doesn't  that unnerves them.
8. I didn't buy Bo Burnham as a doctor. He  was still good, but every time he had on a lab coat or scrubs it just  felt a bit awkward.
9. This movie reminded me of the book The Female of the Species which has a similar plot except there's a lot more violence.

Overall I liked the movie, but it feels kinda surface level which is okay. I still enjoyed it.",kkbeha

gl4a4me,"Great movie. It's a bit draggy at first but made up halfway through the movie. Bo Burnham character seems suspicious at the start, so it's expected he also had something to do with Nina incident. Felt odd when cassie was killed during third act, but luckily she had prepared for the worst. However, the wedding scene & scheduled message thing i think was a little bit unrealistic when the messages came coincidentally at the same time as the police came to arrest Al Monroe.

This movie made me think If you were in Ryan/Al situation, what would you do? Do you sacrifice your career/life or come clean and face the consequences?

Overall, I think it's a good movie and perfect to raise awareness on rape culture, esp on younger audience since no gore nudity/violence shown (the most violent scene is when Al killed Cassie; which is forgivable imo).",kkbeha
gr735dn,"Without exaggeration, I think this might be the best movie I've ever seen.

Promising Young Woman is a triumph of style and substance. The most tense thriller I've ever watched while also having the most interesting and nuanced take on rape culture that I've ever heard. A take that, as a victim, really resonated with me. The acting is pitch perfect in every role. If Emerald Fennel proves to not be a one hit wonder after this, she will become my favorite director of all time. All of this is to say....if fucking Nomadland wins Best Picture over this movie, I'm going to burn the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to the ground.",kkbeha

gs76z2z,"This movie needed to exist. I’m glad I watched it, and I’m glad lots of people are watching it. It is a very uncomfortable truth that modern hookup culture still has a disgusting prevalence of dubious to nonexistent consent. And that means your friends. People you like hanging out with can be rapists, and it’s gonna be very hard for you to abandon them if they’re caught. Most people don’t do that. And the casting  definitely supports that message.

That said, this movie has an awful habit of telling instead of showing. Themestating is bad and I don’t know why screenwriters that do it keep getting nominated for Oscars. I had the same problem with Three Billboards and Beale Street. 

You guys know we’re not supposed to like Cassie, right? She’s like Jigsaw. Yes, her motive is revenge and her victims are culpable, but she’s still the horror villain. And she gets a horror movie ending to go with it. She’s about to cut him open when her victim kills her and seemingly defeats her for good, only for her to come back and get him with one last scare. The difference is that we’ve been following her, not him. 

I’m usually sick of the vilification of defense attorneys in movies. This one, thankfully, does not dump on a man for merely doing his job. This guy’s actually guilty of malpractice. It’s kind on insulting that she lets him off easy, actually. He was way worse than the dean.

The dean is definitely the least culpable person she talks to, and the closest the film gets to the legitimate conflict between stopping assault and the rights of the defendant. Another very uncomfortable truth that the movie doesn’t actually engage with is the fact that sexual assault at the best of times is hard to prove and that any fair system will result in a depressing number of false acquittals, and that cannot be avoided.

The point where the scenario goes way too far is when the video shows up. I know they had to have Cassie find out that Ryan was there somehow, but a picture wouldn’t do the trick? It honestly destroys the whole premise of rape culture as a cruel sport for guys who think they’re being nice. When did they pass around this video? Was it before or after the investigation? If before, why didn’t Madison believe Nina? They were sharing this video with people who weren’t there and wouldn’t be implicated, but they all went to bat for Al anyway and hid it, for some unexplained reason. If after, why the hell would they share that and potentially risk it getting out? They act like it was treated as no big deal, but after the accusation and legal wrangling I can’t possibly buy that nobody who saw it took it seriously. There has to be plausible deniability for this scenario to work, and the video removes that. Madison is no longer a character resembling someone I’ve met in real life.

Did anyone watching this movie ever really feel like this was Ohio? Just slap an Ohio license plate on the car and point the camera away from the palm trees. That’s all they did. There are films for which this wouldn’t matter, but the setup does depend on location. They probably chose Ohio to give it a middle America hometown feel. She’s apparently been going out to bars and meeting hundreds of single men who are just now comparing stories and recognizing her, so it’s probably the suburbs of a major city. They won’t commit to which one with any sports logos or landmarks, it’s just Ohio. In the summer, when everyplace in the US looks the same.

It’s powerful that we don’t ever see Nina. She was silenced. We don’t hear her voice, we hear Cassie’s. And that’s no substitute. It can never be made right. The wrong that was done lingers eternal.",kkbeha
gueod5x,"Watching this movie felt like reading a twitter thread. Subtlety was not it's strong suit.

h1vrwc2,"With absolutely all respect due to the movie's concept/message, I have to agree the writing was atrocious. The scenes felt rushed, the direction felt too over the top pushed for the actors to behave like assholes with the intention of making a single-sided point. Most of the characters were exaggeratedly portrayed (mind Bo Burnham) and as MUCH as I wanted to, so, so badly, I couldn't find myself sympathizing with Cassie hardly at all.  


I can see her actions as a character being a bit all over the place; it's a difficult fucking topic and what can you do when the system/those in it are essentially groomed to believe in the morality of men and not women in these types of situations? But at the same time, very little room for open discussions or bringing up the more complicated, multi-faceted sides that are hardly spoken about. (This is not to say all situations, there are of course, disgusting situations as potrayed in the movie.)  


I think we're aiming for the right concepts here, but kind of grasping at straws with how to portray it. If I'm being honest, I don't think this movie deserved to be in the 90's with Rotten Tomatoes despite its phenomenal casting. It felt too over the top/exaggerated (in some respects) and was just a bit too on the nose for tackling a subject that deserves to be treated with imo more care and finesse.

gjokpxu,"I was looking forward to this movie, and very much wanted to like it. I ended up liking it, but mostly because of shocking, yet satisfying ending, and main character. The film itself could be much better if it was more subtle, and I think it could have gone much further.

After I watched a trailer for the first time, I couldn't wait to see what exactly she does with the guys she pretends to be drunk with. Turns out she just shows she is sober, and they all freak out. The reaction from McLovin was especially unrealistic. I don't know what more could the writer do with it, but I'm not a writer. Maybe she could have a website, or a list of predatory men she shared with other women? Collecting information on them? I'm not sure. This was such a good idea — her having this double life, practically risking herself to expose rape culture and male hypocrisy, but it turned out to be nothing really.

Some of the scenes feel out of place, like the lawyer, whose acting I found to be the worst. Only in the end I understood he was placed there only to explain her final revenge, but I think movie could either do without him, or do better.

Small revenges on women (her ex friend, and the dean) were also pretty satisfying and did very well in exposing rape culture, but again, I wish there was more connective tissue. At the end, those scenes didn't really lead anywhere.

But I also loved a lot of things. Ending was completely unexpected, and came crushing at me just as I was thinking sceptically about her plan. What if the bachelor party didn't take place in the woods? What if there wasn't a separate bedroom? What if that bedroom didn't have metal bars? I was annoyed by the conveniences, when suddenly the movie showed me how her plan failed (even though her backup plan succeeded). I loved that the movie had balls to kill the main character, but I wish we'd seen more self-destruction throughout the movie. The main character was portrayed as depressed but it was kinda tame. Simply meeting a boyfriend shouldn't be enough to take her out of that spiral. Because this should have been the main point of the movie — to show how rape affects the victim, or in this case, a victim's friend. Social commentary is quite obvious, and it would shine too. I think we could see more of Cassie's pain, depression and self-harm by proxy.

I loved the main character, I already mentioned that I wish her self-destruction was portrayed better and had more light shed on it, but I think the script and Carey Mulligan did a great job about her. I also loved her chemistry with Bo Burnham, I believed their romance, and I loved how his character turned out to be the average ""good guy"" bystander who contributes to rape culture by doing nothing about it.

The social commentary is on point, but I wish it was more subtle and smart. At times, it felt like twox reddit posts, and I'm a sucker for those types of posts, but it's a movie, so it should be held to higher writing standards.

I really loved how it was filmed, and the music choices. The cinematography was very stylized and I think it fit the theme and mood of the movie. 

I almost wish the revenge wasn't about Cassie's friend, but Cassie herself? I'm not sure, but since we never see her friend, and hear about her from Cassie, the movie unintentionally does what Cassie was devastated about — made Nina just a victim, faceless and characterless. The shame and horror of being in her place were just hinted at, and at some point I realized that Cassie wasn't the one raped (I mistakenly assumed both of them were). I think it added unnecessary confusion. At the same time, I don't like the trope ""a woman's character is motivated by her sexual assault"" so I get why Nina was the victim of rape, not Cassie. But it made Cassie's character a bit less relatable. They could also do more with the ""rape victim's friend"" narrative. She could have been kicked out of school for trying to bring up the old case where a dude was acquitted, they could depict the outcome of being falsely accused of being a false accuser of rape. Maybe, her friend wanted to let go, while Cassie wanted to fight. This could have been a smarter choice than Cassie quitting to take care of a rape victim who killed herself.

Basically, I thought it was a very good, dark and fun movie, and I'm happy it exists. I just with it would be more daring and bold throughout, not just at the end. I think it explored the themes very well, but it still missed some opportunities. The character was brilliant, and the ending was everything I didn't know I wanted from a movie.",kkbeha
ghc6mjp,My goodness! I couldn’t wait to watch this movie and now that I have- I feel like it’s been buried under my skin. Left me veryyy uncomfortable and veryyy sad for that ending. That ending boy! I kinda had an idea that that was where it was heading ‘cause of the trailers showing those dogs sniffing the dirt/ground. But it still knocked me on my ass when they showed that very uncomfortably longgg scene. Made me wince and close my eyes I was so uncomfortable. But I think it did its job. It was effective and though I would have wanted the “alternative/original” end that Fennell wrote- I am glad she went with the final ending we see now. So now I feel like I have a bad after taste in my mouth after watching this movie but I think it was meant to give that effect to the viewers. They would have copped out if they went with the typical Hollywood happy ending of Cassie getting her revenge of tattooing Nina’s name on Al’s chest and cutting his d*ck off and her leaving the cabin smoking a cigarette but it’s not real life. Just look at the Brock Turner case and Brett Cavanaugh who now sits as a Supreme Court Justice judge and those are the examples of why this movie went there with its ending. It’s real life- gritty and sad. Wish we didn’t live in this type of world but sadly we do.,kkbeha
gkb932u,"Something I appreciated was that the film had a good balance of complicit males and females. While there was plenty of dispicable male behavior, this wasn’t a “men are trash” affair. I’m glad it wasn’t- that narrative is neither true nor helpful and women can be just as harmful and hurtful in these scenarios as we have often seen in the sad but true real life cases of sexual assaults where victims could not consent. Just very nuanced and intelligent film.",kkbeha
gl53kuj,"I know that I'm in the extreme minority for the following opinion and that's understandable - I understand why people love this movie, I really wanted to love this movie. I love the ideas in this movie, I love the ambition but it just did not fall into place for me at all and I was left feeling extremely disappointed. This film makes me think of movies like Hard Candy (old, fantastic indie movie with sort of similar premise), and Lady Vengeance (part of the vengeance trilogy along with Old Boy, LV is my favorite in the trilogy), which I believe were far more immersive, gut-punching, nuanced and interesting takes on abuse and revenge than this movie was. 

I did not feel like nearly any of the dialogue felt 'realistic' at all, most of the story beats didn't really make sense to me from a 'would human beings really act/talk like this?' sort of way (I mainly think it bothers me because it seemed to want to be artsy/or even darkly humorous/absurdist but also wanted to be gritty and realistic - yet it didn't fully commit to either vision, I don't think it blended genres very well...). I did not like how it teased the red tickmarks in her diary but never followed through and showed us what that meant precisely (were they violent encounters where the men ended up abusing her, or did she abuse them, or even kill them? that was left unclear, we only saw the black entries I think - I wouldn't mind if it left these things up for interpretation if it managed to deliver emotionally on anything else).

in the end, I just never felt immersed, I never felt like I was watching real people interact, or a real humanbeing going through her shit. All the characters felt like hollowed-out puppets for the script to perform its ideas upon...ultimately the protagonist never felt 'real' to me (and the subject matter is extremely important to me, and I am very close to someone who has gone through something like Nina did - which is maybe why I have even higher expectations I guess)

I am far more harsh on movies that -could have been- a masterpiece, and I truly think with better editing and a more polished script/dialogue this could have been that good, but that's why I feel so critical now - I just hated the 'gotcha' ending, that reduced the entire thing into feeling too gimmicky and ridiculous... it left me feeling nothing but frustration and irritation. 

>! her death made almost no impact except me going, ""Fucking, really??!!"" to my boyfriend because I was so annoyed at how it played out, I know this sounds petty but even the way her arm was flailing around looked stupid and took me out of the scene, there were an endless amount of directorial choices I didn't understand at all - she could fully move her arm but instead of hitting him with it was just flailing around in random directions...I just hated those scenes, I thought those characters and the dialogue between them were pretty bad. Every moment after her death was like pulling teeth, and went on way too long, I didn't care about anyone...I didn't feel like it put enough weight and meaning into her death and her plan. The texting/winky face from beyond the grave just felt absurd to me and did not make me feel anything emotionally, by being the last part of the movie it seemed to want to make some kind of grand statement but it just fell flat. I don't quite understand what it was trying to communicate because like someone said below, it was tonally all over the place (not that films have to communicate things blatantly/clearly to be good, in some ways I felt like it was too blatantly on the nose and in some ways I feel like it didn't go far enough). sometimes it felt like it was even trying to be a dark comedy but failed on all accounts. I just felt like it wasn't executed well. 

I think I may have just seen way too many independent movies and foreign films that cover these topics in far more creative, impactful ways, and sadly this just wasn't an effectively told story (again, for me, I get that most people experienced differently and I wish my brain could have experienced the movie most of you have seemed to!), though some of the dialogue was decent and thoughtprovoking it was often delivered in such contrived circumstances it just didn't feel as meaningful


**edit** random additional thoughts...the casting in this movie was baffling, again they seemed more concerned with hiring people they liked the 'idea' of (like dorky/nice-seeming men being assholes etc.) without any concern for if the actors actually had chemistry together on screen (not just romantic chemistry). I love Laverne Cox but her character was nearly completely pointless/unmemorable... the scene at he end with the necklace didn't make any sense to me because it wasn't like they knew each other very well and it just didn't land at all for me. The scene with the Dean also felt incredibly contrived, it did a disservice to the actors because the acting seemed so stilted due to the dialogue being so fake...again, I liked the idea of that scene, but so many scenes could easily be torn apart once you start thinking about it...like why would Alison Brie's character keep that video after 10 years or so? I guess there are arguments you can make but they don't make sense to me given the content of her character. or the romantic montage felt..absolutely strange, offputting and did not evoke what I think they were trying to go for. I don't know, I really love everyone they cast when they're involved in other projects...it just kind of seemed glued/taped together haphazardly...also: the mom character was terrible, her crying during Cassie's birthday was the worst fake-crying I've ever seen in a movie of this caliber (though I do love that woman in Best in Show haha)


**additional important note that I wrote after writing my massive movie list below** I want us all to encourage more films like this and I'm glad PYW exists because we need more women directing films like this and telling these stories!! I didn't intend to criticize it so mercilessly in my original mess of a comment (I like to rant sometimes haha), I was just pretty dismayed by some of the choices obviously but I still think it's a worthwhile movie and I love that it started a lot of discussions about these topics. Below in my list of recs I did mention a lot of female directors but I also mentioned some male directors because I truly believe those movies covered some of these topics extremely well or in a way worth watching...there is definitely a dearth of female directors and I love seeing that slowly shift over time - I know that making movies is insanely hard to do and I admire PYW for so much of what it was trying to do, was only saying it didn't land for me personally and that's okay!! just wanted to reiterate for any PYW lovers reading my words that are irked by me haha",kkbeha
glfaphk,"This movie depressed the fuck out of me. Not because it brought anything new to light—I know this subject quite well. 

The need for them to make their audience happy, all loose ends to be tied, feeling like “justice was done” at the literal cost of two women’s lives—what message is this sending?

First of all, this was a delusional ending. All of a sudden police totally understand and are here to save the day? Listen to rape victims, that is not fucking real.

And in order to get justice, she has to die? What message is this? This wasn’t made with victims in mind, it was made to make the audience feel good. To wrap up the subject in pretty outfits and tell the audience that it’s a job well done. It was pure fantasy made for people to pt themselves on the back that the bad guys lost.

If you wanted a John wick style revenge, then make it that, it would benefit people who have experienced rape. If you wanted to make the audience understand, then do it, don’t wrap the ending up in a pretty bow. Leave her dead and with no one getting caught. 

They tried to do both, and failed miserably.

Edit: I do want to add that I have been raped multiple times, so have a specific view. It is not the only view as seen in comments below, but it is A view.",kkbeha
gw246og,"I feel like this film accidentally ends up siding with the ""she was asking for it camp"" through the way it depicts Cassie's attempts to shame predators and sex pests.

As depicted on screen and discussed through dialogue, whenever she reveals herself to be sober, the men never go any further or attempt to harm her in any way. They just let her shame them for a bit and then she departs unharmed.

If we lived in a world where being sober reliably stopped men from going further every time it happened, then it would kind of make sense to intervene in the behavior of women instead of / in addition to the behavior of men. We don't live in that world, but by not depicting this possible outcome the film sort of ends up saying, ""No really though, if you're sober then these predators are pathetic opportunists and you'll be 100% safe.""",kkbeha

gkvaxr4,"I really wanted to like this film, but it didn't hang together cohesively for me. It was like, ""Ah, great ideas, yeah, I can _see_ why it's a critic's darling as it checks off boxes, but I'm still not vibing with it, because of my previous moviegoing experiences."" Most of the male characters seemed like vehicles to drive the plot along, which may be the point, as it made them easier to hate.

However, I felt that Carey Mulligan didn't bring enough (or the _right_ favor of) energy to the role, a criticism I had of her in *The Great Gatsby* (which she later attributed to feeling ""intimdated""). And that she inconsistently delivered dialog in a haggard and weary way with a raspy voice (when she wasn't playing drunk). The mechanics are there, and the music really tries to cover for the holes, but there's a certain _soul_, a higher level I'm just not getting to.

I couldn't help but think that in a parallel universe, there exists a version of PYW with different casting that I'd like more. Curiously, the first thought that came to my mind was Margot Robbie or Samara Weaving (the latter has portrayed a similar ""turn the tables on the patriarchy"" role in *Ready or Not*, albeit more of a horror thriller). I missed that Margot Robbie actually _produced_ PYW and she put her belief in Mulligan... perhaps Robbie would've been too _expected_? But I suppose even Kristen Bell could've been a stunning choice, given what her character goes through in the titular *Veronica Mars* (and note some of the involved cast here). Nonetheless, with those pieces put together, this is a curious read:

> ... producer Margot Robbie was tempted to play the lead role, which went to Carey Mulligan, herself.

giuq6e5,"Seeing the trailer last year, I was really looking forward to this movie. I've loved Carey Mulligan since ""An Education"", I've enjoyed what I've seen from Bo Burnham. The trailer looked edgy, somewhat dark, slightly twisted - it deemed determined to be a movie that got people talking, something that'd be controversial perhaps, and went on to become a cult classic that 30 years from now, hipster film students would have on their top 10 lists....a movie that felt dangerous, raw - a film that'd showcase Carey Mulligan's range, and be a iconic part in her filmography - her ""Boys Don't Cry"", her ""Monster"". In short, I thought it was going to be a solid flick....
...
...
...
...boy was I wrong AF. Below, I've listed my issues with the film, ranging from worse to....slightly less worse.

1. The writing: the characters were so, so horribly thin and flat. The main character? She works in a coffee shop. How do we know this? She tells us, and people come and order coffee. She also cleans it too. Yep. Has a best friend/manager too who she works with who provides comic relief. Oh, and she was a med student - she tells us that too. Her...sorta love interest? He's a doctor - a pediatrician. How do we know that? He says he is, and we see him in a doctor's outfit. Yep.
...
...
...JESUS CHRIST. The characters didn't feel like people at all - they felt like stock characters from any movie. It felt like the writer was like, ""I have this really interesting idea, but I need to make the main character three dimensional? Uh...she'll work in a coffee shop and uh....clean and stuff! And the dude, uh....he'll be a doctor! But like, he needs to be younger and since I don't know all that much about doctors, uh....I'll just make him a kid's doctor - yeah! That seems authentic! What are they called again? Lemme see. I should probably look into how coffee shop workers and doctors act though, just to maybe make it a little less bland....nah - the idea is good enough, people won't care! Not like people are into films with believable characters - ha!"" Goodness. The writing was so, SO amateur - felt like a student script inside of a sophomore-level college class. The brief scene with Molly Shannon felt SO amateurish and cliche - like, the characters speak indirectly, like we don't already know Nina is dead, but nope - apparently that's going to be a HUGE moment later on. The scene happens, Carey Mulligan is at her car, Molly Shannon is at her house and sees her, and....after a time cut, and some giggles between the two and a shared juice box, Molly Shannon asks why she's there....WHY THE HELL WOULDN'T SHE HAVE DONE THAT RIGHT AWAY? Jesus Christ - did a student actually write this? If so, that's forgivable, but when a ton of talent is attached to the project....good God.
Also: according to the writer, when people are in love, all they do is eat and lay down with one another - how lovely. Nothing like a montage of the two main characters doing just and only that and then proclaiming their love for one another. How romantic. 
And the ending: admittedly, Cassie's death was genuinely disturbing with her muffled screams and whatnot, but to follow it with what I suppose is meant to be dark humor as her murderer is comforted by his friend in an overtly-sensitive way....it felt awkward as hell. Then once the ending happens, and her plan is revealed, and the music soars and the bad guys are caught and Bo gets the final text from Cassie that explains she planned everything - it's supposed to be this grand moment, but instead falls flat on its face. Instead of rejoicing with bittersweet tears running down our faces, I was like....""Wait, what?"" (this is all more of a direction thing, but still).  

AND ALSO ALFRED MOLINA HAS BEEN FEELING CONVENIENTLY GUILTY FOR YEARS, WAITING TO BE BEAT UP OR SOMETHING AND FREELY GIVES OUT HIS ADDRESS SO PEOPLE CAN DO JUST THAT - horrible writing.

2. The directing/acting: the cast is talented, no doubt, so I won't blame them, instead I'll blame the director. Cassie going from disturbed and darkly humorous to all of a sudden in love, and hopeful did NOT flow at all and felt like 2 completely different movies. Alfred Molina is usually solid, but in this, he was over acting like a mf - from the moment we see him, we know he's: 1. Disturbed 2. Mournful 3. Reclusive - nothing more, nothing less. That's all he exists to be.  The acting from the would-be male rapists was much, MUCH worse though. Caricatures....it is what it is - guys in real life can be like that, so fuck it if it offends people for being too over-the-top. My problem was all the guys, save for maybe Adam Brody, all went from 1. Wild/aroused 2. Stunned 3. Sad and broken and none of it flowed at all. I'm all for making characters be over the top to make a point of how disgusting the behavior it is, but the way the film handled it....it felt like a fantasy of how a woman WISHES a douchebag would act. The performances just didn't go from emotion to emotion well, especially the last dude, ""Al"" - apologies to the actor, but goddamn - you recall that scene in ""Tropic Thunder"" where Ben Stiller can't make tears happen, so his performance looks shit? The guy playing ""Al"" shows that theory to be true. VERY true. Same for Bo Burnham - solid when playing casual, but too much when trying to show emotion. You can see every inch of him attempting to perform and get the right feeling across, and it didn't feel natural. Plus, while a lot his lines were funny, sometimes it felt like the director let him improv too long and needed to stick to the script (though, seeing as how bad I thought the writing was, maybe him talking too much is the lesser of 2 evils).
 
Molly Shannon was great, however. Alison Brie did what she could with the role - nothing anyone else couldn't have done, but serviceable. Clancy Brown was okay too, and kinda sweet, but idk - that may be my love for Mr. Krabs talking. 

Carey Mulligan was fine, but her performance just seemed too one note. She seemed more than game to get dark and stray away from the normal sorta cute and innocent roles she's known for (save for maybe ""Shame"" or Inside Lleweyn Davis""), but once her character fell in love, it felt like all the other characters she's played and a major regression. As a result, when her character gets dark and serious, it never builds or grows - it just stays the same note it'd been all along. Example: a train starts at 1, goes to 2, but then goes back to 1, then travels up again to 2, never reaching 3 - did the train move forward? Yes. But it didn't go as far as it could have. (Dumb analogy, I know, but hopefully it gets the point across).

3. The soundtrack/the score: I enjoyed the songs (""Stars Are Blind"" is VASTLY underrated and overlooked, so it was great to see it pop up in a film after over a decade), but their placement seemed sorta....unmotivated at times. Kinda reminded me of ""Suicide Squad"" at times - like, these are good songs, yes, but....they just seemed to be there for the sake of making the film sound cool and hip. The SCORE, however....I thought it was kind of awful at times - scenes would be dead silent, then suddenly dramatic af music would start up. The sound mix was pretty bad at times too - ADR seemed very noticeable at times.

4. The cinematography: I really, really dislike the anamorphic craze that's taken over Hollywood. Like, I get it - it looks cinematic right away, but goddamn, a bad movie is still a bad movie. People seem to think that just because something looks to be what's considered ""Cool"" then it automatically equates to a good movie + great cinematography. It doesn't. Yes, the main character is out of frame because she's unstable, YES she's now framed perfectly because she's in love - good for you. You just passed your first pop quiz for online film school.

5. The....budget? The sets seemed really cheap to me - a bar with only 8 people? Exterior bar shots with only 2 or 3 bystanders? It all felt strangely low-budget - like REALLY low-budget. Was this film actually a thesis film that happened to have some solid actors? It felt like it.


So all in all....I really think this movie could've been so much better. When pieces of shit like Brock Turner are around, you'd really hope a film that deals with similar issues would hit the nail right on the head, and really bring attention to the issues of date rape, taking advantage of females, women not being believed. This film will still undoubtedly being attention to the issues, but damn....a much, much better film could've done the job, instead we got ""Promising Young Woman""....damn.",kkbeha
gihykrz,"The movie suffered from the two beginnings in the same way that WW84 did. The scene with Mclovin was over kill because we already saw what she does in the beginning of the movie. And this movie absolutely could have used a few minutes shortened from it. 

I also thought everybody was so over the top with how bad they were. ""There is a video of a girl being raped, we all just laughed at it"" What? We already understood that this person did the wrong thing, but who (especially another female) is going to laugh at a video of a girl passed out being raped with a bunch of dudes in the room. Her not doing anything with the video would have gone along with her character but her ""laughing"" about it almost ruins what she is representing. She was laughing at the rape instead of just writing it off of a drunk girl.

giryf27,"I kinda liked it and Carey Mulligan was fantastic, but I'm conflicted about that ending. While it would've been too predictable if Cassie had just killed the rapist, her death still felt gratuitous. Did she really have to be a martyr to bring justice to her friend? Did she really ""win"" in the end, since the rapist could still claim he killed her in self defense? Ok, he'll still be sentenced because of the video, but the same could've happened if she didn't die. And why could someone who always escaped from dangerous situations be so sure something bad could happen?",kkbeha
gijcs83,"Well... it’s exactly what you think it is with a few uniquely interesting detours along the way.  I want to heavily criticize the excessive use of caricatures like something out of a “woke” Gillette commercial but we don’t really have a plot without them. 

Even though this movie is the inverse of “men writing women”, it’s a good movie with a solid acting performance from Carey Mulligan.",kkbeha
gmtqcfi,"The early reviews promised a black comedy/thriller ""with teeth,"" but I felt the movie was largely toothless. So she pretends to be drunk and then gives men a nice, stern talking to? The very first man ensnared in her trap literally put his fingers inside her. Is that not rape? So all those tally marks in her notebook don't denote rapists put in their place by the criminal justice system but so-called ""nice guys"" who got a verbal tongue lashing?

Every single scene save for the bachelor party was a big nothing burger. And Bo Burnham's performance was awful. The way he switches from rom-com dreamboat to sneering asshole requires a huge suspension of disbelief bordering on fantasy. Yet the movie attempts to stay so grounded in reality in the way it tries to keep Cassie's actions in a legal gray area (she doesn't kill men, she doesn't actually allow her old college acquaintance to be raped by a sleazebag for hire, she didn't really kidnap the dean's daughter - just drive her to a diner, etc.).

The only real gut punch in the movie is Cassie's death. But, even then, what did she accomplish by throwing her entire life away? Did she really ""get"" Al? All of Ryan's transgressions were in the past, so what impact do Cassie's texts have on him? 

Honestly, I've seen more thinkpieces of how Bo Burnham was used and how subversive the Paris Hilton song is than I have praise for the plot of the movie. Because it's just a safe, comfortable commentary on rape culture that will get millennials talking. It works as a statement piece. But it doesn't work as a movie.",kkbeha
gr65gzj,"Okay, I kinda feel that due to the subject matter my white male opinion doesn't matter, but here we go. 

The movie wasn't great. It was pretty good. I liked the topics it approached, I kinda liked the overall idea of the story, as a premise it has intrigue. Some of the visuals were really nice (watching the phone ringing from under a glass table, the cut from night to day in the cabin, among others). I even liked the ending, >!her dying is something I honestly didn't see coming!< But that's about as far as my positives can go for it. 

The pacing was really really poor. Perhaps it's amplified by the strange tonal shifts throughout the movie, but something felt jarring while watching. It felt like every 20 minutes I was suddenly watching a different movie with the same characters.  

The topic matter, while important, was super heavy handed. There wasn't any sense of subtlety with the way anything was presented and it really didn't let you take the themes in by yourself. 

How this was nominated for best picture is beyond me. I get that it was a low bar year in terms of movie but there were plenty more deserving of the spot than this. Another Round and Kajillionaire are prime examples of better choices. 

To conclude: watching this felt a lot like I Care A Lot. Interesting on the surface, but really bland in presentation.",kkbeha

Cause thats not really how it works and its actually the problem as to why these actual cases are not so straight up as she tries to portray.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                        
I get the revenge plot tho there technically isnt any until really and i mean really late into the movie. Also the video after so much years is still something people have/kept on their phones/storage devices when the chick is dead ? For what damn reason other than to trigger the plot to continue ? This is one big pile of morale bullshit without really knowing the circumstances and what actually really happend. Was it really that one sided and the chick Nina had no part in this being her fault ? Not at all ?                                                                                  
                                                                                                                        
oooh plot twist. The guy she is dating was there when it happend. Then send the video. Absolutely nothing would happend. Its not like being on a video from a party with bunch of drunk people from decade+ ago is a criminal offense right. Lets also make the AL dude a murderer while at it when a crazy chick tried to carve her dead friend name on him because he needs to be one to make a sense out of this mess, thats the only outcome in which this ending would actually work, everyone talks about that ending, it wasnt shocking at all, it was the only ending that would pass tho Its so basic, stretched out and mainly boring that iam amazed someone felt like its 8-9-10/10 movie.

gkem2aw,"Did anyone feel like the movie ALMOST got to a place of awesome, but not quite? I was SO excited for this movie. And it was pretty good, but I felt like the entire thing was revealed in the trailer. There were some glaringly convenient pieces – how exactly did she know she’d be able to find the Dean’s daughter at that exact moment, for instance? Why, after years of messing around with guys who tried to rape her, did she suddenly start moving on to bigger targets, like the friend and the Dean (Al is explainable, she thought he lived abroad)? What exactly does she accomplish by pretending to be drunk and then telling guys off – how will that change their behavior toward other women in the future? If she recorded their encounters that would make sense, but she didn’t. She just...gave them a talk and left? The idea is better on paper than seeing it play out on screen.

I don’t know. Even though it handled an important topic really well (I particularly liked how it touched on women examining their own internalized misogyny), it didn’t quite click for me how I hoped. Even stylistically it felt half-baked – we had a couple lovely, pastel framing shots (like her and Ryan kissing), but too few to make it feel like it was cohesive throughout the film.",kkbeha

gnfim7f,"I really liked the movie up until the ending, not only it felt very rushed it also felt kind of like a let down? I'll spoil it just in case someone hasn't seen it yet/finished it: >!the fact that Cassie gets killed by Nina's rapist -you could also argue he's also her murderer metaphorically speaking- just feels like a slap in the face, like not matter how hard you try you'll never take him down. Sure, he does get arrested and they do find her body/ashes but that still doesn't guarantee he'll go to jail/get convicted for rape and murder. !<  


A lot of people say the ending is realistic but I disagree (since when are police so quick to arrest a rapist and murderer??  Also there really isn't any proof -from the police's POV- of who's>! the killer!<, it could literally be any of the guys at the bachelor party.

go5xq80,"I was really waiting for it and I'm just so disappointed by the last act. I really didn't enjoy the tone of the movie, how it's bordering on dark humor and it's sordid. I do understand what the movie was trying to do and it had so many great ideas but most of them offset by the flaws in the script. 
I just really wish it didn't end like that, it just takes everything away from what it was building up to. Totally misses the mark imo, just sends a not so good message tbh. The fact that in the end, BOTH of the girls didn't get justice while they were living, the fact that the only kind of justice we get is Cassie being a #girlboss to the rapists she set up in the first act, the fact that she ultimately leaves it in the hands of the judiciary system... it's entirely a miss for me. There's just nothing of substance happening in the movie and -that- 2,5mn scene in the last act is just the icing on the cake of a total failure for me.

Directing-wise it was good but again not that great. The structure was messy and the different acts just didn't flow at all, it was very disjointed and yeah it was too long, some scenes just dragged out and I did get bored.

However, this movie ask some big questions of society. Everyone knows sexual assault is wrong, however what would you do if you were in Ryan situation? Ryan is showed to be a nice person but he did nothing in that situation that resulted in Nina being raped. In Ryan mind, he probably thought it was consensual or he was to drunk to understand what was happening. Not defending Ryan for not standing up for Nina.

She doesn’t even kill the would be rapists! Like wtf I’ve seen a bunch of rape revenge fantasy movies and I can’t even begin to explain how lame they would be if they just “scared” the rapists. This movie isn’t even a feminist movie! The only person that gets punished is a woman that the protagonist gets drunk and makes her believe she got raped! Wtf is that. Also Carey Mulligan did not just turn 30. I’m not even sure how anyone can find her character likable beyond feeling sorry that her friend was raped and possibly suicided. She was terrible to her parents who let her live at their house. She’s mean and condescending to everyone including her trans boss. Bo Burnham was the only saving grace in this film. Entertaining if you don’t think diligently about the actual delicate subject. It can’t even be a “girl boss” movie cos she dies at the end!

yes Al is cut by cassie but most of the other guys get off with a good scare. and not even as bad as madison and walker. the guys just get scared that they might face consequences for their actions, but the women thought they/their daughter had been assaulted. there's a huge difference.

The exposition is done so badly.

gr7bwpe,"A feverish female wish-fulfillment fantasy that appears ripped from the mind of the staunchest femcel one can imagine, this film has all the subtlety of a jackhammer as it parades more laughable stereotypes per minute than Chicago on St. Patrick's Day, flittering from one pandering, misandrist caricature to the next in its self-righteous crusade to rape the minds of its audience with the almighty dick of performative wokeness.

Honestly, I'm baffled by the double standard.  If a film depicted every single female character as either a gold-digger, or a cheater, or shallow, or a false-rape-accuser, or hating short men while loving jocks, or ditzy, or overly emotional, or being the stereotypical tumblrina-type with the colorful hair, glasses, and constantly getting triggered over everything, all while the hero-male-protagonist goes around lecturing those women about how ""ackshually, all women are evolutionarily programmed to be branch-swinging whores""....people would *rightfully* deride that film as misogynistic tripe.  

Yet, here we have a film where literally every single male character is a rapist, or a rape apologist, or a predator, or a victim-blamer, or a self-proclaimed ""nice guy"", or complaining about how you can't have business meetings at strip clubs, or saying women are asking for it, or patronizing towards women, or insinuating a woman used sex to get ahead at work, or calling women cunts and bitches at the drop of a hat, or encouraging a bachelor to cheat on his fiancee, or using ""she just regretted it afterwards"" as a bullshit excuse, or being the stereotypical neckbeard-type right down to a dude pointedly wearing a fuckin fedora and childishly complaining that ""You women ruin everything!"".....and no one finds this absurd?  I'm not at all saying the film's motivation to point out aspects of culture that contribute to the subjugation of women is wrong or misguided.  My point is that you can't rely on a valid motivation to justify a bigoted and sexist portrayal of *either* gender.  This is nothing more than sipping-my-Male-Tears-coffee-mug ""feminism"", a misandrist she-wolf in an egalitarian sheep's clothing.

If Elliott Rodger had a vagina, this is the film he'd make.  I was waiting for the credits to name the mods of /r/FemaleDatingStrategy and /r/FragileMaleRedditor as co-writers.  Laughable really is the appropriate word for this film...it's like a reddit comment section come to life.

And regardless of how you feel about all that, the lack of subtlety is ridiculous.  That scene with McLovin...I mean god damn.  ""But I'm a nice guy!"" he says.  The audience: Ok we get it.  ""But I'm a nice guy!"" he says again.  The audience: We get the point being made, thank you.  ""But I'm a nice guy!"" he says again.  The Audience: Jesus christ, really?  And then Carey Mulligan just comes right out and says ""'Nice guys' are often the most dangerous"".  Gee, thank god the writers threw that in, because I had noooo idea what the point of this scene was without her spelling it out.  It wasn't enough for one of the predators to *wear* a fuckin fedora.  We needed Bo and Mulligan to explicitly comment on it afterwards.  Christ...

Moreover, that theme is completely undermined by the fact that all the men in the movie are stereotypical predator douchebags.  If the point is that ""Even men who appear normal, well-adjusted, and kind are capable of these atrocities""....then why the fuck does the film go out of its way to make all the men NOT normal, NOT well-adjusted, and NOT kind?  ***You're not challenging anyone's beliefs when everyone in the audience can agree that these specific men deserved what they got.*** Bo Burnham's character was the only one to actually fit this theme well, but unfortunately the film was so on-the-nose about its message that it was glaringly obvious that Bo was going to turn out to be a dick in some form or fashion.  The message loses its thematic punch when the narrative is utterly predictable.

And this is all beside the point that Mulligan's ""revenge"" is giving a bunch of predators a stern talking to and then relying on the justice system to hold her killer accountable.  L.O.fuckin.L.  The title of the film is literally a reference to a rapist whom the justice system let off with a stern talking to.  If the film actually committed to having the men get away with everything, this would have all been tied up with a nice thematic bow, albeit a disturbingly cynical one.  But the film *doesn't* commit to that.  The ending is straightforwardly intended to portray the protagonist as winning in the end and obtaining justice.  The necessary conclusion is that Mulligan's character spent the entire film exposing the failures of the justice system...but then inexplicably relies on it for justice.  Nonsense.  Again, if there were some indication that Mulligan was being naive in this plan, then it would fit.  But there isn't.  This is the payoff.  This is the protagonist's triumphant moment.  Yeah....

Nevermind the fact that the killer is easily going to get off on self-defense.  Sure, he'll be found guilty of desecrating a corpse and obstruction of justice.  But once the court hears the backstory on Mulligan's intent to avenge Nina, and hears that Mulligan showed up completely out-of-the-blue and uninvited, and hears a dozen witnesses testify that she brought the killer upstairs alone, where he was later found still handcuffed to the bed....yeah....this guy is not getting convicted of murder.  Not a chance.  His life will probably be ruined by the video coming out, which is great, but that could've been accomplished by...ya know...just releasing the video.

But none of this is surprising, since the film doesn't commit to *anything*.  I was actually rather enjoying the fucked up moral ambiguity of Mulligan's psychological abuse and manipulation.  That part was putting a genuinely interesting and unique spin on the rape-revenge genre.  But then we find out...naw...she was just playin yall.  She's not killing or hurting the men who literally try to rape her (at least not on screen...the implication of the red tally marks is just that...a non-committal implication).  She didn't arrange to have Alison Brie assaulted, and the dean's daughter is fine.  ***Because, you know, the best way to shame people for assuming that real rapes were false or exaggerated allegations is to set up a fake rape scenario.***

And then there's the guy waiting outside the lawyer's house, whom Mulligan calls off whatever job he was going to do...which was *what* exactly?  If it stays in character with every single other revenge-target's treatment, the guy was probably just going to go in there and put all of his office supplies in jello or some shit.  That Mulligan.  Such a prankster.

Another thing I initially liked was Mulligan's plan to carve Nina's name all over her rapist's body.  I thought it was brilliant how the film set it up as poetic justice for how Nina had to ""carry around her rapist's name wherever she went"".  Poignant.  Awesome.  But alas, it doesn't happen.  It's not like the film would have had to abandon killing off Mulligan to keep this justice in the end.  He could have killed her *after* she did it.  And it would've made for a hugely satisfying conclusion, watching this asshole have to explain to his fiancee why he has ""Nina"" carved into his forehead on his wedding day.  That certainly would have been a better solution than just having him get arrested, as it avoids the problem of Mulligan's naivety.

Why does the film take such a limp-wristed approach to all of these issues?  Why does it instead simply cling to the coattails of overbearing stereotypes while it forcefully points how ""Rapists are bad, mmkay?"" as if anyone needed a reminder?   Probably because actually making an effort to challenge the preconceived notions of men/society that perpetuate ideas similar to those depicted in the film is much more difficult than what the film ran with.  To change the mind of a bigot, or to at least point out the absurdity of their beliefs, you have to strike at the heart of those beliefs and dismantle them from within.  

Having McLovin say ""I'm a nice guy!"" over and over again only for the protagonist to point out ""Nice guys are often bad too"" doesn't accomplish anything.  It's easy.  It's conclusory.  It's pandering.  It strokes the egos of those who *already accept that message*.  Meanwhile, every guy who *actually behaves like this* is left entirely unaffected.  You haven't even attempted to dismantle the concept you're rightfully criticizing.  It's like when ""Pro-Life"" people just yell over and over that ""Pro-Choice people just want to murder babies!"", while ""Pro-Choice"" people just scream back ""Pro-Life people just want to control women's bodies!""  Congratulations.  You've both made *yourselves* feel much better.  You've done absolutely nothing to further your agenda or policies.  But hey, at least you get to revel in your self-righteous indignation, right?

Also, the filmmakers were most likely afraid to throw some questions and ambiguity onto their hero-protagonist.  Which is the same reason why every single man she encounters is a pathological asshole who deserves whatever treatment he gets.  Same reason why we don't see Alison Brie explicitly confronting Mulligan for traumatizing her.  We don't even know if she *made* the connection *at all*.  All we get is her walking towards the door before melodramatically turning around and saying ""One more thing, don't fucking contact me ever again"".  Oh dear.  Alison, you deserved so much better.  

But after all, we can't have people questioning whether our hero-protagonist was justified.  No no no.  This is the YAS QUEEN SLAY power hour.  Get with the program.",kkbeha

All they have to do is put in a few more cuts and the swastika becomes 4 boxes, 2 on top, 2 on the bottom.

gjf7or7,"Few thoughts...

I was initially disappointed because I thought the trailers were a bit misleading. I went in expecting the movie to be a super campy revenge slasher film, which is was not. However, I did end up liking the direction that they took. As much as I would have liked to watch a rapist pig get his ding dong cut off, the absence of graphic scenes portrays the subject matter more serious. 

At first I was rooting for Ryan, I wanted Cassie to forgive him. He has a lot of redeeming qualities and made an awesome boyfriend - so I was quite disappointed when Cassie wouldn't forgive him. That being said... Ryan calling her a stupid bitch, not telling the police that he knew where she was and not trying to rectify his participation in the video quickly changed my mind. I'm glad the writers put these parts in because it made it clear that Ryan wasn't really that great of a guy. At the end of the day he was another prime example of a white educated male using his privilege to get out of a crime. The romantic in me kind of wishes that Ryan did take responsibility for his actions and go to the police so him and Cassie could have lived happily ever after, but then we wouldn't have had that great ending. 

Lastly, this will probably be an unpopular opinion... but the actress who played Cassie did not look 30 and this bothered me throughout the entire film. At first I thought maybe they purposely cast a 40 something year old to show how her traumatic experience aged her, but I looked it up and the actress actually is close to 30, so I'm not convinced that was their MO. Idk... this just really bothered me because she did not play a convincing 30 year old and it was a bit distracting. Even though she really is close to 30 in real life, her classmates in the film of the same age looked way younger. She looked the same age as the dean IMO.",kkbeha

gjcr4zk,"The movie is in a weird place. It's clearly a product of the #MeToo movement but I don't think it wanted to be a groundbreaking, nuanced take on social justice. I think it wanted to be a schlocky revenge-thriller but with a topical subject. However, our society isn't removed enough from the reckoning of victim-blaming to see the content of this movie as just schlock. I don't think PYM wants to be more than B-movie cheese, it doesn't want to say anything new, it just wants to engage in melodrama. It's just not the right time for it.

I walked out of it trying to figure out what it was trying to say. I was expecting a movie to really make me consider a new viewpoint on the trauma of sexual assault and say something about the zeitgeist of social justice that hadn't been said yet. But when I couldn't figure it out, it hit me that maybe it's not saying anything. It just wanted to be an over-the-top, revenge thriller.

Either the movie needed to come out way into the future or be a sort of post-MeToo commentary. For the latter, I think it needed to be about accepting that justice often doesn't come and talk about moving on in an unfair world and not let reality consume you. I think Bo Burnam's character should have been good but still held some problematic beliefs and Carey Mulligan would have to learn to calmly accept him, open up to him, and not let her rage throw him away for not understanding her right off the bat. In fact, I think that one change would have made it alot better for me. Because then the ending could be a cautionary tale about what happens if you let your trauma completely consume you when there is hope and there is support out there for you. 

I also went into it thinking the crime Mulligan's character was traumatized by was a murder, not a rape. I thought I read a spoiler somewhere but I was wrong. However, I thought it would be interesting to see how the people at the school like the headmaster and Alison Brie would still excuse their lack of action in preventing the crime if it were something as serious as murder. I think it could have highlighted even more the notion of people not wanting to believe women and defend promising young men, even in the face of such a serious crime. In fact, I feel like making it about a rape was too obvious a choice this many years after the MeToo movement. But then again, I'm also probably trying to put too much weight on a movie that's just trying to be simple.",kkbeha
gjjqh61,"I just wanted to know, was the death scene a reference to George Floyd's murder or is it just a coincidence ?

To be honest , the gross denial and hopelessness in that scene felt like a direct reference of that historic moment as well. The little pep talk AL's friend gave also rang true. People are definitely capable of such lying and bending of truth even in the face undeniable evidence(a freaking dead body)

I feel a bit hopeless because I don't know why some people have a burning sense of justice and morality but others don't.

Woman pretends to be drunk to catch out scumbag men who would take advantage of such women. Ooh, what does she do with her victims, maybe she cuts their dicks off and murders them? Nah, she just  calls them on their behaviour and leaves. Oh.


Ooh, she's abducted the deans daughter and put her in danger as revenge for a friend who was sexually assaulted! Maybe this will lead to a powerful moment of danger and dramatic tension. Oh, no she's just waiting in a cafe. Never mind.


Ad nauseum moments like this, in random, barely connected scenes with incredibly slow progression. In between boring conversations serving as exposition dumps, or just conversations like ""hey its been so long since I've seen you. Do you remember so and so? Do you wanna spit in my coffee and then have a boring lunch date? Blah blah blah. ""


You can't just have a feminist movie and have the feminism be enough. That won't carry the movie if its BORING. It wasn't going anywhere and I didn't care what happened to the characters, so eventually I just gave up for my own benefit. And now I've complained at length, at least that's cathartic.

gjjpgk1,"I liked this film, especially the quasi-cameos by various actors famous for other things (e.g., Trudy Campbell, Jock Jeffcoat, Seth Cohen, Schmidt). Almost of all them just killed it. And I liked the bright candy-coloring throughout, such as the coffee shop and the pink living room. That was an interesting choice.

This film is Important but I'm not sure it was good as a film. I do feel like PYM wasted a lot of time with scenes that didn't add up to anything. For example, what was the point of the entire Alison Brie part? She just got Brie drunk and put her in actually pretty serious danger, just to freak her out? The entire will they/won't they romance with that guy, embedding the first 30 minutes of a meet-cute romcom into the film, seemed wasted. Or the scene when she smashed up the truck on the road. I get that it's all part of Cassie's inchoate revenge against everyone who wronged Nina, but it seems like it could have all been dispatched much more quickly.

In a way, I would have liked this film to either get much darker--really challenge the audience--or end in a highly violent Tarantino-like ending. The film had some aspects of a B-movie but couldn't seem to make up its mind as to what it was.",kkbeha

I get the whole symbolism of nothing after the fact can ever make it better and you’ll never understand unless it happens to you, but it legit felt like exploitation cinema taking advantage of what is a very important cause.

Very good performances all around, Mulligan was great, great mix between the humor and being serious, loved the film stylistically just the color and tone of everything, the tape just coming out of nowhere was a bit eeeh, but the reveal there was truly sad.

I was fine with the ending just from a storytelling standpoint, I knew those handcuffs weren't going to work the moment she pulled them out, I feel like the ending was trying to convey something more and just didn't do a great job of it, seeing some of the directors interviews about the movie, it seems like she was really really aiming, I don't know if pretentious is the right word but she comes off that way, the movie itself did not necessarily come off that way though, 7/10 not a bad watch",kkbeha

And the dean making out like it happens all the time. Nina's mom, ""Move on,"" as though a mother could do that or would say that. A fine movie to see, but not close to Oscar-worthy. Hollywood's trying too hard, or I should say this movie could have actually been good in more capable hands.",kkbeha
gm2immy,"I was disappointed they didn't show any of the video (recording from the phone) on the film. Sorry, but I don't care how good an actress Carey Mulligan is, watching her cry while watching the video is not as impactful as seeing such a video as part of the film. Hell, it wouldn't even have to be graphic, it could've been disturbing enough and keep its R rating. The filmmakers must have made a deliberate choice to not show the video, and I think that's a huge disservice to the message.

Edit: I expected the downvotes. Some context, before watching the movie, I read an article that during a pre-screening, two audience members got in a heated altercation about one of the scenes. As I was watching it waiting for a scene intense enough to spark a fight, I expected it would've come from someone being upset the director chose to show the video (gratuitous, as a commenter says below). Then they didn't show it, and I was left scratching my head a little, thinking more on the decision to show or not show the video.",kkbeha
ghvbwpa,"EDIT: After Reading the comments on why people loved it, I guess the fact that their was subversions in the plot and casting? I guess  maybe because I'm 20 years old, who is living in a post Me too world were you cant go to college or online course on sexual harassment, having scene many videos, and a couple of movies and tv shows discuss nice guys and sexual assault,  and the fact that I am naive enough to think  that most men are good at keeping their dicks in their pants, and  ask for consent.This movie seemed too Predictable and saw everything coming.

However As I said, **Please actually respond to comment, if their is somthing I'm missing, or if not getting,  I want to understand why my opinion is wrong,   Dislikes are not helpful for me to understand what im missing**, **and why my criticisms are wrong. I want to understand why pepole like this movie**

Note : I am Cis White Male writing  this, So if there something I missed or not getting  let me know, I want to understand the love for this film, and open to a conversation

This isn't a movie about female empowerment nor does this movie add anything to the conversation on sexual harassment or rape cuilture. This is a strawman film, that feels more like a female exploitation film than a movie promoting feminism.    Everyman was cartoonishly horny and dumb. For example, the 20 year old frat guys not a 30 year men businessmen and how a 30 year business would get a drunk girl.Another is the Mexican consecution cat callers, witch felt forced. Everyone felt like a  one-dimensional character,  from her parents who only wanted her to get married to the boyfriend being so dweeby.

 I espcialy hated the line ""Men only like femisnt in college because their smart and are really good at giving Anal""  As saying that line to me  sends  the sexist message the message to women  that men are monsters who only want to have sex with you. which is false, and a dangerous counter productive  claim to make.

Now all of this would have been fine if the lead character herself was just as much of a “incel”""nice girl"" as the guys she kills are.

Like most “incels”, Cassiy  lives with her parents and refuses to leave. While she has a job,  she doesn't care about it and seems she only has it because her parents wanted her to, not because she had any ambitions in life. She assholes to everyone, even her parents and her boss. She thinks the world revolves around her. And, From  the film frames the romance subplot,  it seems like she hates men because she doesn’t have a boyfriend. She's a loser psycho with mental problems over trauma of seing her friend get rapped, and won't move on/deal with this situation in a reasonable manner.

Now again, I get it's a revenge fantasy, and I'd be fine if the people she was killing were just the rapists and the enablers, but she goes too far to prove her point by kidnapping the 12 year old daughter and putting her in a dangrous siutation just to prove to the collge board that she shouldn't  given the rapist not get punshised or trick her old collge freind into thinking she was raped just to prove that she should have taken  rape of her freind seroiusly. Might had be excusable if the filmmakers played these actions as wrong but, they played them as heroic! She isn't.  Her actions are not justifiable, and come across as her taking things too far.

I think I would have enjoyed this film more if the film was set not 10 yaers after the rape when shes 30 years old, but set it at the medical school when she was in collage.  Have the first 5 -10 minutes be about Cassie’s friendship with Nina, then have a scene be tricked by a nice guy jock type into tricking Nina into going to the party, and Cassie not go because she did not trust the nice guy  jock, and then the next day finds out she had been raped and murdered, and that the school did nothing, which forces her to muder the jocks. Have the tension escalate, then  have Casie change  and grow as a character. That will help us understand her friendship, and be more on her side!

That being said, it’s a well made film with  good cinematography, well paced andI really liked lighting. Carey Mulligan's performance despite hating the character did a good job. 

But overall this film is style over substance and feel it’s only getting praised because it’s talking about a topical issue.

Go watch  9 to 5 or Thelma & Louise, their much better female revenge fantasy films stories, talking about sexual harassment and Rape.",kkbeha

gs1ntlu,"While I get it's a triumph for a portrayal of rape culture that was needed and not really done before, I do question the decision to make Ryan irredeemable despite clearly being a good guy.  Maybe it's a conversation for another movie, but I do think it's an important part of dealing with the reality of rape and abuse.  We have to give people an opportunity to grow and make amends to regain a spot in society, otherwise every mistake could grow into something greater as the person feels they have to deny/defend at all cost or that they have nothing to lose.  That is probably a big reason for why victims aren't believed and why many men ignore the problem or even speak out against ""Me Too"" and the like.  

While we all make up the culture we live in, we're also individuals within it and often times powerless.  It doesn't excuse them, but it's an important context that shouldn't be ignored.  Oversimplifying rape and sexual assault in our culture helps perpetuate it even as the way we talk about it openly might change on the surface.",kkbeha
gvoz3w3,"Everyone's saying *Cruella* is going to be the female *Joker*, but this is it right here. A person with a humiliating job feels they've been wronged by society, and decides to don a wig and psuedonym to get revenge on the people who wronged them.

I was glad she got her comeuppance by the end, although I wish one the partygoers had woken up, called the police, told them what happened, and she was sitting in an institution by the end instead (like Joker, which had a satisfying ending). Plus it would have given us the chance to question if this was all a revenge fantasy in her head, although I'm not convinced it *isn't* the case either.

But even though I wish she was arrested instead of killed, she really had it coming. Everyone told her to stop and let it go, but she didn't. What did she expect was going to happen? I was clapping and cheering when Al broke loose and started pinning her down.

Which also ties into Ryan's character. He obviously regretted being there at the party from probably 8 or 9 years ago. He didn't deserve what Cassie did and said to him. I was laughing when he called her a fucking failure because it felt so good for him to fight back in that scene and honestly it's true. People change. Ryan changed. Al changed. God, watching him try to get out of the situation when he was handcuffed was heartbreaking to watch. She was a sociopath and bully of the highest order. 

Ryan, Al, the lawyer, and her father feel like the only real male charatcers in this. The rest feel a bit too much like r/WomenWritingMen. They're at least allowed to have emotions besides horny, anger, and fear.

Weirdly, the most unbelievable part was where she takes a tire iron to a truck being driven by Road Rage Guy, and then the guy just...leaves. I was hoping to see the rest of the scene to see how she was going to creatively get herself out of the situation. But nope, he just drives off without a fight.

Anyway, I wasn't sure what to expect going in, but besides all the mistakes I listed above, I enjoyed it as horror-thriller. Cassie is probably the most fun to watch movie monster I've seen in a couple years. Don't stick your dick in crazy, fellers.",kkbeha

It kind of surprises me, in hindsight, that Cassie wasn't more on the lookout for a potential connection between him and Nina's rape. Like, ""wait a minute - you're still buddy-buddy with Madison and Al? Hmmm."" One interpretation of that might be that we *all* get blindsided by ""a good guy"" even when we're sure none exist.

He has such cognitive dissonance in that he cannot bear to even say “rape” out loud, it’s so repulsive to him yet it was him who did it. Perhaps Joe’s role in assuring him he isn’t culpable for his dirty deeds give us a peek into how such disgusting behavior was excused and rationalized many times over and how that resulted in Nina’s sexual assault. Joe also serves as a metaphor for the media sex assault cases of young women over the last decade in which judges, lawyers, and others have coddled the assailants from their actions; making excuses for them, minimizing their guilt and subsequent damage, and often times attempting to imply that the charges have caused disruption to the “poor poor little rapists”. So sad that those things have played out in real life and in some cases, resulted in suicide by the women who have been through it. I think I appreciated that Al had if not remorse, a true sense that he did something wrong and bad, that he was at fault for - this wasn’t a sociopathic creep without empathy, which is truly that much more chilling as the same can be said for Ryan. We have to ask ourselves some hard questions as a society about how thinking and feeling young men and women could laugh at a sexual assault or fail to interject or even worse, be the person committing it.",kkbeha
gl29zd0,I thought that scene was comedic super villain bad. Especially since evidence that she was attacking him (and roofy'ing everyone else) was everywhere. They world have just called the police... Instead they had time to burn her body AND be on time and on point for the wedding?,kkbeha
ho7wdnw,"> He could overpower her without killing her. But he just kept going.

I don't think so. He couldn't escape the 2nd cuff which is why the breaking dawn scene is kinda important. He thought he had nobody to protect him as she drugged all the people downstairs. It was kill or be carved.

I think it's important that he isn't really given a choice here as Cassie's death is important for him to go to trial. It should be argued as self defense at his trial. It was self defense. 

The important point though is he's getting a trial. Like Molina's character showed, when you go to trial teams of people do everything they can to discredit you. That starts with the video. That video then ties everyone at that wedding like Schmidt and Bo.

Nina's going to be able to speak her truth because of that video which probably would have been brushed aside as boys will be boys  if Cassie didn't die at this particular boy's bachelor party. That was the whole point of the conversation with the Dean. Now this video is pretty damning evidence of what his character is and that's really what Cassie's revenge has been all about. Showing these people who they really are after they destroyed a person's life and forgot about it.

It gives you the false comfort that Ryan is the one for Cassie, but the movie rips that away with the reveal he was in the video, and twists the knife even more when he lies to police about her disappearance.",kkbeha
gjjcqmj,"The pharmacy scene seemed like it was taking the movie in the exact direction I was worried it was going to go - she falls for the guy and settles down and it turns into a rather anticlimactic romantic ending. One of the really brilliant things about that scene, though, if you watch closely you’ll notice everyone in the background is looking on them disapprovingly. The cashier, in particular, looks downright *ticked off* at them, probably because they’re making a mess and she’s going to have to clean it up. Even the other customer in the store looks uncomfortable, like they’re just being disruptive and weird. Contrast that with typical romcoms where this kind of childish behavior in (young) adults in love is met with indulgent smiles by any onlookers. As they leave, Cassie apologizes. It’s brief, but it’s there. 

The romcom contrast of that whole montage segment of them falling in love fits in with the rest of the movie by juxtaposition. Just as it seems she’s moving on with her life, that traumatic past rears its ugly head again: she gets the video from Madison and finds out Ryan was at the party. It’s like she was finally starting to heal and then something happens to send everything crashing down again. The highs in the middle of the plot make everything that happens after that much more impactful.",kkbeha
glcbqam,"I think the pharmacy scene is really powerful because, at that point, we already have evidence that Ryan is a creep.  He's already pulled the ""boy gee howdy my apartment is right here"" act, and we know that he's still in touch with ""the group"" from med school.  The pharmacy scene and ensuing montage manages to still capture your attention and think ""maybe this will work out!"" which is the whole point.  You, as an audience member, are willing to overlook predatory and shitty behavior just because it didn't actually go ""there"" yet.  Cassie herself makes the same mistake ... she's so entrenched in the world of guys who prey more aggressively that she overlooks the clear red flags because he's kind and charming.",kkbeha

giyxt7o,"My entire take is that she planned to die. Otherwise I doubt someone like her would make the mistake of using faulty handcuffs. The only way the plan was going to go through and she could get back at this guy who took away the angel in her life was to get him to murder her, or at least create an opportunity for him to murder her. In a sense it would prove that he isn't a nice guy, he isn't a gentlemen and all along he had the will to kill a woman. Yes, it's self-defense but I believe the scenario wouldn't have worked with anyone. I wouldn't have killed her if I was in the same situation. All throughout the movie she is shown to be an expert at manipulating people with the perception of crossing the line but never actually crossing the line. For her I thought once all hope was lost of having a normal life she decided to get revenge for her friend and gain peace all at the same time.",kkbeha
gjjh7vx,"I love your analysis on a lot of this, but I just gotta say, what do you mean the guys stop before it goes too far? In the first few scenes we see a guy pull her panties off without her consent, touching her all over her legs and who knows where else. That’s sexual assault. Later we see that guy who played McLovin put his fingers in her, again without her consent. That’s rape. 

Don’t get me wrong, I was oddly comfortable with these scenes when I was watching the movie, too. It actually didn’t hit me until I read your comment and I was like, hey wait a minute. Let’s call a spade a spade. 

This woman, this fictional character (thank goodness), is going out week after week and not speaking up until it crosses the line into sexual assault or rape. Her drunkenness is an act, sure, but the men she’s going home with don’t know that. The crimes, yes *crimes*, they’re committing are real. And then all she does is point that out to them and walk away, and yet in their minds they’re “nice guys” and *she’s* a “psycho”?! How messed up is that? I mean she definitely has some problems but they are far from nice. 

Beyond that... while it is deeply disturbing that her response to her friend getting raped and subsequently committing suicide is to go out and get raped and assaulted *every week* for who knows how long, only to write some names in a little book and do nothing else (like what is her end game? is she just running an experiment? is this amateur sociology? or just masochism?) and that speaks to some possible serious psychological problems on her part, it’s equally disturbing that we as the audience can watch that and go, what a relief at least it didn’t go too far! I think I need to just sit for a minute with, not just how fucked up that premise actually is, but how desensitized we the audience must be to find it so benign.

Edit: Holy shit I think I get it! If we look at Cassie’s character as a metaphor/stand-in for a rape survivor, then her habit of going out and getting assaulted every week makes so much more sense, because it represents the survivor reliving their trauma over and over again.",kkbeha

gmsntcq,"The scene with Nina's mom also read as really sad and tragic to me.

Cassie is hurting herself but also kind of hurting Nina's family too.",kkbeha
gvlz9wl,I knew she didn’t pay the guy to rape Madison but what I can’t understand is how Cassie could trust him not to do it anyway given her beliefs about men.  She seems awfully confident that the low life criminal she hired to pretend to rape Madison didn’t (and wouldn’t) do anything to her given she wasn’t there.,kkbeha
gjdx5wl,"I had conflicting feelings about Cassie. She was doing awful things herself, even if she thought she was doing them for the right reason. Her death had less of an impact on me because of it....she was lost to revenge. Don’t get me wrong, I felt for her situation, but her acts of revenge were damaging. She was no saint herself.",kkbeha
gh2au9p,"My guess is that it was based on how far the guys tried to go with her before she stopped them. For example, in the scene with Mintz-Plasse , Cassie gives him the slightest bit of credit because he woke her up before taking advantage of her whereas others don't even bother with that.

I just confirmed what I saw watching the movie, but there are actually three colors in the notebook: black, red, and blue. But it's easy to miss the blue considering how close it is to black. My best interpretation is that one color means they tried taking advantage of her while passed out, one means they tried taking advantage while awake, and one means they didn't try taking advantage of her sexually? That third one seems like a stretch, but I can't think of another scenario that matches it at the moment.",kkbeha
ghdyxp0,"Yeah exactly my question. At the start of the film I thought she was murdering these guys but quickly became evident that's not the case. I'm wondering if the intention of the red markings was to make us believe this (as it's what it appears in the trailer)

or maybe she was a killer and we never knew???? (Unlikely)",kkbeha
gjja04f,"I’m pretty sure that’s just one of those pens that they make for kids that writes in multiple colors. They were really popular with the girls in grade school. Remember that even though what happened to Nina happened in med school, their friendship went back much farther than that. The picture of them on the mirror in Cassie’s room looks like it’s from elementary or middle school. In her grief over Nina, Cassie seems to be taking comfort in (and finding added significance in) things that remind her of their friendship from much farther back in their history. The cutesy pink and blue pen is just another callback to when they were kids and everything was ok, before everything went wrong, when they still had their whole lives ahead of them.",kkbeha
ghflrk2,"I don't think we ever saw her make a red mark. I was wondering if she herself was the ""one with the scissors"" when she mentioned there were more like her out there. Judging by her plan at the party, she would seem to have the ability to commit some violence.",kkbeha

ghqy3gu,"It really was. Also, lack of mental health care in this country in this country as well as services and assistance provided. Cassie didn’t get the help she needed and neither did Nina. Nina’s mother, Cassie’s parents, etc responded aggressively and dismissively. Criticism does nothing for the traumatized. She needed help she didn’t get. She was betrayed by literally everyone in her life. Those not affected by something think saying “Move on” is helpful and just moving on is easy. It’s not.

grp5dnv,"I think the point was the even if someone gets revenge or justice, the trauma will still be there. We want Cassie to ""win"" so that we can feel happy about her journey and in the end imagine she feels whole. Instead the film ends tragically, and the audience leaves feeling ""But why did she have to die? Why couldn't they have left her alone?"" and if the point of the film is to make it very clear to the audience the behaviour depicted is wrong, varioys ways it happens, how people rationalize the behaviour, and ultimately leave you with a feeling of loss and emptiness that makes you want to do something about the problem, the film had accomplished its goals completely, imho.",kkbeha

gk1wkbh,"This also really struck me because it's a brilliant way of using comparisons between the men depicted in the film to demonstrate how low standards can drop when faced with a constant barrage of shitty behaviour. 

For example, we initially see men who refuse to take ""no"" for an answer, and continue to force Cassie into situations. By comparison, Ryan immediately apologises to Cassie and doesn't make her come inside when she is clearly uncomfortable. However, he did still intentionally walk her to his apartment without her knowledge. But we might be more willing to overlook the bad behaviour because *Hey at least he didn't force her inside, right?* 

Similarly, Cassie is swore at on several occasions throughout the film - being called a c\*\*\* is of particular note. So Ryan calling her a ""miserable bitch"" in a teasing tone is more forgivable right? Right?! 

I'm sure we could point out more examples like this. It really struck me because it's a great demonstration of how accustomed you can become to abusive behaviour... to the point where you don't even notice it anymore.",kkbeha

I loved that too. I loved how she cut right through all bullshit, but clearly still retained a sense of self and compassion .

On the other hand, Bo _tells_ her to forgive him, and she doesn’t (why would she?). I liked how they wrote two different characters and what they feel the are or are not entitled to.

I thought it was really interesting how they portrayed and covered so many ways people deal with this whether they were victims (Nina, Cassie, their parents) or the complicit ones (...everyone else?).

gkhcaoq,"The film pays homage to the 1955 film Night of the Hunter in several ways: it is the black and white movie her parents are watching before her first date; the movie is about a man who presents himself as a nice guy in order to serially victimize women; the song playing when she discovers what Ryan has done is sung by one of the main characters in NotH. One of the things Night of the Hunter is famous for is its incredible use of light and shadows, and the climax of NotH also has an important night-to-day transition. I think that moment and a lot of the lighting in general could be influenced by that older film. (When the film first started I kept saying, ""Why is it so damn dark?""

ghog37y,"> Fennell didn’t use stand-ins, so the scene was meticulously choreographed to ensure Mulligan and Lowell’s safety. “My father-in-law is an ex cop, so I asked him how long it would take, roughly, to suffocate someone,” Fennell said. “[He said] two and a half minutes. It was very dangerous, because it’s all in real time, and if something had gone wrong, we wouldn't have known because it would have looked real. So, we had safeguards and codes. We were very safety-conscious.”

I remember thinking once or twice during that scene that they *MUST'VE* used a stunt double for Mulligan and was looking at the body's knees and arms to see if they used a male or female stunt double (not as rare as one would think esp in something like a high-production music video that's just for one particular scene or whatnot), wowza props to Mulligan

Agreed. I think Cassandra suffers in her own person the abuse, then rejection, then finally death of her best friend, and all this severs her from engaging in life. Interestingly, she's never really seen to be enjoying herself until the romance montage, the only part of the story where she's started to follow Nina's mom's advice and let go of all that. It seems as though she really lives for nothing but to put the fear of God into men - or perhaps do them violence herself? - and since this is all she lives for, she's willing to die doing it. Not only does the ending of the movie evidence this, the very fact that she goes out weekend after weekend, putting herself into very vulnerable situations (sober or no), speaks to that as well.

I also think picking songs by two women who have been destroyed by the media and the general societal view of women in the mid 2000's (when the male characters were adolescents), and who were once ""sex symbols"" when the male characters were adolescents was a brilliant choice to show that these men do not see women as people, even when they pretend they are ""good guys.""",kkbeha

It seemed weird that people didn't react to someone walking around with blood on them (even in a city lol), but it being ketchup wouldn't raise many alarm bells so there's that. After the second guy, it solidified to me that she wasn't doing anything physical as she didn't need or intend to, which also plays out in other ways throughout the film. The fedora guy mentions Jerry around the half point which let the audience know he was still alive.

The score book confused me as well since I thought maybe the red ink meant she'd killed them, but I think that might've been a tally for severity of the offense or ""success.""

""Whoever *fights monsters* should see to it that in the process he does not *become* a *monster*.""  


Cassie was in great pain, but would not let her friend nor her suicide nor her own suicide-by-another die in vain with her.

This movie was very cathartic, and didactic in a subtle way, at least for me. 

Although it uses the particulars of a very relevant topic, the particulars of someone being harmed, especially while extremely vulnerable, can be applied to so many situations. It is a terrible world out there. The maps no longer demarcate ""there me monsters."" And it has be asking, where in myself can I locate such a monster; what can wake the monsters within me. 

Maybe the point isn't just that anyone can be a monster, but that our own selves can be. Othering evil and seeing people as being just good and evil misses a point that more than being relevant and contemporaneous, is something to understand about humanity on the whole.

grqaqih,"I have my theories; here's one where the red pen significance is a little ""out there"".

Jerry got black pen, and as we learn later from Fedora Guy, has characterized Cassie as a ""crazy bitch"", implying he didn't take her lesson to heart. McLovin AKA Neil got the blue pen, and we see that he's unwilling to violate a passed out Cassie, and also he admits to being a piece of shit when confronted. So, the most positive outcome a man who makes her list could achieve.

So black pen is a non-violent fail, blue is a success, and then we have red pen and are given so little to go on in regards to what it means that we must think outside the box. 

We see from the Madison and Jordan(the lawyer) encounters that Cassie is not above hiring shady dudes to do what Cassie is unable or unwilling to do herself. We also see how prolific she has been with the suddenly sober surprise. So many names in that book, and she's never been harmed by one of these creeps? Methinks these two things are connected. Perhaps Cassie has a hired thug follow her on these missions, to intervene if the target won't back off once the jig is up, or reacts violently to being tricked. This would be an encounter that warrants use of the red pen. I learned in an interview with Carey Mulligan that they filmed something that didn't make it into the final cut, that shows that sometimes the men DID get violent, resulting in Cassie getting her arm bruised. My guess is that this cut content was meant to be part of the only red pen encounter in the movie, of which we are shown nothing and only hear Cassie and a man talking in voice over before seeing Cassie make the red mark in the book. She's only saved further harm by the guy she hired.",kkbeha

I see how ending could definitely come off as predictable/cheap, but I think there was just SO much going on there between the lines once you start to read into it more. Like, 

1) Al is a freaking doctor!! who's supposed to have sworn to the hippocratic oath! 

2) If he came to his senses after seeing her passed out, he could've tried to resuscitate her or something (idk, I'm not a doctor but im almost he could've done something or at least tried!)

3) He had the whole. sober. night. to think about what just happened, how he just suffocated her to death. to be ridden with guilt stuck there right beside her dead body. but his response when he's found in the morning? not a trace of it, all he was worried about was himself. Not to mention Joe, who just acted EXACTLY as terribly comical and exaggerated as you'd hate for him to be. Probably my #2 favorite character in the movie

Feel like that was absolutely intentional with the long shots on her body and how they kept her out-of-focus in the morning after scene but still in the shot, it was absolutely framed like a standard horror movie ""zombie comes back to life to attack unsuspecting person"" type of shot where the audience sees that resurrection before the other characters. Then the firepit scene made me think ""Oh fuck, here it is, while they're burning her stuff before they bury her, she's probably getting a weapon and is gonna come kill these fuckers when they least expect it!"" then nope, we see the hand get kicked back into the firepit in a hilariously cruel moment that finalizes the gut-punch that's been simmering by letting you know she's absolutely dead.

gnjs35s,"I had a feeling that she was going to die, just because up to that point the movie had lacked the reality of violence in sexual assault. Al the other guys were shocked and repentant when she caught them. In reality, tricking a guy in the middle of an attempted assault would most likely end in violence, especially if the guy had something to lose, family, children, high profile job. Al was known to be a potentially violent predator, who tapes and assault and invites his friends to watch and I am assuming participate? He would have been the most likely to react violently to having to answer for his actions especially having to answer to a woman. The way the guys treat his wife is telling as well, she’s a bikini model, that is all. Women are objects whose roles is to protect and support men who are the main characters in life. Once they step out of line or confront instead of support or understand or attempt to empathize they are able to be discarded. I was only surprised that they didn’t get away with it. That to me was the twist. 

In reality a group of “promising young men” who are doctors and important parts of the community would most likely have buried the nobody stripper and never been found out. Questioned and considered maybe but never actually arrested. 

Great movie.",kkbeha

It was like you said. If they'd just called the police and shown that she wasn't an actual stripper, drugged everyone, handcuffed him and had fucking scalpels and shit laid out on a table it would've been an easy case.

gita7uk,"Wait, what were Cassie’s major flaws?",kkbeha
gva47jj,"Just my personal thoughts. I think the pointlessness in her not killing the men does have a place in the film.

In the scene where the guy calls her ""the psycho Jerry took home"" there was an air and dejectedness with her after. She could justify it to herself before but not anymore. Her motivation for her bar stuff was guilt from not being able to save Nina. She was punishing herself.  The film deals with her realising that her revenge doesn't actually fix anything or make her feel better.

For me theres an air of sadness about some bits, especially with her parents and Nina's mom. Sometimes it feels like shes crying out for help but they just tell her to move on rather than actually try to help her. (Though it's more understandable with Nina's mom as Cassie's not moving on keeps reopening old wounds)

I dont think the movie is glamorous what Cassie does. Like her reactions after the scenes with Madison and the Dean. And the script says that the whole thing starts to scare her. That why she tries to move on with Ryan. But finding out his involvement broke her and she goes back to her self destructive ways.

There were even a few scenes that felt very American Psycho-ish, I thought they would show us murders but then have a ""was it all in her head?"" kind of ending like AP did.

Obviously, self defense only goes so far, though, cause you can just call the police and say it was self defense but taking the steps to burn the body and all that is conspiracy, and that's a big issue.

Problem is, she kinda banks her entire life on the fact that she thinks he/they are going to do just that; cover it up. What if he just claimed self defense and called the police and said she went psycho, locked him up, drugged his pals and tried to kill him?

There's ample evidence Cassie meant the man harm, so even with the cover-up, he's got self defense to argue. And it will probably fly. She did succeed in ruining the wedding, I suppose.

They were meant to be portrayed as the ""nice guy"" architype in movies we've seen in the past. Just from the drunk woman's point of view. The casting was absolutely intentional.",kkbeha
gla7q5d,"Thanks for this comment. It's got a heavy dose of truth that I think the culture does need to swallow. Now I want to be clear: I absolutely believe that the depiction of men in the movie is realistic. That being said, the question I've been asking women who have seen the movie is: are *all* guys like that, necessarily? In the film, there is not a single redeemable male character (except maybe the dad, but his role is very minimal and altogether nonsexual), and I agree with that as a directorial choice because making a redeemable male main character would have made the film's whole conceptual thrust fall flat.

Maybe I'm missing the point with this question. Thoughts?",kkbeha
hz5712k,I think the ending actually does a great job of establishing that rape cases aren't taken seriously at all in this country. Cassie had to *die* for Nina's rapist to face literally any consequences. Murder holds way more moral capital to our society than rape for whatever reason.,kkbeha
i10tqj0,"I agree that the movie was all over the place and completely unbelievable, but I think that's what it was intending to do. Comical, satiric, and over the top but disturbingly true. I wasn't happy that she died, but it made sense. Especially as something she would've anticipated but didn't plan to avoid completely as she didn't have much to live for anyway, didn't wanna be or do much aside from get revenge (based the part where she tells her boss she could be and do anything great if she wanted to, but she simply didnt want it)",kkbeha
ikib9bs,"Hot take: Cassie is not only extremely intelligent but also very depressed and self destructive. She had the foresight to schedule texts for the future, implying she knew the possibility of it ending poorly for her, and maybe, during that few day interval after being happy with Ryan and moving on, and then doing a full 180 after seeing him on that video and planning the revenge, she did have sort of a ""fuck it all"" death wish, or at the very least had given up on ever having any sort of closure personally (being betrayed by ""one of the good ones"") and was having suicidal ideation in that sense. 

Side point, the timeline also explains your point about why her plan was a bit sloppy and not perfectly executed, not only had she not been stewing on it for months or years (as she thought Al was overseas and had given up on revenge on him personally), but she literally didn't have the intel of the location of the party and how she'd infiltrate to get Al alone until the day before. This movie doesn't try to make their main protagonist perfect, it definitely highlights her mental illness, the fact that she lives at home at 30 with no aspirations or goals, and that's what I feel made it very impactful. Same with them not painting the two villains (Ryan the secret surprise villain and even Al, the ""end Boss"" of the movie) as caricatures, but as whole people who do have redeeming qualities as well. 

I really enjoyed the pacing, subjective I know, but to counterpoint your ""suspending disbelief"" critique, I felt everything from the sets to the wardrobe to the color grading made this movie feel  ""over the top"" and fantastical, so suspending disbelief was kind of written into that with all the other design choices.",kkbeha

gubpm48,"The sequence that song is used in is pretty incredible too. [This is the sequence.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwlSrpMK3VA&ab_channel=Straussian)

The director originally had a very different sequence in the middle of the film, and Robert Mitchum told a story about being shocked to see this whole sequence when he saw the final cut. All done in-studio in the silent German expressionist style (the same style that influenced early Tim Burton films). One of the most beautifully-shot sequences in the history of cinema in my opinion and something that's influenced everything from the Coen brothers to Spike Lee. 

(Also, the final scene of that sequence, right [here](https://youtu.be/DwlSrpMK3VA?t=374), is actually a person with dwarfism on a Shetland pony, to get the proportions right.)",kkbeha

gjof5dg,"Yes. Men who stand by, don't speak up, don't condemn the actions of their peers ABSOLUTELY have a responsibility in perpetuating rape culture and violence against women. 

It's always on women to change their behaviour. It's what we have done to survive over and over again and yet, men are not asked to adjust how they behave. Now, I think the conversations are happening and changes are in progress but when I found out Bo's character was one of the bystanders, I immediately stopped liking him. Something like that isn't just a moment of shame  or a 'stupid thing you did as a kid' it's an opportunity to point out that this behaviour or act of violence is WRONG. If you are a man who stays silent in these moments then you are participating to an extent. 

How can we ever expect equality if men aren't willing to have this conversation with each other?

Also, in the film the participants in the assault keep saying ""we were kids, we were kids"" yeah, they were in their 20s...full grown adults.",kkbeha

gjf5cpq,"For me, I loved the ending. She never actually crossed that line into really taking revenge. She was never actually a super hero and it was really striking to me that Al would appear to win again only to be brought down finally in death- where neither woman could be argued with. They quite literally got the last word and everyone else gets to deal with the fallout which is the exact opposite of what happened to Nina. From a character point of view- even if Cassandra had gotten to Al, she would not have been able to move on. She needed some light in the world again, and it was just constantly being snuffed out.  Her character arc was beautiful that just when you thought she might be able to stop her descent- speaking to Nina’s mom, the lawyer repenting, finding new hope with Ryan- it’s ripped away from her. As good as she thought Ryan was he watched her beat friend get raped and had zero qualms about it and it just proved to her that there is no light.  In that respect her ending gave her peace and allowed her to achieve her goal.",kkbeha

So it’s more a reflection of how doing nothing ends up only helping the bad people.",kkbeha

Yeah, but did you see how long he was pushing the pillow to her face. He wasn't manic or defending himself after the first 10 seconds(10 seconds is a lot). Also, she was like 110lbs. he didn't need over 2 minutes to ""defend"" himself. He smothered her to stop her from ruining his life altogether. I don't think she wanted to kill him. she was gonna cut Nina's name on his chest. If she killed she would be in deep trouble even if she left that cabin alive because Ryan knew she would go there. If she had just cut him, he wouldn't even be able to go to the cops. His marriage would have been ruined at best.",kkbeha

gy9bhju,"I'm late to this thread since I only just watched the movie but I think the point with her death serves many meanings. 

1. She is suicidal. She was from the start of the film and there are small cues from other encounters that not all of them ended in nonviolence. 

2. The rape Nina went through wrecked multiple lives. Cassie dropped out of school. Though they don't say it, it's likely Nina committed suicide. That also has dramatic affects on Nina's mother and Cassie's parents. No one wants to acknowledge this, not the rapist, his friends, the Dean, Ryan or Madison. Not until it affected them personally. 
3. Her death would have been covered up just like Nina's rape had she not held contingency plans because her death, like so many real women's deaths, fail to impact the lives of their murderers. Poor women, women of color, indigenous women, and the mentally ill, are killed at disproportionate rates without their cases ever being solved. Her case would likewise, just been another missing girl who probably wanted to die anyway. And it was made clear when the cop was talking to Ryan at the end, they weren't going to look very hard for her. 

It's a sad ending. I kept waiting for her to get up and be faking it. But while the empowering revenge fantasy element is there throughout the movie, the ending has the more realistic likelihood of what happens.",kkbeha
gyoa0r4,"I was completely sad and uncomfortable with her dying as well. I kept hoping there would be another twist and she would not be dead.

So I think it was the right choice.",kkbeha

I saw her as finally at peace. She was never going to trust again.,kkbeha

Even though survivors tragically receive the life sentence, one of the most powerful things you can do is live your life regardless.

I think the point of the hollow victory was to show that with the mentality of boys will be boys and don't ruin these promising futures (see promising young man....a name given to numerous numerous men who committed rape and a reason not to let their future go down the trash) that there is no way she could win. The only possible way to win was to be willing to die and lose her life because she knew that instead of claiming it as self defense or anything else... Al didn't want a stripper at his party so he'd be caught with that to his new wife and he was too worried about image to claim self defense , so she knew he would try to get away with it. She knew he would cover it up just as he'd done before, and thus her way to get the victory was to die.",kkbeha

Her real vengeance appears to be on the people directly involved with Nina's case, and giving them scares, like pretending to kidnap the Dean's daughter, and getting Alison Brie's character blackout drunk.  Then, after learning of the video, it becomes wanting actual physical harm on these people.

Given she started her ""master plan"" before knowing about the tape and that the Al part must have been planned beforehand (by virtue of it being one of the roman numeral cues), I assume she was going to do it regardless and finding the video gave her something to hang over Ryan to force him to tell Cassie where the bachelor party was",kkbeha

The cop scene was Ryan's chance for redemption, and instead of telling the police where Cassie, the woman he professed to love, had gone, he chose to protect himself and Al, his male friend. He still went to Al's wedding even after seeing the clip of him raping Nina.

Still though I don't think the point is whether he gets convicted. The meeting with the Dean was about whether or not these people even get a light shined on them. He now most definitely will have pressure applied and will never be able to live down his crime because the person leading the charge is a lawyer overcome with guilt over burying these types of crimes. This will be his redemption as he does everything he can to destroy the credibility of a rapist.

It's not really about whether or not he goes to jail for Cassie's murder. More that he gets smeared with what he did and the crimes he committed (including raping Nina) get shown. Everyone involved in the rape will have to respond because they were at the wedding and in the video. Her death was her pulling a pin on a grenade. She wanted to blow everything up and she did. 

One could argue he isn't guilty of Cassie's murder as she went there to carve him up like a turkey. He is guilty though of Nina's rape and that's what his trial will put on for full effect. Also of the lesser charger for the coverup, but the murder is a bit of a gray area.",kkbeha

I didn’t take it as a commentary on male depravity so much as a commentary on how sexual violence against women is treated and how serious it really is, how insidious our attitudes as a society are. Some men in the film were beyond redemption but I don’t think it meant to say all of them are. 

It’s been a long time since I saw a movie I wanted to discuss this much, this is great haha

ETA— I took her death as part of a message that like, it literally takes a woman sacrificing herself to get any semblance of justice for the sexual violence that ruined her friends life, we are so worried about ruining a boys life with false accusations but what about the converse?? What about all the lives ruined when nothing is done?? This film just relentlessly hammers every aspect of society that allows this to happen to women",kkbeha

ghdn6g9,"I'm still processing/stomaching the ending, and this interpretation really makes me land on the side of loving the film. I just haven't had an ending bring out such a raw range of emotions from the nasty taste in my mouth, to shock, anger, devastation. I just couldn't believe it happened, even after she was definitely dead I kept expecting her to somehow play dead, grab the weapon and stab him or something. The full realization of her actually being dead took a bit of time to fully hit me. 

And right before that scene, I felt the film was great, but kind of pulling its punches. Like, yeah, it's twisted, but based on the hype I had heard it hadn't really fucked me up in any way. They never really showed what she did in detail, beyond the psychological aspect (did she kill Adam Brody? or just torture him?) And then that happened and I was just ""well, fuck"". Now I understand why a lot of people are going to absolutely hate this, but had she just castrated him and then walked out of the party and drove off, I would have just said ""that was it?"". They really had the balls to go all the way, and I both love it and hate it.

I also really loved the scene with the dean, performed brilliantly, the writing is perfect, and I actually believed what she was saying just like the dean. Mulligan and Connie Britton were perfection. Britton is really underrated, as an AHS stan I loved seeing her, too. One of my favorite scenes of the whole year. It's delicious.

2) You're definitely going to fight against being smothered. Hard to be coldly calculating and logical when you're actively having the life snuffed out of you. Besides which, there's no way Al would have let her live. Catch the brutal ankle pull maneuver he does when she does stop struggling(too weak from lack of oxygen) that sharpens the angle of his knee and forces almost his full weight onto her neck. He goes for the finishing move because she's revealed that she has a tape of the sexual assault on Nina and he hopes that if she's dead it won't come out.",kkbeha
gqjmff5,"3. I think Cassie's plan was to get Al to kill her so he would be arrested for her murder. When it comes to all the other revenge sequences, Cassie's plan is to make them rethink or regret their part in Nina's failure to gain justice. The revenge is supposed to parallel what happened seven years ago. Madison doesn't believes sleeping with someone unwilling while drunk is rape, until Cassie makes her believe that same thing happened to her. The dean decides to dismiss Nina's case and believe that she should give the accused the benefit of the doubt, until Cassie makes her believe the dean's daughter is at stake. And since Al didn't get arrested, Cassie's revenge plan is to get him arrested, and make sure he knows it's because that he raped Nina. If that wasn't her plan, she wouldn't have used plastic handcuffs or she would have sedated him.",kkbeha

The movie is a study in not dismissing rape allegations because the rapists seems nice, or they're someone you know. Ryan specifically is about the passivity that makes us complicit. He didn't care what happened, he wasn't for it and he doesn't like those ""friends"" of his at all. Even now years after it's easier for him, better for him to just not acknowledge it.

grud2dk,"You're really only looking at her actions on the surface.  This is a woman dealing with EXTREME survivor's guilt. Her guilt was so great that she destroyed herself after being unable to protect her best and closest friend, a friend she bonded with since early childhood.  A dear friend who amazed her for even BEING her friend, much less her closest friend.  A friend who was violently raped and then constantly ridiculed over it until she was forced to quit medical school (and Cassie had to leave too to take care of her)... who then killed herself.

What are the repercussions that she would be afraid of?  In both the cases of the Dean and her ex-college friend, any repercussions Cassie would be dealing with would pale in comparison to the repercussions that those two women would have to suddenly deal with when Cassie explains WHY she did it.

""Why yes, I did get a woman drunk and paid a man to take her to a hotel room.  But 1) she wasn't raped and I have proof that she wasn't and 2) you'll never guess who WAS raped and who tormented the victim leading to their suicide.""  ""Why yes, I did take her daughter and took her to a diner and left her there briefly... but Judge, can we get into why the Dean of this prestigious medical school purposely ignored the rape of a student who later killed themselves?""  It was a calculated decision.  Everything Cassie did was calculated.  She wasn't dumb and always had contingency plans.

And yeah, she let guys violate her to shame them.  Because she didn't care about HERSELF anymore!  When she started caring about herself again was when she was with Ryan, and that's when she stopped going after guys in clubs.  Then the rest of the movie happened.

Regarding her having money for mobsters (I assume that's what you are asking)... you can save a lot of money if you are living at home rent free and only going out one night a week to shame guys.  Most likely she had been living at home for at least 5-8 years after dropping out of med school.",kkbeha

Definitely felt it was more about self-destruction and commentating on the fact that it's a cultural and systemic, not individual, problem. This is expressed by the nice guys, Alison Brie's character, the dean, and the lawyer and their interactions with Cassandra. She has the most elaborate punishments for the women even though all the above contribute to rape culture. It all indicates that her pursuit of ""confronting the bad guys"" was just an individual addictive habit and how she coped with what happened not a noble crusade on a wider issue or justice for Nina (the meeting with Nina's mom cements this). Everything with we are shown about Cassie's addiction and how she lives her life generally is portrayed negatively and we see that it ends how it ends. With that interpretation, the ending and comeuppances made some sense me but I really didn't feel good or reassured about any of it but that probably wasn't the point. What happened at the end with the cops swooping in was just her final act of vengeance and I think that makes it as bleak as the rest of the film. There were no systematic policy changes, no advocacy for shifts in cultural attitudes, not even any characters actually expressing how they want to make things better, so really nothing that would prevent or reduce what happened to Nina from happening to others.

It IS stupid to kidnap a child IRL. In the movie, it’s a plot device used to confront a corrupt institution where a woman in power turns her back on young women in danger. In the suspension of my disbelief, I assumed that the thought exercise provided to the dean made her realize how truly deplorable her inaction was/is. (“What if it was MY daughter that was alone in a room with sketchy-ass college boys and alcohol?? What if HER dean did nothing?”) Maybe she’ll be better in the future; maybe she was horrified and grateful her daughter was safe and she reacted in an unpredictable way. Maybe the dean changed. 

She knew her ex-friend would drink to the point of getting drunk because they used to be friends. She encouraged her to keep talking about herself and to keep drinking, until the alcohol did the encouraging for her. I’ll give you that she couldn’t guarantee that the man wouldn’t rape her ex-friend, and it’s not cool to put women in danger... I don’t think you need to agree, morally, with the character’s actions in order to appreciate the story. 

The dean’s daughter likely has public social media profiles but the bachelor party’s location was “top secret.” Probably to keep (future) wives from finding out about sketchy behavior. 



I wouldn’t say that any of the things she did were stupid. I think she wanted to die. She’d felt dead for so long- living for the memory of her friend and what happened to her. She found a way to hold the man that caused her life’s downward spiral fully accountable in the most twisted, beautiful way possible. For a movie, that is. 

Idek what to say about your last few sentences except, honestly.... Jesus Christ. “She played with fire trying to enact a stupid revenge by being alone in a room with dangerous men stronger than her and alienating them on purpose. Death is the realistic outcome for this, and I think it gives a nice conclusion....” If the conclusion that you pull out of this movie is that women need to keep themselves safe from dangerous men.... god help you.",kkbeha

Because he was the man named in her letter and they don't have to charge him with murder right away since they can charge him with Nina's rape right away with the video, no double jeopardy because it never went to court the first time since the charges were dropped. While they have an excuse to hold him for that they can press him until he gives a confession regarding Cassie (now her murder, but at the time of arrest questioning as to her whereabouts). 

>the time line of the missing person's report happened seemingly right away and the doctor was questioned at the hospital quickly.
>Was the wedding a week after the party? 

Ryan says they broke up a week before, and her parents reported her missing the very next day. I think she left left before the actual bachelor party and not that the gap is between the bachelor party and the wedding but between when Cassie stopped showing up for work.

gjqky4r,"Hey friend. Also a fellow survivor here. I get why you would feel that way, but I think it was necessary. First of all, I don’t think this movie would be getting all the talk and buzz if it had been just your typical revenge flick, and Cassie had gotten her vengeance on Al and walked off into the sunset. Second of all, I think it’s a deliberate message. We as a society tend to sugarcoat date rape and the lasting effects it has on a person, but for many people it is that ugly. There is no healing. Sometimes a positive or uplifting ending can undermine the true horror, and I think the director’s intent was to shock the audience into grasping the true horror of sexual assault and violence against women. There is a great [Elle article](https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/amp35091139/promising-young-woman-survivors-remorse-ending-explained/?__twitter_impression=true) that makes the case that this movie is about the destructive nature of grief, particularly with survivors. The article ends with this powerful quote- “There's a saying in Africa [that] goes like this: ‘The child who's rejected will come back and burn the village down.’ Sadly, for Cassie, it’s with herself inside it.” 

I think that’s a powerful message that needed to be told. People often don’t fully grasp how our society’s failure to address this issue is not only destructive towards victims, but to *everyone.* I’m more incensed that this movie had to be made at all, than the film itself. It’s sad and infuriating that we have to keep banging that drum. 

But that said, the movie was very difficult to watch as a survivor and I’ve had a hard time shaking it as well. Take care of yourself, realize that something like this really has the potential to reopen old wounds and don’t be afraid to talk to someone or reach out. And hopefully one day we won’t need films like this to shock an audience into action or feeling. Hopefully one day this film will be outdated, because Nina’s situation would have never been handled like it was in the first place. And if you need to talk, my DMs are always open. ❤️",kkbeha

The whole film criticises the the idea of victimising men who have had their lives ruined by past misdeeds against women. To these men in the film who are prepared to sexually assault drunk women, the realisation that they are being watched by sober eyes is as damaging and threatening to them as if they were stabbed and killed in the typical thriller sense, because it threatens their promising careers. I think that's where to tension comes from in those scenes, not the physical stuff.

gu7miks,"You’re not supposed to agree with Cassie’s methods, but you’re supposed to at least sympathize with her. She’s literally the only character who’s committed to speaking the truth about Nina’s rape. Cassie’s family and Nina’s family are in an impossible position, so no one can blame them for trying to move forward. But still, no one else is pushing for justice. 

The lawyer and Cassie are both suffering from similar feelings. Cassie is getting some catharsis out of minor revenge acts, but we see her essentially in a daze, blacking out in the middle of the road. The lawyer is internalizing all of his guilt and suffers from a nervous breakdown. They are both characters being crippled by the their refusal to forget the truth. 

Every “happy” character in this movie either doesn’t know the truth or can’t bring themselves to process the truth. The grieving and concerned family members either don’t know what to believe or have chosen to make peace with it. The rapists, spectators of the rape, and those who saw the video convince themselves they didn’t do anything wrong and can’t even handle hearing about it without getting defensive. 

I’m pretty sure the “horror” of the movie is that the “nice guys” will always find women disposable the moment their own public and self image is threatened. 

I also disagree that this movie tells instead of shows. The majority of the movie is nuance. We don’t even know the full backstory until halfway through the movie. Also, “show, don’t tell” is not gospel. Creators make the call on what to tell and what to show, because showing requires a significant time investment. Even telling requires a lot of time since the context and form of the telling needs to feel organic.",kkbeha

gjswpne,"You make some really good points but there are a few things I disagree with. Personally I think including the lawyer was essential and kept the movie from being totally misanthropic/hopeless. He’s the one example of someone who participated in the rape culture that played out surrounding Nina’s assault (slut shaming/victim blaming) showing remorse and actually getting a chance to redeem himself. First by quitting his corrupt rapist-defense law firm and then by taking Cassie’s note and the phone to the police, thus getting to bring to justice one of the men he got off the hook before. 

I also think the film did a pretty good job of showing how careless Cassie had become with her own life. Pushing almost everyone away by lashing out and treating them rudely, sabotaging any chance at success or progress in her career, wallowing in her grief constantly (eg spending evenings looking at old pics of her and Nina) and aborting all of her plans for the future rather than moving on. And even though she plotted out her plans when she’d go out at night and protected herself somewhat by faking drunkenness, the vulnerability and danger is still present just by being a small woman alone in a man’s apartment. She just gets lucky that none of the men (at least none that we saw) decide to keep going or otherwise hurt her after she reveals herself to be sober. And with the tire iron and the truck, I was sooooo on edge when she was busting up his shit. Maybe it’s just my sensitivity to the word “cunt” but when I hear a man use that word, especially in a heated context like that, it feels like there’s a strong potential for violence. Like to throw that word around casually you have to really really hate women, and Al killing her at the end shows just how easily misogyny can escalate and reach the point of physical violence.",kkbeha

Carrey mulligan was very intense and the interactions were interesting especially between her and the two women. Then I was totally rooting for her and I found the murder really disturbing.  But then it got comical between the two men like a total change of tone.  At the end I was very confused.

gmcxu7w,"As a survivor myself, I respectfully disagree with this interpretation. I loved this movie and felt so seen by it. 

I didn’t feel that any part of the movie was made to make me, the audience, feel happy and to lazily have loose ends tied. The police come to the wedding because Cassie sends the note to the lawyer about her location in the event of her disappearance. They came to arrest them for murder, it’s still understood that there isn’t any punishment for Nina’s assault yet, just that these men finally went too far and committed a crime that our society understands is a crime. It wouldn’t have made sense for them to get away with this. 

Her death is not an exchange for justice. There is no justice here at all, her death was another vehicle to demonstrate how the patriarchy floods men with messages that say they are good and decent and superior no matter what their actions show otherwise. Al and Joe literally convince each other of their innocence in the bed with Cassie’s dead body beside them. Joe jokes about the trope of killing strippers at bachelor parties. They don’t even consider that Cassie is a real person with loved ones who will try to find her. Al will never accept that he is a bad person because he has never been told that his actions are wrong. Al, who spent the last few minutes of Cassie’s life insisting that he was a good guy who loved his fiancé so he wouldn’t sleep with a stripper to try to appear sympathetic and then sobbing that he “was just a kid” and “didn’t do anything wrong” even though his peer that he assaulted died by suicide because of his actions. And Cassie revealing how badly she wanted to be a doctor, but never got to have the life he got through no fault of her own. He still didn’t get it. None of them do. 

Even the lawyer is just another example of how men use women. He asks for her forgiveness, he talks about how his work affected him but never asks how she was affected by Nina. He uses her as free therapy the same way men do to women all the time. Her death also shows us what we suspected from the start - that our protagonist was unhinged, flawed, and ultimately not a hero, despite her carrying out the secret revenge fantasies so many women harbor. She couldn’t be saved by newfound love with Ryan, or Nina’s mom telling her to move on, or her parents who never understood what was going on. She was deeply traumatized and let an obsession consume her until it ended her life, that’s the real ending and a very upsetting one at that. 

I could have done without the scheduled texts, but it was somewhat cathartic watching one woman throw herself so fully into the mission of forcing people to understand how serious sexual assault is and how it can destroy victims’ lives. Men and women have been conditioned to always give the benefit of the doubt to the accused so that they can continue to reach their full potential. That causes devastating effects for not only survivors, but their loved ones too, and Cassie was an extreme example of that.",kkbeha
glgtvs8,"The way I interpreted the ending was that, unfortunately the police don’t take rape as seriously as murder. Some justice would have come of scarring Al’s body and Cassie getting away, but justice under the law never would’ve happened, even with the video. But with Cassie dead, with a good amount of evidence and with the lawyer having the tape and some instructions from Cassie, Al and Joe will be going to jail. Even if it’s like how it happens in real life, where Al claims self defense and hires the best lawyers money can buy, the both of them will still be tried for sexual assault for Nina and for the murder of Cassie and will serve some time (even if it’s not the multiple life sentences they deserve). I still find it realistic and didn’t see it as exploitative at all. This is my opinion, coming from someone who is also a survivor of sexual assault. I enjoyed the movie",kkbeha
glqam45,"**!SPOILERS!  !TW: talks about assault!**

&#x200B;

The arrest is not about the rape. In any universe the police would never arrest someone based on what is essentially a sex tape. Especially for such a serious charge as rape.  That's the sad truth, and to go into the movie expecting justice in a world modelled after our own only disappoints. Personally, I don't think the movie saw the end as justice. Al's friend runs away and Ryan goes unscathed. Now I would like to think that this would weigh down on their conscience for the rest of their lives, and they would become so haunted by their actions that they either turn themselves in or kill themselves, but that's just wishful thinking. At least Al is mentally broken at the end :)

He was arrested for murder, but in the movie it is pretty much the same thing. Listen to what his friends say before they enter the bedroom. ""Make sure she can't walk the next day!"" Even his best friend (forgot his name), when Al explicitly tells him that Cass is dead, he's like ""come on, you killed the stripper? That's so nineties"". He thinks that killing is a euphemism for sex. 

Cass explores this in her speech. After her assault ""Nina"" was dead. ""She only heard Al"". The happy, shrewd humour having Nina was gone. And in that same scene, Cass calls herself Nina. I happen to think the movie is successful. Who Cass was before ""dies"" and she carries Nina's trauma, adopting her shrewd humour and upbeat tone when dealing with the potential rapists in the movie (obviously we don't see Nina's personality but based on Cass' description, she fits). She didn't think she could achieve ""systematic changes"", Cass just wanted to make everyone understand and feel her (Nina's) pain.",kkbeha
glieev0,I completely agree with this. The ending left me feeling hopeless and nauseous. The complete and nihilistic boiling down of Cassandra’s character to her revenge plot to the point of her murder really felt like a disservice. She completely disregards any attempts at systemic change and focuses on isolated revenges. I don’t know how male audiences may have interpreted the movie but as women it was completely unhelpful and honestly disheartening,kkbeha
gm7e9ms,"I don't think a Jhon wick fantasy revenge would benefit victims, I know it wouldn't benefit me. 

And I think it wasn't a happy ending, nor a ending that made viewers feel good. And that, is the whole point, they could have made a simple movie about how justice got served and Cassie triumphed and viewers would have gone to their houses satisfied and forget about it. Instead they choose to make viewer uncomfortable. 

It wasn't a pretty bow, and not everybody got away. The police didn't just saved up the day, they got a tip, a very serious tip from a respectable lawyer, they just did a regular job, search the area, arrest the suspect. The movie didn't glorify the police.

Finally why do we hold movies to the standard of always be giving a message, and always a correct one? I'm sorry but not at any point the movie says anyone has to die to get jjustice, because it's just telling Cassie story. It's not a guide to how to defeat rapists. She could never have gotten justice for her friend, so she tried to do it on her own. She knew she was risking her life. But she did not plan on dying.",kkbeha

Out of curiosity, was Cassie a likable character to anyone? I guess all lead characters don't need to be, but at least offer something else; interesting dialogue, new ideas, nuanced characters...

The most interesting moment was the twist of Ryan being a rape apologist. He lacked the moral conviction to recognize that rape was occurring and to stand against it. He looked around, saw that his buddies were ok with it, and went right along. In my opinion many people would behave as Ryan did, which is why the message is important. But please... next time please write something a little more nuanced.",kkbeha

gnqa8vm,"The point that she's not actually killing them is that she made them understand how she felt. Because once they realize she's sober and they're drunker than her they actually felt the fear that their victims would feel, and couldn't rationalize to themselves that they were just nice men and the girl real didn't *mind* after all. 

It fits well with the psychological themes. Al didn't kill Nina, Nina was different after wards and killed herself. Cassie can't make someone understand that with murder, she can make them understand that feeling when she makes them live with fear afterwards. 

> But, even then, what did she accomplish by throwing her entire life away?

I think that's kind of the point. If you're after revenge, dig two graves? That the responsible parties get arrested is in some part to keep it from being wholly depressing. But she stopped being the same person after Nina...and she's almost punishing herself. She didn't want anything other than this, and there was only one thing she allowed herself to want and that was ruined for her. 

>All of Ryan's transgressions were in the past, so what impact do Cassie's texts have on him? 

His professional reputation. Don't have to go to jail to not be able to find work as a pediatric surgeon. But also the statute of limitations for sex crimes in Ohio is 20 years. It's only been seven years in the movie. He can still go to prison for it.

She wasn't a heartless psycho like those people that hurt Nina in different ways. She just wanted to give a taste of their own medicine by not actually hurting them. She was a smart woman after all. She just had been through so much. Her best friend since childhood was raped and she blamed herself for not being there for her. She never got justice and eventually died while all those people responsible just lived their lives in peace without any consequences for their actions. So, she goes and tries to somewhat teach these ""nice guys"" a lesson, since that's the best she could do living in a society that doesn't believe women in such incidents. especially when the accused guy is a rich white man with a bright future.

She tried to get better after meeting Ryan. She was disappointed to see that even he was responsible for Nina's r\*pe. She lost hope and even knowingly walked to her own death. She was probably suicidal at that point, so she wanted her death to at least lead to frat boys' arrest and exposing all of them including Ryan (btw, I have no idea who this Bo Burnham was until this movie, but you seemed very focused on him for some reason.).

It would have been way too unrealistic if she was a serial killer going after a bunch of r\*pey ""nice"" guys. For me as a woman, that ending was somewhat comforting. I wouldn't be able to sleep if she just dies in vain. I skipped the entire scene where Al was smothering her.",kkbeha

Her only way out of the private hell she built for herself was by martydom. And it was all fucking brilliant. For me, I was thinking that the mail to the lawyer and the scheduled messaging was a fail-safe *if* she were to die. Cassie is obviously very ""shrewd"" (as she calls Nina), the fluffy handcuffs on a cheap ass headboard was obviously not fully thought out. She glimpsed the self-preservatoin of the rapist, and used it to complete her martyrdom. 

In a word, she walked into that house on a suicide mission, knowing full well that what we are made to believe she is about to do would have done fucking nothing for her cause, and would only have perpetuated the lack of justice.

I also disagree that the characters were caricatures and that the males were portrayed as evil. The Al character actually came across as very likeable if you didn't know what he had done.

gjhdflp,"SPOILERS AHEAD:

Why does there have to be a likable male character? This is her story and it is telling it from her perspective and experiences. Someone that *is* likeable did something bad. This is why I disagree!

The movie is making a point that it is easy to dismiss and forget others pain until it happens to you. I may be wromg but I'm also gleaming you may feel it was heavy handed because of how she carried out her acts of revenge. She just wanted her friends life and trauma to be acknowledged. No one believed her and if they did it was an inconvience and her story was snuffed out. 

She lacked pretense. She didn’t try to fool anyone once the jig was up. She asked hard questions that made you confront yourself in ways only the judge had been able to do. And even that was after a psychotic breakdown. The movie is the way it is to show how the stories go, women don't get justice or believed most time until after their death. 

Also there were no nice men because she wasn't luring ""nice men"". Nice men wouldnt have put her in the situations they did. Honestly, you can make the arguement the moment they come up to her, her point is validated. They see prey, a target. The first guy's friends were all talk but notice how he tried to take a vocal moral high ground yet still was the one to approach her and went for the low hanging fruit. The perceived ""nice guy"" out of the 3 was simply the one to act first and even made it seem to his friends that ""no I don't have the same intentions as you 2, I am just concerned"".

Bob the best man even said ""you killed a stripper at you bachelor party? What a cliche"". Why is that a cliche? Ask yourself, would her getting violent revenge as told in most typical revenge-porn thrillers not be heavy handed? Would it have made more sense to you because we are used to several cliches of either justified violence or women being murdered? As soon as he said that I felt a knot because he was right. How many times are sex workers and strippers portrayed as things to kill, bodies to harm or dissposable just so the story can have a deeth that furthers another characters actions? I immediatly thought of all the movies and games where killing strippers or attacking and luring sex workers is the crux or default for victims OR just even a side plot or something to do with no in game or movie consequence because these women are framed as ""disposable"".

Violence against women is so easy and acceptable in a sense because we are used to it. Sex and violence are pervasive parts of pop culture now that is even easier to consume passively. I feel people act like because women have rights now there is no inequality. Women have literally had rights for barely over a century when you think about it. Some countries have just barely outlawed rape within the past 2 decades. Doesn't that sound alarming?

This question makes me think ""what would i do if i was confronted with all the evidence that my friend is a murderer and predator"". We all say what we'd likely do but what happens when it's someone you love? When you all have a lot to loose- as in both of you, will you risk honesty or will you try to avoid consequences since you know you may likely get away with it knowing other people have when they *were* guilty or even when they were not. The odds are just too good at times for some to resist, enter Bob, Al's enabling friend.

Ryan, Al and Bob all show what people say all the time. We tell women ""you shouldnt have been drunk"" just listen to the the deans responses or the men at the beginning. We have all heard or read people express these thoughts, ESPECIALLY on the internet. Can anyone truthfully deny this?

Ryan represents again a likable guy. He IS a likeable guy. He has skills, charisma, intelligence and seemingly has grown in some aspects that he knows how to handle social cues maturely (i.e. he was rejected but tried again without pushiness, he made a move because they seeminly did vibe but then when he saw her discomfort pulled back in ways we would like people to maybe pause when we are in situationswe don't want to further. All this setup trying to signal to us ""FINALLY a nice guy"". But that's the thing he exemplifies- nice people *can* do horrible things. He was implied to be a witness and he couldnt own up to that. That is what she wanted as we see when she forgives the judge for not lying but everyone else goes straight to denial, genuinely forgot because ""why should they care?"" Or feigned ignorance in hopes she'd not keep pushing forward with blunt truths.

Bob and Al represent what people with privilage do. Lots of people have privilage in different ways. To be clear, she planned on assaulting him and I feel she set him up for this logical conclusion. She had to have known her actions would have consequences as well even if she never did anything truly extreme before that point. Bob coodles Al in what you can't tell is love or desperation to not have the friend of their victims body found. She really played 4D chess. She knew they would avoid accountablity or at least took the biggest gambit on it. However, it paid off because it showed they rather commit other atrocities to cover up their previous atrocitoes to maintain their peace. While Nina couldn't even get acknowledgement.

Yes people lie in these situations sometimes, but as Al said ""it's every guys worse nightmare to be acxused of something like that"" KNOWING FULL WELL HE DID DO IT! He is acknowledging he is scared of the consequences of his actions so even in what is a genuinely friegthening moment because now he is in a vulnerable position (not justifying or validating this action to be clear again) and still has hope that he can come out on top without any problems for him in the future.

I know that was long but I feel you had voiced what you didnt like well and I wanted to explain why I disagree. Regardless of our opinions, I feel this movie challenges the viewer simply the way Cassie did the entire movie. Confronted with the truth, in your comforts what truths are you willing to reveal for justice for someone else, even if it inconviences you (the dean for examole was in a neutral place were she very well could have helped, especially as a woman in power and someone you would expect to be sympathetic to Nina's plight... like she was once it was her daughter).

I feel it's a disservice to call this movie heavy handed when it really does just make the viewer question themselves without pretense or niceities.

I love what Cassie does in the movie she never reacts or show her vulnersbility or entertains what she sees as disingenuous, ""nice"" behavior for the pretense of sex. Someone even mentioned it in another comment. The shared an anecdote over how he heard his college friends get women drunk to sleep with them.

Why do men feel safer and more comfortable having sex with women when intoxicated? Notice when they think she's drunk they don't care if she wants to have sex they just want her to stroke their ego. Or simply let them fuck. Why don't we say more and more ""teach men to communicate and ask about sex and to consciously make efforts to not prey on people drunk"" vs. ""She was drunk and asking for it"". Yes there is personal accountability, yes there are predators but why do we questions the victims of predators or discredit them when it's too much work and accept that ""predators exist"" instead of actively trying to vilify that mentality. This movie wants you to be real with yourself and hold your friends accountable when they do stupid or malicious shit.",kkbeha

Ryan, Madison, the Dean, the lawyer, the other guys at the party and the cabin... at any point, someone could have stood up and said enough. No one did. They all enabled that ending through their choices. Maybe if just one of them had done the right thing or spoken up, both Cassie and Nina would still be alive.",kkbeha
gocuqe6,"> What is the point of including any of that? 

The way I interpreted it, the point was psychological warfare. These men thought they were ""good guys"" and that the sex was going to be consensual. But when they were confronted by a sober Cassie, they were forced to confront the fact that they were about to rape someone who was not able to consent. I think for Cassie, giving men a sobering dose of reality is enough. For example, in the opening sequence when the construction workers verbally harass her, she just stands there staring them out until they finally get so uncomfortable that they need to walk away. In many ways, I see this as quite empowering. The mentality of ""yes I am here and I refuse to take this abuse lying down. I am a human being that you need to deal with.""",kkbeha

She feels like a fuck-up who has made a terrible mistake. And think about Nina. Does anyone believe Nina would be anything but horrified at what Cassie is doing on her behalf?

She’s not being limited by the creator. She’s expressing a much more realistic, though still fantasy, revenge journey than the stereotypical kickass “my rape made me stronger” revenge movies that predates this one. Those are often a spit in the face to actual survivors because rape isn’t and shouldn’t be portrayed as the source of a person’s newfound strength. 

The men she targets aren’t violent rapists. They’re cowardly predators who convince themselves they’ve done nothing wrong. Still Cassie knows she’s putting herself in potentially dangerous situations, she just doesn’t care, and the guys she targets are the kind to be affected by someone straight up calling them out because they’re the “good guys” and stripping away that veneer is not something they can easily handle or be okay with. 

Also, she’s not “centering herself in her friend’s assault” she’s coping (albeit poorly) with her own trauma of taking care of her friend who was raped and then committed suicide. That shit is traumatic for the people around them too ya know. The whole experience tainted her view of the world and of men, how Nina’s family feels about it doesn’t matter because it’s about Cassie’s journey, her emotions and reactions. 

She dies in the end because her plan was always dangerous and she was practically doomed from the get go, especially after the Ryan Reveal. The ending of her death and him getting arrested isn’t supposed to make you feel good or like she won, that’s literally the whole point of it. It’s also part of why her death scene was so quiet and excruciatingly (and accurately) long.

It's abundantly clear she's not on a mission to make the world a better place. She is traumatized and on path of self destruction. She's not doing what she's doing for the good of all women. She's doing it for Nina. She's trying to cope with what happened.",kkbeha

I think the other questions were answered pretty well. For this one, I think that a lot of these guys don't necessarily think of what they are doing as wrong. They think they are just having sex with someone who is maybe a little drunk and it's ok because they are drunk too, etc. But obviously, it is wrong and they are taking advantage of a very drunk person. So her kind of confronting them in this jarring way does put a lot of fear into them in that moment.

There is no real satisfactory payoff so people need to go out into their own lives and work to change rape culture in order to feel any sort of sense of satisfaction to the story. If Cassie successfully saw justice through, the message wouldn't be as honest. It's a movie that's meant to make you feel frustrated because the subject matter is very real and out there and needs to be highlighted",kkbeha

I assume I’m supposed to just think they get sent to jail forever and that’s the “happy” part of the ending. But making the assumption that justice will be carried out, even with circumstantial evidence, is exactly what the story is using as the cautionary tale.

I can watch any standard revenge thriller and leave feeling good and satisfied, and then I'll probably never think about it again. I **can't** stop thinking about this movie. 

I think when many people say the ending is realistic, they are referring more to Cassie's ultimate fate. Her luck ran out as soon as she turned to violence, and that's very realistic indeed. And that was intended to be the original ending, but the financiers were wary of having the movie end on a completely bleak note. So yeah, they did tack on a tiny bit of hope. I don't think the ending suggests Al won't skate. It's nowhere near that optimistic, which is why I'm still so fucked up by it over a week after watching it.

As to how the police knew who to arrest, I would expect the lawyer to be the answer. True, Cassie only asked him to turn the video over to the cops, but I can't imagine he wouldn't want to go the extra mile and direct the police to look at the original rape allegations against Al. Explain how Cassie visited him recently in regards to Nina's case. Tell them that the only reason he has the video to turn over is because Cassie gave it to him with instructions to turn it over if she didn't return from the bachelor party. All this would make Al a strong suspect in her disappearance, more than enough to at least pick him up for questioning sooner rather than later. Full on arresting him at the wedding is a bit of a stretch, I suppose. But then again, Cassie goes down fighting and manages to scratch Al's neck, likely getting some of his DNA under her fingernails. I don't know how viable a sample they can get from her burned body, but Joe and Al seem like just the guys to screw up completely destroying the evidence. We aren't told how much of an investigation there was of Nina's case, but if the police got involved they may have Al's DNA already on file to match it to, giving them what they need to arrest him. It is still goofy, though.

* He if the ending played out differently, then she would have just gone to jail and be known as ""that crazy bitch"". Who drugged a whole group of people and then mutilated someone over a years old allegation. 

Even the plot with Ryan requires a bit of contrivance.

* Madison, who was mostly uninvolved in the matter just happened to keep a recording of a 7 year old video that was extremely incriminating.  A video that was both circulated among the friend group but Cassie had no knowledge of.

guxt5jy,"The Dean and Madison got those “punishments” because they played a direct part in what came after Nina’s assault, eg didn’t believe her and took Al’s side.   That doesn’t make her behaviour right, and the director and Carey Mulligan have made it pretty clear they are not encouraging this behaviour. Cassie is grieving and furious and was doing what SHE thought was right. The guys that Cassie went home with from bars and clubs didn’t get the same treatment because it wasn’t personal for her. She was hoping to make these men realise what they did and hopefully change their behaviour. In terms of the long smothering scene, that was done on purpose because that’s how long it really takes to smother someone, which you don’t often see in other films. It shows that Al knew what he was doing - he had a whole two and a half minutes to realise what was going to happen and stop himself. Not to mention this was the most realistic ending - Cassie couldn’t have realistically overpowered him once he got free from the handcuffs. You’re not meant to feel good at the end of this movie, it’s supposed to be thought provoking.",kkbeha
gwshbgt,"I think you're focusing on gender too much. Yes, a culture that condones violence against women means that women have a disadvantage and men have an advantage, but it's important to understand this isn't a man vs. woman battle. It's an abusers vs. victims battle, and that means that Madison and Walker are deserving of psychological torment as much as the men, while Cassie's dad is compassionate and a ""victim"" indirectly of losing his daughter emotionally for years, being even more understanding than her own mother, despite being a man, and the lawyer while committing past mistakes, is also a sympathetic character. 

Also, Cassie is cunning and manipulative, and at the same type a true hero who uses it only for good. I don't agree with some people's take that she's ""sociopathic"" when she's never tried to do any harm to people except for the end/destroy someone's car. All she's done is staged a drama and made people learn. She could have killed all those men and raped and killed Madison and that girl- but she wasn't actually out for revenge.

Think about it- ""I brought a drunk girl home and she wasn't drunk."" ""I drank too much and my friend put me into bed safely, but didn't answer my calls for days.""

She wasn't out to hurt people who the sake of hurting them. It wasn't torture, just very well planned and ingenious.",kkbeha
gvqj394,"I completely agree with you. I think this movie is really obvious about all the of the themes it attempts to explore and it's very surface level. People keep praising how she went after the Dean and Maddison, and it's true that women are complicit in rape culture  but the way its depicted in the movie is really shallow. It never really asks why women are complicit in rape culture. Was the Dean beholden to higher ups that wanted her to brush everything under the rug? Did the dean herself hold slut shaming and sexist ideals as a result of her bringing? Did Maddison feel uncomfortable with the video in the moment but felt pressured to laugh along with her male friends? These factors don't absolve them of their shitty actions, but the dean thought her daughter was kidnapped and Maddison thought she was assaulted for 3 weeks. For three weeks she was probably blaming herself, worried about her marriage, ashamed, and angry. And who's to say she would even believe Cassie when the latter said ""don't worry, nothing happened."" Why should she believe her? Cassie so quickly forgives the lawyer who arguably did WAY more harm to victims of sexual assault and rape. Like who gives a shit that he feels guilty? He should feel guilty, and who is Cassie to forgive him? Her forgiveness doesn't really change anything. He just pushed his guilt onto her. If he represents the justice system, why should we have any trust in him? The fear that Madison and the Dean felt was way stronger than the fear Cassie instilled in any of the men in the movie.

It's a bit more complicated than this. Indeed, the writer/director planned for the movie to end right after the burning of Cassie. Al and Joe get away with it; it's the disturbingly cynical(and realistic) ending you speak of. The financiers got cold feet at such a bleak, hopeless ending so the bittersweet ending was tacked on.

The thing about Ryan though that made his character so upsetting and harmful but so realistic is that he is not a sociopath. He is so many men that we are ok excusing because they are all those things you mentioned. They are so close to being great but when faced with the chance to do the right thing, they turn a blind eye and easily justify their actions. These men are walking around everywhere and maybe they aren't the ones raping or murdering but they are complicit and harmful in ways that we may never see which is even scarier in a way. We see Ryan as a good person until we really know him, unlike Al who even Ryan, a friend, has negative things to say about. Like people who really know Al know that he is a dick. I think what the movie is showing is that it's the Ryan's we need to be raising differently and that we need to be holding accountable.

2) The most important point of the 2 points — the “nice” guys that always bring her home always tell her how pretty and beautiful she is. And yet she does not have this goddess, movie star face. She smears her lipstick in the mirror before going out. These men don’t actually care she’s beautiful or conscious. If she were too beautiful, then I think those scenes of her standing up to those men, like McLovin’, wouldn’t have been as powerful.

The way that you are framing this is really coming across as minimizing rape. It really is reading like you're implying ""it would have been more effective if the crime was something *actually* serious, like murder."" Maybe that's not your intention, but that's what's coming across. And I think one of the points of the film is that trauma can essentially be a slow murder, as the trauma of that night led to Nina's and eventually Cassandra's deaths. Cassandra was basically already dead inside but just needed that one final push. She was stuck in time and constantly digging at her wounds and putting herself in danger over and over again.

The police were inept and oblivious. They were portrayed as completely useless until the last moment. They were quite satisfied to write off Cassie's disappearance as an unstable girl who probably killed herself. 

The police were portrayed to not give a shit about rape victims. They didn't start doing their job until a crime landed on their lap that they couldn't ignore -- a murder. Cassie did all the legwork for them. 

You can bet they won't go out of their way to be hard on the murderer or his accomplices. They will probably even get a light sentence. Ryan will probably face no consequences for lying to the police. 

You have to ignore a heck of a lot of context in order to interpet the ending as pro-police.",kkbeha

gyjjr2k,"I noticed this!!! Here are what I believe to be the other hints that Burnham was not a good guy:

He pressured her into the first date. She turns him down (AFTER giving him a fake number, as if that wasn’t clear enough) and he just begs and pleads “oh please I can’t stop thinking about you just one dinner that’s all”.

He makes a strange comment about her looking like a child & hoping no one thinks he’s kissing a child and that he always worries people will think he’s kissing a child. This is especially strange since he’s a paediatrician. 

(I took this more as an implication that he likes young women or women who appear/act childlike in some way, which is acceptable & common sadly in society. I don’t think it was meant to imply he was a paedophile.)

Then he “coincidentally” leads her to his apartment and invites her up for a drink. (Trying to subtly manipulate the date into a situation where sex might happen instead of outright asking if she would like to go over to his place.) 

He then makes a false half-hearted offer to drive her home instead, but really he’s lost interest in spending more time with her that night when it’s clear sex won’t be happening.

Makes digs about Cassie wanting to sleep around after seeing her leave the bar with that guy, because he’s jealous she won’t sleep with him. 

If they’d only been on a few dates and weren’t exclusive or even partners yet, she wouldn’t actually be doing anything wrong by having a drunken hook-up if she wanted to. He makes sure to clarify it’s “fine” she doesn’t want to sleep with him, but it’s only fine if she also doesn’t want to sleep with anyone else. 

Calls her a “miserable asshole” or something when asking her out to dinner again and says “shut up you stupid bitch” when saying he loves her.  But I think these bits only become suspect when his true character is revealed, it is possible to talk to a partner this way jokingly. But she never says something like “no you shut up you stupid dick” in return so it’s one-sided.

And obviously when he mentions oh he just CAN’T get rid of his old med school friends, showing he isn’t actually any more mature or different than they are. And then this is confirmed with the video. 

Also he must’ve known Nina dropped out and killed herself after that night and that her and Cassie were friends, that Cassie dropped out at the same time, but acts ignorant about *why on earth* Cassie didn’t med school. 

And it seemed just a little bit off the way he instructed her “do NOT leave” when at the doctors office. I love this scene because there’s the tension part when he says he’s gonna brush off a dying leukaemia patient to take her out to dinner, and then OH THANK GOD he’s just joking haha, but then makes a strange “DONT. GO. ANYWHERE.” instruction to her, which can be read as cute or creepy. Cassie goes with cute. 

I love their relationship, I relate so strongly to dating someone who maybe sometimes says things that are just a *little bit* off, but brushing them off because he’s such a good guy, surely it didn’t mean anything when he’s such a good guy. 

Oh he’s a doctor he helps kids my parents love him he likes Paris Hilton, so what if he done something a bit manipulative and underhanded on the first date to try and have sex. So what if he made a strange remark about me looking like a child. So what if he got jealous I was with another guy, I mean, I would be jealous too, right??

&#x200B;

The real heartbreaking moment for me was with the detective. Not only were Ryan's actions disappointing, it was heartbreaking to see how obviously suspicious he was behaving and the DETECTIVE who was investigating her disappearance just not catching on at all. It kind of felt like he was seeing what Ryan did for a living and just assumed Ryan was everything he presented to be.

gmsjn59,"I think the challenging thing about Bo though is that he ISN'T a bad dude. He's not a bad person per se, but he is complicit. Those are different things on the granular level. 

However I think the movie is saying that at the end of the day, the consequences of simple complicity, even if you're not the one actively doing harm, can be catastrophic. And that not actively doing harm and actively doing good are two separate things.

And I think when it comes to Bo's character is something the movie wants us to grapple with. He's not a bad person. And that makes everything that happens worse.

The silver lining in all this is that the movie isn't saying there is no redemption for people like Bo. Objectively, the lawyer is worse in almost every aspect--he wasn't just complicit, he actively participated in horrible things happening to Nina and Cassie. But he actually reflected on it and understood exactly why the things he did were wrong. And he clearly meant his apology as well, because I think the way the movie framed it, he didn't need to go the extra mile of actually following through on Cassie's wishes on the package. But he clearly did. 

He did what Bo couldn't, even though the video evidence  digs back up all the horrible things the lawyer did just like it would for Bo. And the lawyer wasn't fired--he was just on sabbatical. The actions he did would reveal things that threatened his career just like it would for Bo. But he did the right thing all the same because he actually understood what the consequences of his actions were for people like Nina.",kkbeha
gl26ujy,"This is an interesting comment.

One, because I have dated “nice guys” like that, and two, because I may unknowingly have given too much credit to “nice enough” men, when I should have been able to see their dangerous behaviours towards other people and also to myself. It was a punch to the gut to watch this film, and I mean that as a compliment.

gmsmi35,"Ngl, I think there were also some red flags with Ryan like not sitting down with her and really asking how she's doing or trying more to find out what happened that night when he saw her at that bar, or not really trying that hard to really get to know Cassie--but the 'stupid bitch' lines and the the other comments he's made were not red flags at all.

Those are all things that are ok for some people if they're comfortable with each other, and don't really say anything about him as a character except that he's got an awkward sense of humor. At that point in the movie, we repeatedly see him try very hard to respect Cassie's boundaries and read her responses to things and respond to them respectfully (like when he realized something was wrong when he invited her to his apartment).

He was kind of pushy with how he asked her out, though I'd argue the way it was framed, he actually asked her out BECAUSE she spit in his coffee. 

Also, it's important to point out that after Cassie showed up at his place to apologize, he wasn't particular bitter of spiteful about what happened, just hurt and sad.

And I say all this not to defend his character, but the particular brand of harm Ryan does should be separated from the kind of harm a lot of the other men in the film represent. Ryan is more insidious. He's a person who's actually good at reading people, actually knows what right and wrong is in a way that is more than superficial, and then still chooses to do the wrong thing out of convenience or chooses to go along with the easy way that benefits himself, even when that means other people get hurt.

Sure, in the movie we as an audience knew Cassie was already dead when the detective was in Ryan's office, but Ryan had no real way to know that. For all he knew, she was in danger but still alive, and he could have helped the police save her life. But he didn't do anything because direct action to help Cassie would have threatened his own personal career.

This reframes all the good things he did before in the movie into: he was a good person only when it was easy for him to be. He never pushed on Cassie's walls a little more even when they became really close because having those tough conversations would have been uncomfortable and could have gone badly for him, even though he could tell Cassie had personal trauma and things she wasn't saying. He could tell when she wasn't herself, but then never revisits those things later down the road. He wasn't a good person who sought out chances to do good, he was someone who thought all you needed to do to be a good person was to not directly harm anyone himself.",kkbeha

Do you think Cassie views her transgressions w/the same level of judgment?  Maybe the big difference is that Ryan could've stopped the incident from happening.  AB's character couldn't, but she could've turned Allen et al in to campus & police.  That would've meant her overcoming tremendous peer pressure and judgement by her circle of friends, probably losing her friends, and facing scrutiny from police, defense attys if it went to trial, etc (another reason the film needed to be made- another reminder of how fucked the 'he said/she said' system is, as well as campuses addressing these types of crimes internally, etc).",kkbeha

Those closing hours are so dangerous for women like her character — perhaps left sitting alone while the friends are on the dance floor or have already left, while all the guys at the bar start surveying their “options” with a diminishing amount of time left on the clock.  Especially with everyone being tourists — no one knows anyone, no one is from there, and everyone is looking to do things that they wouldn’t do at home.  And with liquor involved, judgement is even more clouded.  

No doubt a lot of those people in the film felt like they really *are* the good guy (and in comparison to some of the “bad guys” they absolutely are... but they still did the awful thing and aren’t immune from repercussions just because they don’t spend their day being awful too).  Shit, I think of myself as a good guy too (and I’ve never done anything like what is seen in the movie — I’m more of a cab caller for intoxicated people, personally).

As if I were culpable just for sitting in silence watching the film, as opposed to running out of the theater to tell someone... ***anyone***.   

I plan on going back to see this a second time as I’m sure I’ll pick up on more, but it’s one of those films where nothing will ever be as good as the first viewing due to how much it slaps the expression off your face and shocks you.

It showed the ripple effect really well. However having Cassies death come right after the speech about how it was always his name that hung around her friend afterward reminded me in a way of how murders always get the attention and their victims are always forgotten. That's what left the sour taste for me knowing that her death is now essentially his story, because her story is over.

In this world men are taught to follow a “code”, or follow unwritten rules between men. Women are disposable, and power is infinite. This movie made me hate my husband for a minute.. just for being a man. He is a good guy, but statistically he can’t be blameless (micro aggressions, blind eye, etc who knows).

That’s the only shitty part about the movie. Can this change, can society change, or is this forever. When is it change and  what/how much is forgivable. Cassie did forgive the lawyer, but only after true remorse, it took a complete reset/psychotic breakdown for him to see the true horrors of the system.",kkbeha
gt5w2w1,i kinda agree it’s supposed to be comedic in a way,kkbeha
gjlo8ft,"I agree, and I also think she might have had a plan B based on his reaction. Every person she visited, she gave them a chance to show remorse or offer an apology. The only one that did was the lawyer, and so she forgave him and made him an ally. She repeatedly gave them all opportunities to talk and explain, but instead of showing remorse, they showed defensiveness, excuses, and blamed her for being unstable or a psycho. She told Al something along the lines of, I want you to tell me what you did to her. If he would have done that and shown some sincere remorse, maybe she would have given him some other options and maybe even, to some degree, forgiven him. But sadly, everyone except for the lawyer showed her that they are completely self centered and only show empathy to the victim when it affects them or when they become the victim themselves. But yes, she’s clearly far too intelligent to make a mistake in the handcuffs. She probably didn’t know EXACTLY how it was all going to go down, but she was ready to go down with the ship.",kkbeha

gjl3ec8,Same! Similar to Gran Torino she needed the smoking gun to make sure that Nina got justice,kkbeha
gjnc1sn,">Beyond that... while it is deeply disturbing that her response to her friend getting raped and subsequently committing suicide is to go out and get raped and assaulted every week for who knows how long, only to write some names in a little book and do nothing else (like what is her end game? is she just running an experiment? is this amateur sociology? or just masochism?) and that speaks to some possible serious psychological problems on her part, it’s equally disturbing that we as the audience can watch that and go, what a relief at least it didn’t go too far! I think I need to just sit for a minute with, not just how fucked up that premise actually is, but how desensitized we the audience must be to find it so benign.

You're so right about this and I honestly kind of wish the movie explored her pain and grief more than it did. At the very end I felt satisfied? Not hollow? Cassie got her revenge but she had to die to get it and the gravity of that didn't register for me.",kkbeha

if the video alone wasnt enough and she needed to die. Then it makes it rather more complicated as the police would question why was she there to begin with and what was her intentions. 
Also she needed to die cause if she survived she would be the one getting arrested since she is the one planning the ""assault"" on Al meanwhile self defense.

gromq95,"Another reason I don't think she went there to die is because she's very willing to forgive. She's desperate to be rid of some of her anger, so when the lawyer breaks down and shows genuine remorse for his part, Cassie is able to not only forgive him but trust him enough to place her entire contingency plan in his hands.  In the end, all she wants from the people she confronts is the truth. An admission that they did something wrong. I don't know that the relationship with Ryan could ever continue after she saw the video, but if he'd admitted that he was wrong and not just made bullshit excuses, Cassie might have ended it with him on better terms. 

So, I've gotta believe that when she went to the cabin, part of her was hoping Al would give her what she truly desired, the truth. A reason for her to finally be able to let go of some of the anger towards him. And when he wouldn't do that, yeah, maybe she did decide to provoke him into doing something the legal consequences of which he would be unable to avoid.",kkbeha

gjfs83s,"This is how I interpreted it as well. I think Cassie realized that she had already been consumed by the loss of Nina. There was no “going back to normal” or “moving on” for her, she had already lost herself in the same way that Nina did following her assault. And while Al Monroe was at the center of it all, I don’t think Cassie was determined to get him thrown in jail. I think she ultimately wanted his life to be derailed just like Nina’s. 

Thinking about it now, if Cassie was really determined to get back at Al for what he had done, she probably could have sought him out long before the events of the film. But it wasn’t until Ryan brought him up that Cassie was suddenly hellbent on getting revenge, specifically when it was revealed that Al was back in town getting married. Cuz although he was a monster for what he did, it was the fact that he went on to get everything he could ever want that upset her. He was marrying a model. He had become a successful anesthesiologist. He had even graduated magma cum laude. His life turned out to be amazing while Nina’s had ended before it could even start. 

The real goal was never to get Al arrested for his crimes. It was to ruin his life just as he had done to Nina. While he may not be charged with Cassie’s murder, he would probably be charged with rape at the very least. His wife would probably leave him. He would most likely lose his job and tarnish his career. Any chance at new relationships or jobs would be thwarted by a quick Google search (thereby implying that he would be haunted by his own name, just like Nina had been). He would no longer be the “promising young man” that he was destined to be. And to Cassie, that’s probably a lot more satisfying than him rotting in a jail cell.",kkbeha

ghicw5l,"In real life, the worst is that they spend 5 years in jail, and then move to Phoenix and sell health supplements. Or move to Baja and run an illegal cosmetic surgery office. The prison of their own making has sex workers and blow. 

But if they're on probation, maybe they are forced to move and become car salesmen and switch to drunk divorcees in dive bars who don't ask any question. 

As a revenge film, it doesn't explore the cost of revenge on Cassie in a Count of Monte Christo novel, nor does it fully satisfy the comeuppance the abusers deserved. 

It was trying so hard to push fear into a certain archetype, and to increase fear of them, that it destroyed the complexity of the character of everyone. The target demographic who have experience real abuse are so focused on their own pain, that the fact they had to change the ending shows the message here is muddled. 

Cassie didn't get the last laugh, I guess you can say this is a modern Medea story where she sacrifices herself to teach men a lesson, but instead of ripping their hearts out and ruining everything they love, she makes the bastards feel like victims of circumstance in the end. 

It seems like mostly the point of the movie is to get men and women to fear each other more.",kkbeha

It really got me thinking about the night between all of them and Nina. The same sort of thing where individuals are talked into it from other guys too scared to do it themselves happened in the beginning too.

I don't view that as weird or red-flaggy at all. He really likes the girl, wasn't rude or creepy. He was just trying to be charming and friendly.

This is kinda how it was done when I was younger, lol. I'm not even that old. You flirted with people. You chatted with them. Finally you worked up the nerve to ask them out.

And hey, the movie as released already depressed the hell out of me, so I'll take the slightly comforting lie suggested by the final twist.

Well, the police are looking for Cassies body, and if Ryan has some integrity he should confess that she was planning to go to the bachelor party, also there is that letter she sends to the lawyer, so Al has everything against him, even tho he is a rich white man, its pretty hard to imagine he is going to get away with it.

gk3z9f0,"full disclosure, I'm a guy (I assume from your phrasing that might not have been clear, so just putting that out there) -- following up on what you said, I think the movie does a really phenomenal job highlighting the way that the view of coercing women into sex with substances (alcohol or drugs) has changed over time and especially the last 20-30 years or so (and even shorter than that with MeToo specifically), and also how people tend to view sexual and physical violence as being on two different levels morality-wise. 

It speaks to those points in the scenes with stuff like Cassie visits the Dean as well as when Cassie gets taken home by guys in general and plied with even more alcohol or drugs while seemingly already being drunk, as if her baseline of already being drunk suddenly means she's capable of giving consent since she accepts more of their booze once she's in their homes. The latter point I think is highlighted with the way people often react seriously to physical violence, not even questioning if a woman ""deserved"" to have it inflicted on them before getting upset about something like that happening, versus with sexual violence where there's often so much concern for the abuser before even thinking about the victim (seen in the movie with all the talk of abusers being ""good people"" and that they were ""just drunk"" or ""having a good time"", and that people like Nina were ""asking for it"" or ""enjoyed it at the time""). There's also the fact that the two types of violence are considered two separate things, when Al murdering Cassie demonstrates that someone willing to inflict sexual violence can be just as willing to inflict physical violence -- they're intertwined, not separate. The movie really does a great job of highlighting that while we've come a long way in treating consent more seriously, we still have a very long way to go as well.

I'm sure this all sounds like the kind of fake woke garbage from the nice guys in the movie, but Promising Young Woman has really stuck in my craw since I watched it earlier this week and your response made me think of this stuff. Really a fantastically well-made movie, sad that I feel like it will somewhat be pigeonholed as a ""woman movie"" when part of what I love about it so much is exactly *how much* seeing that woman's perspective made me think about this stuff in a way I rarely would in my own day-to-day life, simply because I was born a man.",kkbeha

Irreversible. 

A movie you struggle to watch once, but then have to watch again..., then never again. One of my TOP movies of all time and I’ve only stomached the emotions to watch it twice. 

This movie feels like a revenge to that movie. 

Maybe an idea for a double billing art house showing.

edit; I had this thought after watching Promising Young Woman, that scene in the bedroom in the end.. it was uncomfortable but you didn't know how it was going to end... is that the most harrowing scene in that movie?  There's a scene in Irreversible, 2/3s of the way through, that's just.. painful to watch. 

I ask myself how I had to stop Irreversible in that scene, but I didn't feel the need to in Promising Young Woman. Is it the cinematic experience and general tone.. or is it being a consumer of a shit ton of media... Both scenes showed struggle and that long, Long, long uncomfortable reality. 

Murder (promising young women) was easier to stomach than rape (irreversible)?

My interpretation isn't so much that she initially had a plan to take this type of man down or even jar them into better behavior. She is unable to move forward with her life from the trauma of what happened to Nina (and how the world responded) and giving these men a little scare feels almost like a coping mechanism for her (an unhealthy one, to be sure).

Cassie as 4 and Al as 5 makes perfect sense to me. She's never forgiven herself for not being there to save Nina, and this is her reckoning. And her punishments for each person fit the crime.

cassie didnt go in to make herself a martyr, but she knew those people and that situation was dangerous.

I find the two films very similar in how neither of them actually explores the themes in depth, only uses them to create a kind of sarcastic dark tension. But that doesn't mean Get Out has no depth, it has a lot of it in the way it portrays its characters, their motivations, fears etc. Similarly, I think PYW has a lot of depth in how it portrays the instability of Cassie, or how her demise (while maybe not the most reasonable or thematically helpful outcome) basically puts Nina's rapists in the same position they abused a long ago (I mean you have a house full of drunk men and a dead stripper, what is the jury going to think). PYW has a lot of depth in my opinion, and it's a lot smarter than people give it credit for.

Edit: I have to add that I absolutely adore her relationship with Ryan.

I feel like that's genuinely an important thing to show in a movie like this.  But anytime it comes up you see comments like this that say 'but it happens to men too' or 'but not all men are like that' or similar, and the people making them seem to fail to realize that's part of the problem.  Elsewhere on this thread I saw someone say they were thrown by Ryan saying ""shut up you stupid b*tch"" in the context he did and someone (presumably a guy) replied with ""oh no, I say that to my girlfriend and it's totally fine.""  In a thread about catcalling you'll see plenty of people there to say that lots of women like it.  Its literally everywhere that issues/things women deal with come up, and its not helpful.  Women should be able to talk about things that happen to them or bother them without having to qualify ""oh but men have it hard too.""  

A movie about a man who was sexually assaulted, not believed, and had their life derailed could really be interesting, but that's not what this movie is and thats absolutely fine.

gjzmtmx,"For me it's moreso how he handled it that made it seem much more creepy and pressure-y than a spontaneous fun moment, which it could have been. He could have pulled off the latter by presenting it as being ""Hey look we're passing my apartment on the way to yours, want to stop in for a drink before I take you home?"" -- That's an observation that leaves any pre-existing notions out of the invitation being planned, and also reassures her of his good intentions once they're done (while still leaving her the opportunity to *not* just ""go home"" after if she wants).

Instead, he presents it by trying to be cute but instead coming off badly by saying ""What a coincidence, I took us down a route to end up at my place, want to go in and have a drink?"" A subtle difference, but this comes off way more creepy IMO because it makes it seem like he planned the entire walk to end up at his apartment so he could force her inside, rather than being a spontaneous moment of fun like my example (even if it was a calculated route to cross his place in that instance too).

I agree with you that inviting someone in for a drink after a first date isn't a bad thing, and I think that's what great about the scene is that *he makes it bad and reveals himself a bit with the shitty way that he does it*. I've done a bit similar to my example multiple times in my dating life and had it go well, but I would never expect joking about plotting to bring someone to my house to fuck would make a woman feel safe.",kkbeha

She also almost paid a guy outside the lawyer's house to rape (or be some sort of violent to him), but changed her mind when the guy was sincerely remorseful. even if the guys she pays only \*pretend\* to be rapists like with Alison Brie's character (not even clear if that was true or not), that is still pretty violent",kkbeha

She might not care about repercussions but who is the random dude in a suit willing to make a woman think she got raped by him and deal with her going to the police? It was just convenient that all she did was call Cassies phone. 

The movie was all over the place. Long interactions with her parents that led nowhere - not even as a way to show us some backstory or an understanding of where Cassie is emotionally or physiologically.

I would argue the lawyer isn't actually a good person but has just had a breakdown when he realised the misery he's caused by doing his job (which he probably did 100s of times before that). The dad on the other hand I suppose is actually the only genuine nice male in the film although he has maybe 5 minutes of total screen time. But is he ""good"" or is he being a loving father as most fathers would be? The latter doesn't necessarily mean the former. You don't get to see enough of him to really make that judgement even if this was the intention. 

Regardless I don't think those characters really depict what I was trying to get at. Cassandra is obsessed with catching predators as a way of revenge and/or protecting other women and I think it may have been an interesting insight into her character to see how she would react to an actual nice guy who gets her home safely.

And the only reason why I care so much is because I was interested in this movie because it's my story in real life, I got raped while drunk and dropped out of med school. This movie just doesn't get it. For starter, life doesn't stop after rape. The protagonist keeps spouting the false idea that just because her friend was raped her suicide was inevitable and the only way to make it right is to stop rapists. There's actually a reality in which her friend could have been raped and not killed herself. Funny that's never explored. Anyway, the whole movie is stupid. Pretending to be drunk only to ""surprise"" men when she's alone with them. There's literally no point in that.

And the whole time he's screaming at her that it's her fault and to just stop moving. It definitely went beyond mere self defense. In that moment he wanted to kill her because even if he was able to fully restrain her and call the police to arrest her, she still had that tape. He couldn't let that tape get out. So she had to die.

That's the headspace he was in.  And afterwards, he had the whole night to sit there next to Cassie's dead body and think about what he'd done. He felt super guilty of murder. When Joe walks in and says it's not Al's fault, Al admits that it seems like it is. He FEELS like a murderer, so he's not rationally considering his chances of a successful self defense plea. And he's also still thinking about that tape. When the idea of covering up the killing of Cassie is brought up by Joe, he still has that tape on his mind. Maybe if Cassie is never found, that tape never gets out. If the cops get involved and Cassie's life gets looked into, maybe it gets found. Then there's the more superficial reason Al is thinking about. ""What about the wedding? That'll be postponed, if she'll even still want to marry me after this"". And he loves her dearly, so even that reasoning isn't so superficial. This could ruin the happy life with the woman he loves, no matter how justified the killing appeared to be.

And Joe not advocating for calling the cops? He was supposed to be ""that guy"" from all those movies where killing the stripper at the bachelor party is just wacky hijinks. Also, there was probably some other stuff going on at that cabin that Joe wouldn't want the cops to find out about. Illegal drugs, for one.

I'm not saying Al couldn't have successfully argued self defense and walked. I think he still had an excellent chance of arguing that even after the cover up is revealed, honestly. And the movie knows that. I don't think the ending of the movie is trying to be so optimistic as to say he definitely would have been convicted. If the movie wanted you to give that impression, they could have put in a shot of the prison bars closing on Al and Joe or show Al immediately breaking down and confessing at the altar.",kkbeha

If he wanted to invite her back to his apartment, then he could have just said, “We could go see a movie and then have drinks back at my place.” He chose not to do that, which is fine, but to “casually” walk by his place and invite her up seems very intentional. This immediately plants the seed of him being a shady guy.

gu3vgcb,"Honestly, it’s going to be extreme difficult to prove it was self defense especially considering the way they disposed of her body. Drugs like Rohypnol only stay in your system for 24 hours so there is no evidence of that and I’m sure they disposed of whatever tools she brought with her like they did everything else. But again, saying she was deranged and it was self defense may have worked if they had called the police. Saying I acted in self defense and then CUT HER BODY UP AND BURNED IT? Absolutely no way that does not look to a jury like a murder (especially considering that she had a video to blackmail him).",kkbeha

Yeah, Al's wedding might be ruined and he probably lost a ton of friends as a result of the tape leaking, but he's definitely not going to jail as a result of killing Cassie. The statute of limitations for rape is 25 years in the state of Ohio, so it's possible that the tape leaking might end up with Al in prison, but we don't really know the details of how far Nina's charges got and it might not be possible for him to be retried. Even if Al did go to prison as a result of the tape leaking, there is absolutely no reason for Cassie to have had to die to make that happen. 

Also, how the hell did Cassie know that she was going to die at the bachelor party? I feel like it's kind of ridiculous that she went as far as to mail letters in advance, send pre-scheduled messages, and everything in preparation for her going to the party. Like, the levels of ridiculousness of her plan parallels the Joker's plan in The Dark Knight. I just don't believe that it's possible.

EDIT: This is about a week after the original post but I had a conversation with a friend about this and he brought up the fact that Al would almost certainly be charged with tampering with evidence for burning Cassie's body.

All that I can believe. The part where the video is blackmail in retrospect doesn't make sense. Nobody gave a shit then, why would they now? You're right that people make excuses for bad behavior even if the evidence is there. The problem is that there's no reason those excuses wouldn't continue to work to keep them out of trouble today like they did back then.

Ugh. Right, so this is where Madison stops making any sense as a character similar to anyone I’ve ever met. This rape is simultaneously serious enough to warrant hiring a criminal defense lawyer but trivial enough that video evidence of it meant nothing for ten years and was treated as a joke. Nobody seems to give a shit that this recording could have sent some of them to jail until Cassie points it out. They’re acting really stupid.

I know there are rape apologists out there. None of them that I’ve met have ever been so dead-set on letting people they don’t like get assaulted that they wouldn’t throw people they barely know all the way under the bus to save their own hide.

I also wish we maybe saw more of the lawyer then, or haven’t seen him at all. Or I wish I’d had any emotions watching that scene. I didn’t like his apology and her forgiveness, I just didn’t believe it. The man seemed to be doing fine.  Living in a gorgeous home and the remorse he had was pretty comical.

glhxh68,"Sure! I'm specifically thinking of intense revenge moves that cover that topic well - REALLY EXTREME disclaimer for the following movies: they are really difficult to watch - I go through phases where I love pushing my limits emotionally I guess so that is why I've seen a lot of horrific things. I guess writing this I'm realizing I've just seen a lot of (perhaps too many) intensely graphic movies about these topics, and Promising Young Woman never really went that far even though it kept implying it would...I know some people preferred that but perhaps I just think these topics sometimes fare better with an unflinching look into the violence they cause. I don't think a movie necessarily needs to be graphic to be effective (like the movie Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Always is an extremely subtle movie with potentially hinted at abuse that I think was extremely evocative and effective with its realism - but it's not like the movie PNW, it's not about revenge so it's not on the following list)

I'll start with female-centered ones but I have a few additional ones I want to mention, there are none precisely like PYW - and yes, I'm very picky about these kinds of films so won't be listing typical slasher/horror rape-revenge movies because I don't tend to like those and they can come off as exploitative when done wrong: 

**The Nightingale** (additional warning: contains one of the most graphic, horrific scenes I've ever seen in a movie) this is a New Zealand film set in the 19th century made by the director of the Babadook (Jennifer Kent), though I think it's a bit too long and it definitely has a few flaws - it's a really moving film about revenge and overcoming the worst things that could ever happen to you (I guess living after a significant part of you has died, I think PNW was trying to show this as well)...it also has a very unique relationship develop between the protagonist and an aboriginal man who is helping her on her mission. I think I just prefer films that cover these topics that feel viscerally intensely -real- and for whatever reason PYW didn't do that for me (it did for other people though, so I believe something in my brain just didn't click)


**Lady Vengeance**: mentioning this again to write about it more, the entire Vengeance trilogy is worth watching...this is about sexual exploitation, child-murder and a lot of other intense shit...this is really bizarre, artsy, cerebral, graphic...I think it's brilliant. There are scenes in this movie that will make you feel so intensely repulsed, outraged, horrified, soul-crushed...I'm listing movies that just made me -feel- so much more than PYW did. 

the following movies aren't necessarily about revenge or about rape (some are about one or the other), but I believe they explore themes that PNW tried to explore in a better way: 

**The Handmaiden** it's not really a rape-revenge movie at all (I just love this director who I keep listing haha and I believe there are certain themes that would appeal)... I love this movie because it subverts a lot of tropes and I'm going to be very vague because it's best going into it blind: but it definitely becomes a woman-empowerment/revenge kind of movie in some ways. there is a lot of objectification/dehumanization/sexualization of unwilling women and the film shows the woman's response to that feeling of imprisonment by the men around her and the expectations they place on her. 

**Fish Tank** really amazing British indie movie about a british teenager, her life in poverty with a fucked up mom, and how she deals with some abuse that happens to her (again, being vague) - extremely layered emotionally nuanced movie (this is a slow, subtle 'gritty realism' movie). this movie really isn't about revenge, it's about the psychological experience of abuse. The director, Andrea Arnold is really amazing at telling extremely human, incredibly real-feeling stories about women and I recommend everything she's done

**Jennifer's Body** yeah lol...throwing this in here for fun - I like this movie and it explores some of these topics actually pretty decently, and it goes for full camp/dark-comedy and I love it. definitely flawed but it's an interesting watch. 

this might be a strange mention because it's a relatively very small part of the movie, but I think the scenes in **The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo** dealing with this topic were well-executed revenge scenes and I was kind of waiting for some sense of those scenes in PYW but never got it. 

**I Saw the Devil** another Korean film.. this is male centered but I really would love a movie of equivalent quality that is woman-centered... it is about a man taking revenge for his fiance who is murdered by a serial killer...it was one of the most brutally honest, intense depictions of revenge and how the act of revenge eats away at one's soul...it's so good. A lot of Korean films do this 'revenge' genre really well. they explore it philosophically in a way I rarely seen done in Western films for some reason.

**Prisoners** also male-centered but one of the few Western films I've seen do it really well - another intense movie about revenge, again male-centered and not about rape (about child-kidnapping and some other things), but also explores the idea of revenge and presumption and the philosophical costs of revenge really well. I was disappointed that PYW didn't really explore those costs/the weight of her actions but this film definitely explores the consequences of the revenge-centered mind, and it has an excellent cast as well.


**Poetry** another Korean movie by one of my favorite directors (Lee Chang-Dong does really genuine -human- subtle films, like his most recent one Burning got some attention, he portrays the intimacy and subtlety of unique experiences so well - really hard to explain if you haven't seen them): this is about a grandmother who is raising her grandson, her grandson does something horrific to another girl...and the film is how the grandmother deals with that emotionally, she is suffering from forgetfulness and existential hollowness (the film is also about aging) and it explores her attempts to cope and find beauty in life amongst the horror/meaninglessness of some of the things she sees/feels. she is an 'indirect victim' meaning, she wasn't the one who was raped in the film, but she does suffer the reverberations of that action, and I've never seen another movie like it...he has another movie is also female-centered called Secret Sunshine about a woman dealing with a traumatic experience (not rape, but intense grief due to a traumatic loss), it's also amazing and definitely worth watching...it explores grief in a really realistic, intensely intimate way... these movies aren't about revenge, but they explore the psychological experience of trauma far better I think

last note on **Hard Candy** the protagonist of this movie reminds me most of PNW's protagonist in her goals - It's disturbing, it's creepy, it's weird... I just prefer this movie to PNW even though it's far more low-budget and relatively limited-in-scope because it actually delivers and the end satisfies me and it's pretty thought-provoking. interesting exploration of power dynamics and again, philosophical implications of revenge and abuse etc.

I understand your interpretation, and agree. My issue is that I don’t think audiences will get that. They will just see “bad guys lost.”

Completely aside from my personal opinions, I also thought the ending was pretty ridiculous. Her text message that happened at the perfect time, the police come to save the day. There was nothing edgy or interesting about this movie.

Given the subject matter, I think it would do well unless totally flopping. The fact that they couldn’t be more provocative or original was disappointing.

On an aside, one thing I really liked and thought was interesting, that I’m not sure if people are missing, was the obvious trauma response Cassie has in the way she dresses/lives. Picture of her and her friend are all from middle school, songs like Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, and her clothing style and hair are all from that time period. I know because I’m 29 myself!

gllx1h0,"I understand feeling that way given the ending, but for me, I think the line of ""completely disregards any attempts at systemic change and focuses on isolated revenges"" misses the broader point a bit -- for Cassie, her revenge was a coping mechanism of a woman self-destructing emotionally, rather than a grand attempt at systematic change. She's doing something incredibly dangerous for what usually amounts to a stern talking to and putting a bit of fear in the guy who takes her home. She's not trying to make any attempts at systemic change because the system is what failed her and Nina in the first place, and that's why she operates outside of it. (Personally, that's what makes the cops being the ones to neatly wrap everything up ring a *bit* hollow for me, but it didn't ruin the rest of the movie)

I get the frustration, but personally that's what made it such a beautiful character study to me -- despite all her calculation in how she handles her nights out as well as her broader plot to avenge Nina, ultimately Cassie is working towards self-destruction the entire movie with how dangerous her actions are.

Just lazy writing that suggests the author knows as much about the medical field as I do Canadian Geese, which is jack.

While I have had sexual assault experiences, I've never been in the situation I am very drunk and a guy is appearing to take advantage of that.

If they wanted to do unrealistic I think that can be done in a good way, and still explore subtle themes, but for some reason this did not do it for me. I found the writing and plot uneven, the characterization fanfiction-y.  
 For me, it is hard to believe all these men are predators and are very aware of their predation. I know some of those men exist but the movie presented almost all men as being like that. I also had a hard time viewing the characters as believable, the men did seem like tropes to be as villanous and rapey as possible. I'm not sure most men are as aware of their rapey behavior and instead justify it to themself, whereas these characters seemed to be very calculated about it and truly without conscience, whereas most men behaving badly flail between presenting themselves as confused victims in denial as the death throes of their entitlement and guilt lash against eachother. I also understand the concept of the revenge movie and could have found it satisfying, but the director in an interview talked about wanting to show what a real woman would do in that situation when it comes to her deciding not to kill the men, merely scare them a bit. I frankly just find it hard to believe a woman who had experience with sexual assault would knowingly put herself in that situation over and over at risk to her safety mere to say ""haha I'm not really drunk, don't do this again"". It just doesn't show the experiences i have of most women I know, dealing with rage, anger, shame, fear, terror, hyper sexualization or shaming of sexuality, poor or overly rigid boundaries post assault experience. I also am not sure the men would care she would suddenly be sober, they'd play it off like they're glad she's sober, say Oh you feel better, still try to have sex then, pressure her, and assault her forcibly or through pressure, or let her go but act like they never did anything wrong.

It’s also why the director choose not to show the video to audience. They don’t want us to make a decision.

And a man who's so deeply uncomfortable with that is kind of the point. Rapists don't *look* like anything.

 And this way some guy like Ryan will act like he's very caring up until his self interest is different...we've all seen that ""switch"" flip as you called it before. It's not that he's faking, it's that it was easy to be nice when it costs nothing.",kkbeha

My point was that the way the trailer was cut made it seem like she was preying on would-be rapists, when in fact all she does is scare them a little and add a tally mark to her notebook like a middle schooler with a bunch of crushes.

There was absolutely nothing complex or difficult to understand about the movie. Its themes — The self-destructive nature of vengeance, toxic masculinity, the superficiality of ""meet cute"" relationships — have been done in other, better movies ad nauseam. 

It's also kind of concerning that you refused to watch the only scene in the movie that shows what would happen to Cassie if one of the men she preyed on wasn't a coward. These men only take drunk women home because it's easy to a) prey on a woman who is inebriated and b) justify raping them when they can't object to what's happening to them. Her victims leading up to Al all back down when they realize she's sober. Al didn't. Either we're supposed to believe she's just been lucky up to this point, or we're supposed to accept that she intended for the handcuffs to come loose because dying was part of her plan.

Bo Burnham is literally one of the stars of the film. His relationship to Carey Mulligan's character is central to the plot. And, yes, it's important that his turn from rom-com dreamboat to sneering villain is so jarring. The scene where Cassie confronts him with the phone was the biggest offender. It's like the director thought audiences wouldn't understand the idea that someone who observes a rape and does nothing is just as guilty as the person committing the act unless they were beaten over the head with it.",kkbeha

I mean some would argue that the ratio of guys to girls *shouldn't* matter because it shouldn't be the default to assume that men will rape or harm girls.

I like your second point. 

I just felt like the director was rubbing salt in my wounds by a) saving the only on screen death scene for her, and it's a long, uncomfortable, up close and personal, awful shot (but also brilliantly executed) b) after the other guy comes in, they play the fucking scene for fucking laughs. From the performances, to the dialogue, it's all so ridiculous. and she's just there. dead. I've seen A LOT of fucked up shit in my 30 years of being a cinephile. But that scene was up there with the infamous red tunnel scene in Irreversible, not as explicit or graphic, but just how confronting, disgusting, infuriating, upsetting, ugly, and awful it is. But the more I've talked about it with others, and processed it, I'm close to giving it 5 stars. (currently it's at 4.5/5). I LOVE IT! But I hate it. It wasn't fair. It was like Funny Games all over again. But I love a writer/director and actress who is willing to go all the way and get that kind of reaction out of me. Because usually I feel nothing.

go4po0t,"I didn't feel cheated by the lack of revenge, I felt cheated by a half-measure of a story. She was not killing any of those guys she went home with, the film made it clear that she didn't kill Jerry (the red pen guy we see in the beginning) when she blows her cover in front of his friend later. So now I am left endlessly frustrated by a very plastic story. We have a protagonist with violent, antisocial tendencies. Her friend killed herself after falling victim to a rapist, so she goes out at night to exact proxy vengeance  Except she isn't doing anything to help anybody. These guys are not going to stop victimizing women just because they got surprised one night, and there's zero personal safety precautions that she displays. She may very well carry a pair of scissors around with her for defence, but as we see at the end she is clearly no match against sheer weight so really I see it as a glaring plot convenience that she never met any violence before the bachelor party. Honestly, if the film didn't fake us out on a serial killer like this I would have enjoyed the core plot much, much MUCH more.

It's not the lack of revenge violence that bothers me, far from it. What we have is a film that changes its mind every time it almost does something interesting. Like they have this wonderful, dark and amoral ending where our character doesn't get what she wanted. At that point, the movie finally held my attention. But then they reveal that she sent out all of this shit to people as a contingency, so she really did get what she wanted. It felt extremely cheap, I was so frustrated that I couldn't make it to the credits. 

And its funny, at this point I was thinking ""Why would she make a contingency plan like that when she's successfully murdered like 20 people?"" because I for some reason still thought that she was a serial killer at this point. Because that didn't make any sense. Then I went back through the film, did a bit of reading and realized that I had just wasted my fucking time.",kkbeha

The movie presented the actuality if someone would set out to make the criminals, if not get them punished for what they did, to realise what they've done and it's gravity, things can go all ways. She died or lived, that guy was never gonna pay for anything he did. Not to forget how excruciatingly painful sexual assault proceedings are, in spite of a fair verdict. Pain can never go away.

McLovin gets the blue pen, and his admission that he sucks and unwillingness to have sex with a passed out Cassie probably makes him closer to a good guy than Jerry, but not by much. We get nothing more than a brief, vague moment(in which we don't even see Cassie or the man, just hear them in voice over) of an encounter than ends with the red pen, so it's completely up to our imaginations what that pen means.

But if they left her there and told the police that she cuffed him to the bed and had a scalpel at his bare flesh, anyone would instinctively feel threatened by that situation. All she has to do is push a little too hard and various organs get punctured, and he dies. While I was watching the scene I hated the rapist's guts, but as soon as she put the knife to him I instinctively felt for the guy and thought ""Oh hell no, this isn't going to happen"". I was rooting for him to stop her. Maybe if she got a can of indelible ink and wrote the word on his body, or if she learned how to do tattoos and tattooed the name on his body, then he wouldn't have felt threatened.

But I always wonder what his alternative choice was in this? He still was partially handcuffed so it's not like he could run away. And he couldn't just hold her down without killing her for an entire night while his friends were passed out. He would get exhausted from keeping her pinned down and all she has to do is wait for him to drop his guard to break free. Eventually she would get free from him and resume torturing him again. Killing her really was the only reasonable option he could make from his point of view.

I'm just imagining if I was in his physical position I'd probably decide that the other person would have to be smothered as well. It honestly does seem like a legitimate use of self-defense. I only think he's getting arrested at the end for not reporting it to the police and disposing of her body himself thus hiding evidence. I just don't see him getting convicted for murder in that situation. He either had to kill her or she was going to get free and carve his chest like she planned. He didn't have a third option considering he was still partially restrained and help wouldn't come for hours when the others recovered from the drugs.",kkbeha

Ryan was shown to be a good guy throughout the whole film.  We only learn of his past later and there's nothing to indicate that he's still the same guy he was back then and plenty to indicate he changed.

I at least hoped he would have a change of heart once he was visited by the detective - that he would realize something terrible happened and tell them the truth about where she went.

Humans are layered and complicated and all of us, no matter how saintly we might appear on the surface, are capable of doing terrible things. We are all capable of making a choice, in the moment, that we know is wrong. 

Most rape victims are raped by someone known to them and trusted by them. AKA people they perceive as “good”. We need to stop thinking that people that we perceive as “good” aren’t capable of sexual assault and rape. They are. Rapists are rarely the monster in the bushes. They are most often otherwise “good” people. This mythology needs to end. 

We live in a rape culture, Ryan was representative of that (as were several other characters). And, to be frank, that is reality. 

I told mutual friends that my ex-boyfriend raped me, they believed me, but remained friends with him, never censured him in any way. They preferred to just not think about this uncomfortable information. 

Years later a guy I was seeing tried to sexually assault me (I managed to call the cops) and locked me inside his apartment. I had met him through my flatmates. I told them what he did, we had a long conversation about it. They both said they could see him doing something like that. And yet they remained friends with him, never said a word against him.

Good question, and I'm not offended by it. 

To put it simply, rape is any unwanted or non-consensual form of sexual contact involving penetration (not limited to the penis, but any form of penetration, really). Sexual assault is a broader term but involving any form of unwanted sexual contact, examples being someone grabbing you inappropriately in public or at work, or even at home, that you didn't give them permission or consent to do so. To unwanted spanking, groping, kissing, touching (in a sexual manner, not just like a person giving you a random hug, though I guess that could also fall under the umbrella if they forced it on you and you didn't want anyone touching you), but that did not involve actual penetrative sex.

I think as for why they never mentioned the words 'rape' or 'sexual assault' is because a) they didn't really need to, because through implication, and the video, and the title of the film (which is a play on what they called rapist Brock Turner in his defense, I believe, 'he is a promising young man, we can't destroy his future' or whateverthefuck), the audience was able to figure out what was being discussed, they didn't really need to spell it out for us b) whatever happened to her friend was so sexually, emotionally, and psychologically humiliating and traumatizing and ultimately what led to her death-- even if it was suicide, that it really didn't matter if it was labeled as 'rape' or 'sexual assault', all that matters is it happened, it destroyed her, and they didn't really need be throwing around what could be considered ""buzz words"" throughout all the dialogue. 

Side note, many shitty people like to think that 'sexual assault' is not 'as bad' as rape, they probably didn't want to use either word because these same individuals could easily watch the movie and say something like ""so all of this was over some sexual assault? she wasn't even raped? nonsense!"", when both 'rape' and 'sexual assault' can be equally traumatic and damaging. So it shouldn't even be included in the argument.",kkbeha

ghw1otv,"Alison Brie's character is, thru my eyes as a woman, very culpable in a way that can't be compared to Ryan's. Her culpability speaks to the way women make excuses for men, turn their backs on victims and choose to throw their weight behind a narrative in which girls who get raped make themselves vulnerable (by the way they dress or consume alcohol, etc) which allows characters like AB's to *not* have to face hard truths about the men in their lives.

I kind of took each ""relationship"" between Cassie and the guilty parties to represent microcosms of similarly problematic relationships between victims/survivors and society.
Victim vs. The Perpetrator (Cassie v. Al), Victim vs. Institutions (Cassie v. The Dean), victims vs. those in the victim's very own demographic (Cassie v. Alison Brie), victim vs. those who have suffered the exact same trauma (Cassie v. Nina's mom), victim vs. the patriarchy (Cassie v. Ryan). And, of course victim vs. Self (Cassie who needs to avenge/honour/stay loyal to Nina vs. Cassie who deserves to heal from this trauma and find happiness and healing.) 

Cassie vs the judicial system lost its teeth because the lawyer was ready to fall on his sword and admit culpability - perhaps the movie's message to the legal system is to make some mea culpas and find ways to do right by victims - no further damage is done when that happens.

Such an interesting movie with a lot to say.",kkbeha
gnde8ec,"Her character is extremely culpable. Ryan said Maddison was close with Nina and Cassie. For a women who has been assaulted, the fact that one of her best friend turns against her and doesn’t believe her feels like being assaulted all over again.",kkbeha
gtf6039,"I think AB’s character perfectly exemplifies the way a patriarchal rape-culture society creates an environment where women are dissuaded from supporting each other and are rewarded for looking the other way and going along with the status quo. AB’s blatant internalized misogyny was shocking, basically saying that if you sleep around a lot no one should feel bad if you get raped, like holy shit. 

So, yes, to an extent she is culpable, but also her character was a brilliant deconstruction of how society grooms us to think the way she does, against our best interests, and that’s not really her fault and takes effort to break out of. It’s not until she thinks she’s been assaulted that she “wakes up” and sees the light, and that’s a sad reality for a lot of women. What struck me was when she said something like “I can’t believe we all thought that was funny...” Shit girl I can’t believe ANYONE could think something like that is funny.",kkbeha
gvjo3xi,"I judged her character in a different way. Because she was absolutely complicit in what happened - she knew about it, she saw a video for Christ’s sake, and she did nothing.

For a woman to be so intensely misogynistic like that is hard to watch because it means that, at least to some extent, she doesn’t even respect herself.

Realistically almost all women have been sexually assaulted or harassed at least once in their life, and it’s all too common for women to fault themselves for those things despite being the victims. The victim blaming mentality is something that even some feminist women can fall into when it comes to their own experiences. So a part of me wondered if her character had been through something not as severe, but still bad, and then projected that mentality onto Nina because it was how she had dealt with it in her own situation. It’s toxic and horrible and I still hated her, don’t get me wrong, but it made me feel sad.",kkbeha

I don't really agree with this distinction. Another comment laid it out very eloquently:

>True, but for me what made the ending so horrifying is how it demonstrated that the line between “acceptable” violence and “real” violence is nonexistent. We’re conditioned as a society to believe that “date rape” is less violent than “actual rape,” but the ending makes it clear that such distinctions are a fantasy. Men who have the capacity to date rape are also capable of taking that violence one step farther... if a person feels entitled to someone enough to take their body without consent, it isn’t that much of a stretch to imagine that they would feel entitled to take their life as well.

ghtso0k,"I would say Cassie's mom was more passive-aggressive: the crying at Cassie's birthday breakfast and the suitcase for a birthday present all make Cassie's mom's suffering the centerpiece during the one time they discuss that all might not be right with Cassie's life. That scene was Cassie's mom saying ""something is wrong with you and you're cruel to cause me such pain - you need to move (on)."" Hardly open, supportive or compassionate. And that suitcase, again, really passive-aggressive. 

Nina's mom also presents a pretty sharp edge. It surprised me to a degree. Nina's mom doesn't want to reminisce about Nina, for one. That was jarring. She and Cassie are 4 sentences into a story about one of Nina's birthday parties and the mom just shuts it down. Not gently. She senses that the need to reminisce is about Cassie's pain but she admonishes Cassie for that pain and very quickly leaves her alone with it. She gives Cassie two choices: grieve alone or stop grieving, and the choices are presented with exasperation and rebuke. I was kind of stunned. 

The only way I could explain it to myself is that Nina's mom was, herself, still struggling with immense grief and had no comfort or guidance to give re: moving on. The aggressive pushing of Cassie away may have been Nina's mom refusing to save a drowning woman when she herself could barely keep her head above water. It's another indictment of society and how little we know of providing women/survivors with healing and solace after trauma. I suspect that if Nina's mom was truly on a path of healing and acceptance, she would have been a softer place for Cassie to land; had she found peace she wouldn't have fled in the face of someone sharing the loss of her daughter.

Both Cassie's mom and Nina's mom, to me, represent a degree of internalized misogyny that women experience. It's a glimpse into the phenomenon of women blaming other women for the pain they experience - a stance that says, ""we have no means of dealing with your pain so you'd best just move on/get over it.""We've adopted a stance that says trauma victims are a burden rather than anything else. And we resent them for that in much the same way the dean and the moms resent Cassie. 

The one woman in the film who faces Cassie's grief head-on and tries to love her thru it is Laverne Cox's character. And isn't that interesting?

Yeah that’s exactly it, because your thinking there is also his thinking. He probably thinks “oh I’m fine because I wasn’t the one who raped Nina” but he was an enabler.

For me, there was no backtracking on that reality. So the final 10 minute montage of this heightened feeling of justice was totally lost on me. I couldn't go back into that fantasy mode of thinking. A white doctor being taken away in handcuffs had no impact on me because I could only think of the sure reality of him serving minimal jail time or even community service for what he did. I wanted Nina to be scared all over his body, and the movie seemed to offer some alternative justice that just didn't jive with the verisimilitude in my opinion.

The director originally wanted to cut the movie after they burned the body. If they wanted to paint a real picture, it should have ended there. Either that, or give the audience  the revenge fantasy they want to see.

I agree that the film never indicated he will be found guilty. That was my issue. It went back to fantasy again, when we know how it would actually play out.

hpgb58n,"I agree with you regarding the characters intentions, but if someone has a weapon but have stopped coming at you (as Cassie had at that moment because she was dying), it's no longer self defense. She would have to be coming at him with the scalpel for him to use reasonable force to defend himself. There was a clear crossing over moment (she had dropped the scalpel and was becoming weak). You can see he then decides to keep going, likely for the reasons you already said. That's why I love that scene. It's so brutal but really gets people talking about motive, consequences and where the line is.

Slightly different scenario, but there have been cases of women killing their abusive husband's while he's sleeping. They claimed it was self defense (understandably), but unfortunately the law doesn't see it that way because he wasn't coming at her in that moment while he's asleep.

We instantly like him and want him to be good, to be the light that drags Cassandra from the darkness. We root for him because he seems to be saving our hero when she needs it most. And then bam!

Everyone shares in the blame. And at the end of the confrontation with Cassandra he shows that he’s still just worried about himself- that he is in jeopardy, that he is losing Cassandra- and doesn’t show real remorse for Nina and his role in it.

This movie wants you to question the lengths Cassie goes to achieve justice & begs the question “is it even worth it?” The unsatisfactory ending is purposeful.

No I get that, and I still really enjoyed the movie, I hate to be the person who's like ""why aren't there any characters that look like me?"", I just felt like the whole plot really demonized men in a way that felt in accurate, even the scenes with the women that were involved in the cover up really didn't get portrayed as being that bad, like Madison was legitimately awful, and yet she really didn't get any punishment even though she was just as complicit as everyone else, I also would have liked for them to dive deeper into how the victims are effected. But the point of the love was to portray men as being evil creepy monsters which I felt like was kinda unnecessary considering 99% people are not rapists, so why focus on that 1% to represent an entire gender. I wasn't trying to say that they shouldn't have focused on women, that wasn't my point, I just thought that having litterally every single male character in the movie (I'm not joking by the way every single male in the movie is portrayed as a creep or evil besides the lawyer who was evil, oh and the dad but he has like 5 scenes) was unnecessary.

The video wasn't shown to anyone when the incident happened. It's why Cassandra was so shocked when she watched the movie and it reveals that the guy she was dating was actually a bad person. No, it's a video of a bunch of guys openly taking advantage of a girl who is passed out at a party. I'm pretty sure the girl reporting it to the school and later committing suicide is enough indication it wasn't consensual. It was a bunch of douchebags sharing the video, not the police. I mean what? Your logic is all over the place. Go and enjoy what wedding? The one that was booked a week ago? If this happened in the real world the guy's entire life would be destroyed. Raped a girl in college, killed her friend looking to get revenge. You think you're hiring that guy? Just look around you even a whiff of sexual harassment and you're toast and this guy raped a girl and killed her best friend. And you think that shit is going to be swept under the rug? You're living in a fantasy land. Also one last thing since you're being so ridiculous...
""If someone tries to violently harm you or your family, you have the right to fight back to protect yourself. However, when your fighting back leads to the death of your attacker, you may be charged with a homicide. This can be scary for you if you were just trying to defend yourself against someone else's aggression. However, if you can prove in a court of law that the force you used was necessary to repel the aggression, you may not have to go to jail."" <--- I'm sure the guy would be out of jail in 48 hours and getting married after killing someone, l-fucking-o-fucking-l.",kkbeha
gjde2rj,">They don’t have to. The defense never has to prove anything since, you know, innocent until proven guilty and all. The job would lie with the prosecutor to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the knives WEREN’T hers. And good luck with that. No DA would ever even try to take that to trial, since it’s basically a guaranteed loss.

Did he have to kill her though? The police will come to find a dead girl on his bed with 15 other drunk men around her. Pretty convincing self-defense case indeed.

>Why? Because he was viciously attacked at his bachelor party? He had no reason at this point to think there’s a video that could leak, and he could pretty easily hand-waive the attack away as some psycho girl he went to school with seeking ill-placed revenge for the loss of her friend.

She actually did threaten to leak the video, so why would he think that it wouldn't be found. It's more ideal for him to get rid of her, rather than risk being convicted for the murder or having the video appear through an investigation. Self-defense or not he is still a murderer (and a rapist), and we can't know how his girl would react.",kkbeha

gjp7su6,"'She gets disrespected' in what way?  From whom?  Curious where you're getting this.

Edited to note that in an interview from this press tour she mentions having recently had 2 kids, (also assuming she took a small break from her career) so not only is she sent fewer scripts, she's more discerning with regards to what roles she wants to take, and how much time she's willing to spend away from her kids for a project.  

For women over 30, it's incredibly challenging to maintain career momentum in Hollywood.  There are always a million younger, prettier, hotter newer it-girl actresses ready to fill whatever void you've left to have a couple yrs of life outside of making back to back movies.  It's a testament to her skills that she's still making movies like PYW.  And I believe she had to sign on as a producer to help get the film greelit for production.  It's been a blacklist script for a few yrs, w/ EF waiting for a studio to finance it.",kkbeha

gkr6d1c,"It's not a judgment of the character just my analysis that the theme seemed to be that the systemic rape issue is destructive and harmful but fixating on revenge is a (self)destructive and response. 

When one thinks of a ""calling"" it's generally associated with fulfilling a role for a greater purpose spiritually/for society/the greater good etc. Nina's mother suggests that the way Cassie is living does nothing for Nina and it does nothing for Cassie, her parents and boss make similar assessments. I think the film most explicitly suggests this when she is about to go home with Jerry's friend and we learn that Jerry TOLD  his friends about his encounter with Cassie yet his friend is still preying on women at the nightclub. There we learn the futility of what she's been doing on a larger scale and on a personal scale, it clearly has not been an effective way to cope/grow/live as a person. If she were thriving while doing it it would be a completely different movie altogether (but I love those movies too).

 

>In superhero movies, when the cops roll in we celebrate it as a ""win""... Just saying.

In this movie, like real life, cops are part of the justice system that routinely fails victims of sexual assault. Feeling like Cassie won against Rape Culture because cops arrested Al (who wasn't even arrested for anything to do with rape) is hollow because what about the dozens of other people complicit or involved in Nina's rape?  Al certainly wasn't the only problem in this. What about the law firms that smear rape victims to defend rapists? What about the broader cultural issue of the university that enabled this incident? What about the book full of men who took Cassie home on one of her excursions and didn't change their behavior?  These are all specific examples of the broader rape culture problems in the film that are shown not to be solved by any one individual's quest for vengeance.",kkbeha
gkxz2lr,"I agree, I also find it very weird that people see in the story a comment or theme that Cassie’s need for revenge was a character flaw on her part. I interpreted the film as without criticism of her revenge drive, but instead demonstrative of the futility of it all. Pointlessness in a depressingly pervasive culture. 

And I think the bait and switch in the marketing is also fair enough. Attract a broader audience and hope to make an impact on people you may not have reached otherwise. I personally enjoyed the movie being more than I originally thought it was going to be. It was way more interesting and provocative than an unrealistic and gratuitous revenge fantasy. Hell, I have a very good friend, and he’s going in thinking it is a vicious slasher revenge film. I’m not telling him any different and I can’t wait to argue about it with him once he’s seen it. And you know what, if I told him more now, I’m sure he’d tell me he doesn’t need to be preached to, and then I doubt he’d see it. Anyway, hopefully he pleasantly surprises me.

I feel like PYM couldn't decide if it wanted to be a realistic, harrowing look at trauma in a society that blames victims of sexual assault or if it wanted to be a cheesy, schlocky revenge-thriller. Mulligan's performance and scenes like the one with Nina's mom made it feel realistic, but then it seemed to go full melodrama/revenge-thriller with scenes like the meetings with Alison Brie, the headmaster, and the lawyer. With those first two meetings, I thought the movie was gonna do down the route of being a cautionary tale of letting your trauma consume you. And then the scene with the lawyer wasn't realistic at all. Like since when do lawyers feel bad like that? That's what made me think it wanted to be pulpy.

First, we actively see her struggle with the decision. It's not like she was immediately like ""tee hee okay honest mistake"" and went up to his apartment. She was rightfully annoyed but then second-guessed herself. She genuinely liked him/was charmed by him and so I got the impression that she just really wanted to believe in him, after having been willing to blow him off at first. It seems to me that how she was living was understandably taking its toll on her, and part of her wanted a chance at some kind of connection.

We've seen through interactions with the other guys that she does give them credit for the nuances of their behaviour and is willing to forgive, so it's not like she is inflexible in her views. She gives guys opportunities to cross lines but she doesn't write them off until they do so. He did things that were iffy but not enough to firmly plant him into the creep category. 

I also think that part of it is him saying he had a crush on her in school, since we find out she didn't think highly of her appeal back then. It probably came across as a sign that he actually wasn't just after sex. Not to mention that he knew her name and seemed to care about her life, which again is a stark contrast to the guys she was regularly interacting with.

Hell for all we know 1st dude could have turned violent and she protected herself.

Didn't think it was a horrible film though, she's not Dexter who has a goal to murder every wrongdoer in town. Her main goal was her personal revenge against Al and she went and fucked with certain men in clubs as a way to scratch that vengeance itch. Maybe I'm filling in too many blanks for the writer but if she were to actually cause harm to those men it could've potentially gotten in the way of her ultimate goal.

These kinds of men probably don't have the balls to get physically violent, remember they're ""nice guys"".

The medschool guy who raped Nina would never describe himself as a rapist. His friends who watched him do it and are implied to have at least touched her unconscious body would never call themselves or him a rapist. Many of the students who saw the video wouldn’t, the dean wouldnt. The lawyer (at the time) was literally hired to keep Nina and any other victims silent. 

We live in a world where we’ll say rape is bad like it’s the boogeyman, but when confronted with the reality of rape and who the rapists actually are, society and power structures (schools, cops, even student communities) are destructive to the victims and protective of the rapists.

I think the movie did a fine job of saying what it intended to say. “Nice guys” are just wolves in sheep’s clothing. The moment a man’s image or career is at stake, a woman’s life or any harm done to her is instantly disposable and forgettable. And unfortunately, society reinforces this same power structure. “We can’t ruin that young man’s life over an *allegation*.” Instantly followed by silencing accusers instead of adequate investigations.",kkbeha

How is it concerning that i refused to watch a murder scene?!! I knew where it was going already.

Dying was a possibility. She was a small woman in a basically a frat house. Us women are well aware of our size and how that’s makes us vulnerable when you’re confronted by multiple men. The drugs could have not worked for longer than a few minutes and she would have been screwed. The handcuff weren’t cop level, so breaking them was a possibility. Believe me, my ex was a cop, the cuffs were so heavy and uncomfortable, that he realized they weren’t a good idea 30 seconds in😂Kinky sex toy handcuffs are in no way as strong as the real ones to hold a grown ass man down.

It was gut wrenching. And from a survivor’s perspective especially because her previous revenge plots are something we’ve all fantasized about. That conclusion just brings you back down to earth about how it truly was a fantasy- the cards are stacked against victims in so many ways. From rape culture to the system itself to the sheer unfairness of how men are just physically stronger (at least generally speaking). Cassie managed to triumph over some of those hurdles (rape culture with Madison, the system with the Dean) but in the end that last card of brute strength proved to be too much. It’s horrifyingly close to reality in that even if you manage to prevail against one or two or even three hurdles, the likelihood that you’ll prevail against all of them is more often than not, a fantasy. After all, only 1% of rapists ever see prison. 

It stung. Because I so wanted her to fucking beat the snot out of that guy, to carve him up like a Thanksgiving turkey and walk off into the sunset.

She tossed the notebook. It's probably at the dump. And no one knows it exists or has reason to believe it exists, so no one is actively looking for it. 

No one knows about the drunk traps, other than the men she trapped. Connecting Cassie to those outings isn't immediately obvious. It's a different business altogether from infiltrating a bachelor party. Are the men going to come forward? And then say what? ""She pretended to be drunk and then lectured me!"" It's embarrassing. I'm sure they'd rather not get involved. And again, when the police comb through her life, what links her to those encounters? I'd imagine not a whole lot.

Her ""history of violence"" is literally nothing but that singular incident with the tire iron, and there's no reason to think anyone knows that was her. Do you think the other driver got her license plate number? He sped off. What evidence is there that she did it? You're giving the police a hell of a lot of credit. 

All the evidence of her visit to the cabin? Do you not think Al and Joe got rid of as much of that as they could think of? Not much point in burning the body if you don't do that too. Depending on how they got rid of that stuff, I suppose some of it could be recovered. 

What she did with Madison and the Dean are the only things that are almost guaranteed to come out. And Madison might also rather not come forward either due to feeling bad about her part in what happened, or simply wanting to keep out of it.

Now if we are just supposed to guess (murder, violence, etc) okay...but then why show us two different scenes of her doing the same thing. 

The Mclovin scene he says ""I almost didnt go out tonight, I am so glad I did...why are you leaving now you just got here"". This doesnt make sense. 

Her smashing the truck window and the guy just sitting there. 

She tried to murder a guy with a house full of witnesses. Just tell the cops that. I mean shit, he was still handcuffed in the morning. What choice did he really have but to kill her?

Her plan at the end...why? Why not just email the video out? She was going to carve the name into him? And if that was her plan why didnt she give him the same knockout potion she gave everybody else?

In real life she would have real connections with people like Maddison and the Dean of her school, expecting them to be there for her as another person since they ""know"" her.

Unlike them, the lawyer is someone who she doesn't know but still played a roll in it and is actually apologetic and understands her. This is not unlike what would probably happen in real life. People who are perceived as being""unstable"" or ""mentally ill"" are gaslit more often. 

I think the way it portrayed the themes is brilliant because it highlights a dichotomy between her upbringing/ self awareness. We see the mother as a submissive ""airhead"" type and she probably holds some of this identity in herself and holds shame for it. This is likely why she is harder on the females and not males. This is real life and likely how some of these situations actually play out. I don't think the themes were too ""obvious"", they are deeper than people are willing to give it credit for.

If it's enough for Cassie to do all that, it's certainly enough for me to just go with it and not feel the need to see the video in order to be affected appropriately. 

Not only that, but not showing the video forces the viewer to actually ponder the situation without a solid picture of what actually went down, much like the dean from the earlier scene. When it's you confronted with this, do you trust that something devastating happened to this promising young woman, or do you sweep it under the rug because ""we gotta give these boys the benefit of the doubt"" and ""it's all he said, she said""? I think not showing the very convenient video helps get the viewer into the headspace needed to answer that question for themselves.

He 100% knew Al was a rapist, but continued on with their friendship like nothing happened.  Honestly, she wouldn't have blackmailed him if he had owned up or shown any kind of remorse, but because he jumped straight into excuse mode, that's where her patience ended.",kkbeha

I watched the movie so I could see the rapist get what they deserve. And to be honest, I think they all got off lightly.   
Cassie wasn't an angel, she committed crimes and hurt people. She was planning to cut Nina's name into the guy, not kill him. It's a revenge story. You aren't a saint for seeking revenge, but she was way more of a hero than the losers you were patting on the back in this movie.",kkbeha

gmtqr4h,"I agree with everything you say in your second paragraph. I also think it's a lot more succinct than that I said in my comment too

To me, Ryan is what happens when someone refuses or isn't aware of how bad rape culture is. 

I just believe the lesson here is to show people what happens when people look at rape culture and their only takeaway is ""well I wouldn't do something like that"", not realizing that if the CULTURE itself is toxic, you have to be proactive in fighting against it to even have a chance to be a ""good guy"". You can't just choose not to participate. You end up like Ryan, who is still complicit in every awful thing that happens. He was also nearly complicit in Cassie getting hurt at the bar when he just left her there with the creep without checking on her, so he could totally have been complicit in her getting assaulted there too since he had no idea she wasn't drunk

But it's also that reason that ultimately, I can't indict Ryan's character as a bad dude for his worldview, only his actions. Same as Cassie. If I have to say Ryan is bad, I'd have to do the same to Cassie and I just have too much sympathy for her. Rape culture isn't a situation where things get better if I get rid of all the awful men and put Ryan among them. Ryan's the litmus test for me. He's someone who thinks as long as he lives his own life, doesn't personally involve himself in anything bad, then he can think of himself as a good person. The movie points to that and says 'no' that's a nice ideal but it's not possible. 

I think it's a bad takeaway to say Ryan was bad all along--I think that's not giving the movie enough credit. The movie rejects Ryan's world view and provides really good reasons on why he's wrong and how he could actually do better in the form of the lawyer character. It shows several instances where he could have redeemed himself and done the right thing, and he just didn't where the lawyer character did.

TW for victim blaming:

I think it also shows how the various characters in the movie minimise and dismiss what happened to Nina.

She wasn’t *raped*, she just got too drunk and had some unwanted sex and regretted it. 

Al isn’t a *rapist*, only *bad men* are *rapists*. He was just being a typical college kid. And anyway, he’s such a nice guy!

So, another reason for dancing around using those word is because the characters would have to admit something awful happened to Nina and none of them done anything about it.

When they had the dinner with her parents and Ryan, her dad says he missed Nina because she was like a daughter to him, but that he also missed Cassie, his real daughter.

I think it’s very clear that they cast stereotypically type-cast “good guys”  in all of the roles for a very specific reason.  Meaning that they played “good guys” in other movies (which is why I used quotes around that phrase).  And then the movie very clearly shows that these guys are capable of as terrible or worse actions than the people that ***they*** would consider to be “bad guys”.  As in, none of them likely saw themselves to be a bad person, yet all of them tried to do something unforgivable.  

I do think it’s worth pointing out that in the film, she keeps a color coded log to mark what happened the night before, because *she* is making a distinction between bad and worse actions.

However, even if every guy in the movie was portrayed as bad, that doesn't mean it's trying to say that all men are, it just chooses to focus on the bad ones for the purposes of it story and message about the different shades of rape culture complicity.

Comparing it to a similar type of movie (by that I mean dark comedy/thriller with a social mesage), Get Out makes white people look worse than PYW makes men look. Not one single white person in that movie is good or even redeemable. Yet it's not at all saying all white people are racist (Jordan Peele is even married to a white woman).

If anything, this movie is kind of making a statement about that exact kind of attitude. Jordan(the lawyer) even talks about people whose sole job was to find pictures on social media of people being drunk (making poor decisions) and using that to justify them getting assaulted.

And the way Cassie died is clearly meant to be visually similar to sexual assault. The literal circumstances are a bit ridiculous and extreme in the movie, but do you really think that Cassie making poor decisions and hurting other people means she deserves to die for it?

Cassie clearly doesn't think Al or any of the other people deserves to die for their actions.

I think the ending was trying to do the same thing as  “Get Out” with the idea that racism from police will be the end of the film but they make it uplifting as a last minute change because they are trying not to send that message to the community they are trying to serve. I think it’s a tricky line to walk between trying to hold society accountable while also uplifting survivors. While the ending may not have been entirely realistic, I think the film was aware of the backlash it would receive. They knew that if people could write Cassie off as violent, these people would write off the film and it would be preaching to the choir. For this reason, I think making Cassie go violent with the name carving would have jeopardized the whole film. On the other hand if they just ended with the body burning, they would be putting out the message that there is zero justice in the world, just like the original Get Out ending. This is impactful but completely diminishing to survivors. 

Maybe the film should have committed to one of the two original possible outcomes instead of tiptoeing the line between both in a way. I personally however feel that the ending provided some more catharsis over the original ending.

Al was thinking of himself and not the life he had taken away, which was what happened with Nina.

He was arrested for the murder and the hard evidence was there when we saw the cadaver dogs finding the burn pit. We don't know whether or not he's also on the hook for the rape. We assumed so since she sent the video to his lawyer, but it's still sort of up in the air since we don't actually get to see it. While we got justice for the murder, we still don't know whether or not we get justice for Nina's rape or if that's even possible. I think deep down, Cassie knew it's so much more harder to convict someone of rape than it is for something else so she went in with the intention of actually physically harming him (a first for her in the entire movie) and taking the risk of not ever leaving because that's the ""next best thing"".",kkbeha

No. Rarely do I pay attention to other people when I'm out drinking. Either too busy with my own group or too drunk to pay attention to what is going on around me.

Would you notice if it was a gritty guy in his fifties?

No. Same reason above.

The movie was pointing out how easy and frequent a situation can come up where a man can take advantage of a drunk woman for sex. The movie only showed attractive, young men taking the bait. It would have been refreshing if the movie would have shown a drunk old man take the bait to see if Cassie would have still pretended to be drunk to see if the drunk old man would go through with a sexual encounter to later drop the act and have a ""gotcha"" speech.",kkbeha

My issue then is that this movie wants to have its cake and eat it as well. There are essentially two movies here. The one in the beginning played for a false suspense then the one in the end that we were really here for. 

Compare this to a horror movie where you try to find out the murderer or something like that. 

Even better, if you have ever saw the break down of the movie ""Passengers"" about how the movie should have started with Jennifer Lawrence. We see here wake up, see Chris Pratt find her, and we have no idea what is going on. This would have created suspense about Chris Pratts character and would have made him seem creepy. Then later we sympathize with him as they show us his past. 

This movie has essentially the same issue. They reveal right away that the suspense of murder was just sort of bullshit. So when she got through the roman numerals you kind of already assume that she is not going to do anything really messed up. It seems out of character every time. 

For example her hiring that guy to pretend he raped that girl. Who was that guy? How do we know he didnt actually rape her? Why couldnt that guy be Jerry, or Mclovin? We can assume it was a previous guy who tried to rape her, but if you are going to show us multiple guys why not have them mean something.",kkbeha

It is different to your case example because unless it's one of those locked-in-the-basement scenarios, the wife could have gone up and left to seek help instead of killing the husband (mental restraints aside). She also was not actively being attacked since he was asleep. Alex *was* restrained, so no chance of escaping, and was in the process of being harmed.

It's a small change but here's my reasoning: As we saw with the ending, most untrained men could kill an untrained woman with one hand tied behind their backs.  When I think of trustworthiness that applies to a lot of things, and you could say the same statement about women.

You know what's not being said? How many men and young boys are often victims of sexual assault, sexual violence and rape.

The few time sit does get brought up, it usually comes with some form of dismissive comment that implies it doesn't happen enough for it to matter or be of concern, as if there's more significance or importance placed on female victims or female issues.

This tone is what's troubling about your comment, and is the reason why there will always be a divide on this subject. It doesn't matter if all men are rapists or not, what matters is the tone of these conversations, and how they are alienating many men (and women frankly-as I know a handful of women who are against the metoo nerrative). This isn't the way to raise concerns over issues and gain allies on important causes, this is how you divide people, hence why there's so much pushback against something everyone should be in agreement (and fundamentally is in agreement of). No one in America endorses rape. While victims are often mishandled, this isn't a gender based issue, it's mishandled for all genders who experience sexual trauma, male and female. No one wants rape to happen other than the people who commit these crimes and they are by far and large a fraction of a small percentile of the population.",kkbeha

Also doesn’t matter if no harm was intended, you still can’t take someone’s child without the parent knowing. This is true even if it’s another family member or friend.

I know you’re rooting for the protagonist, so am I, but she commits more than a couple of crimes in the movie, including kidnapping. She leaves Adam Brody’s (Jerry’s) apartment with blood on her hand. She’s not an innocent person. What happened to her friend has corrupted her to the point where she’s become the type of person who will commit crimes to right a wrong. That’s exactly what we like about the movie though, right?

I was responding to this message, because even if she's not in the room at the time (but again, the red tick marks? I don't know what those involved) she is still attempting to 'overpower'/threaten those men - there was a whole lot of implied violence by her, but it never went there in showing most of it... I'm pretty sure her reaction to the lawyer was due to his completely unexpected remorse - I mean, even in the first scene she had a guy completely on top of her and gets extremely close to men without being shaken at all and still mindfucking them, so she definitely seems emotionally prepared for that type of closeness...she just wasn't prepared for him not to be a dick, her motivations ran off anger and her desire for revenge, that's why she was shocked and didn't know what to do with the lawyer: It was an entirely new experience to see that kind of self-awareness and regret. 

and I don't think she paid men every single time to fuck people over, I feel like I can guarantee she was violent with men and she was being violent right before the end as well (also smashing a guy's car with a crow bar and threatening a dude with it isn't exactly 'nonviolent' either), again, the red tick marks imply she did something more herself and I think it detracted from the movie to only imply those things (in my personal opinion) - I just didn't agree with the comment I was responding to that she ""wasn't violent"" and it ""wasn't about overpowering men""",kkbeha

A very unrealistic representation of what victim's families deal with. A dean who blames girls and defend boys would not fear for her daughter's safety since she believes it's the girls' fault.

You criticize me for mentioning restraining Cassie and calling the police, but how exactly does Cassie live without this being the next step? Al outweighs Cassie by a hundred pounds and has a clear strength advantage, even with the use of only one arm.

He could relatively easily just sit on her chest all night until the guys wake up, and then have them call the cops, if he was open to letting her live.  But this isn't what Al does. He doubles down and intensifies his efforts to kill Cassie, even when she's fading away and becoming less and less of a threat with each passing second.

As I said, Al has a solid self defense argument, but it's clear that it went further than that for him in the moment. He's not thinking merely of survival. He gets angry and wants to kill her, for daring to accuse a nice guy like him of something horrible like, uh, you know, that r-word thing that's too horrible for him to even say out loud, and for threatening to ruin his life with a recording of that, uh, you know. Without that guilt over losing control and actively wanting to kill Cassie, why agree so quickly to the cover up?

Regardless, I welcome the discussion. Thank you for your input.",kkbeha

Yep. Throughout the movie, we see that simply admitting to your mistakes goes a long way with Cassie. She reverses her decision to sic a knee-smasher on Jordan because he is contrite, and he becomes the only person she trusts with any details of her crusade, even going so far as to place the success of her contingency plan squarely in his hands. One of the only people she was actively planning brutal violence against becomes a trusted ally, and all he had to do was admit wrongdoing and ask for forgiveness.

In reality I don't suppose much would come of it as he didn't commit a crime. And in the video he does seem critical of the situation, as opposed to everyone else. 

He did lie to the police officer and there would be repercussions for that. Would he be fired, though?

Edit: Ryan could have noped the fuck out of the situation or he could have intervened at any moment. The latter would have been equal to social suicide. Someone's already filming so the rape is being documented. Notice how practically all women also knew and did nothing (during or after). Why? Social suicide. Group think.

gm8bm1j,"Yep. I think in part Joe is the real villain in the story. From what we see of Al he’s clearly misguided and at fault as well, but Cassie alleges that Joe is the one who drugged Nina. 

Then we have Al seemingly saying several times including in privacy that he does not want to have sex or do anything with the stripper, and then after he kills Cassie he seems to at least be aware that being charged for murder is a possibility while Joe seemingly is dismissing Al of any responsibility. 

I think most people here are missing also that this is Cassie’s side of the story. The audience is never shown the video. Sex assault cases are extremely hard to charge when alcohol is involved for a reason.

I think the unprovoked shattering of the mans car is there to show that Cassie is unhinged and irrational at this point. No sane person would do that and her vendetta has taken over her life. Her decision making is impaired. That’s the point of that scene and also not showing the video to the audience.

This is a movie where the girl dresses up as a slut to seduce guys. The person who said she wasn't hot enough probably meant under this situation. Which I disagreed with..

Once again the SJWs are trying to take things out of context to ruin someone's career simply because they have nothing better to do or any skills or talent to try creating anything themselves.

gmt78r4,"I don’t mean to imply that she deserved to die. But I also did not like that she herself was doing bad things to people. I think the movie actually wants us to look at that and judge how we feel about the original atrocity vs the things that Cassie did. Cassie was bent on revenge, but it didn’t change anything. Her friend’s mom even said, “it’s time to let it go.” I think Cassie started her quest for honorable reasons but became consumed by her own rage and quest for justice. When one is raped, there is no justice. The victim lives with the fall out forever.

I guess my own feeling is that because of Cassie’s behavior, I felt less heartbroken when she died. It was very sad that she died, but her behavior was escalating to the point where the things she was doing were criminal herself. Not that she deserved it, but she took it too far. At what point does her crime become greater than the crime she is avenging? She herself was inflicting trauma and pain on other people. Whether or not she felt it was justified was irrelevant. She chose to play a dangerous game, and paid the ultimate price. I felt Cassie was on a path to self-destruction, and possibly beyond saving herself.

I agred that the 2nd trial for the rape would be harder for Al to walk free from. But with statute of limitations, he might not even be able to be arrested for that. And the trail would probably lead to only minimal jail time with the right lawyers.  Justice is broken for rape victims in the US.

It feels like this person is more likely to be willfully ignorant making bad faith arguments if they really think its unlikely that ""that many"" guys who are ""nice guys"" are rapists.  Its sadly much more common than people want to think, and  so is people sticking up for the rapist to the detriment of the victim.  

I always find it interesting when people (well, generally men) seem to get so frustrated when women speaking about rape don't go out of their way to exclude them from their criticism.

I said he could have incapacitated her to get the scalpel- that would be justified. He was not justified in killing her. To be incredibly clear: you are only legally justified in using the level of force being used against you. Cassie was not utilizing deadly force against Al, therefore Al was not legally justified in using deadly force against Cassie.

We can argue about how a jury would have found based on how Al’s lawyers would have presented the case, but Al knew Cassie didn’t want to kill him and wasn’t going to kill him. She was going to scratch Nina’s name into him and let him go on his way to explain that to his fiancée. Maybe he could have convinced a jury his life was in imminent danger and Cassie was using deadly force against him. But based on the facts that the movie actually gives us (she wasn’t going to and didn’t want to kill him, was going to scratch Nina into him) a self-defense claim would fail. Again, he could have cuffed her so she couldn’t scratch Nina into him but he 100% was not justified in killing her. The movie wants the audience to understand this was not self-defense.

The lawyers simply have to say that the trail is for the murder itself, not for what they did to the body afterward. Their client was ""scared"" and didn't know what to do. It happens all the time!

So maybe Al would get some time or community service, being charged on accounts of ""cadaver mutilation"" or something. Whatever the prosecutor would charge him for. But as for the murder trial and being charged for murder, it doesn't matter what the defense did to the body afterward. The jury would deliberate about the moment in the bedroom.

But he's not a ""victim"",he's a rapist so he a victim only if you have your blinkers on. The Bride is the villain of the Kill Bill series if you only see her murdering People and skippedcthe intro. Most slasher villains are nad cause the victims dont deserve to die(Freddu and Jason movies are great examples). 

>why was it treated as not a big deal?

Cause Madison didn't think it was big deal and that it was all consensual and therefore not evidence of rape. That suggests she think its a crime to begin with and she clearly did not. It would be slamdunk for Nina the victim.Everyome else just had to pick sides or sit on fences like Madison.Why nobody took her side is a great question but the movie suggests a culture of normalisation and apologise.



Murder does not have to deal with the subjective interpretation of consent which is what makes something rape. Murder is not rape.

It highlights how widespread the predatory behaviour is, with supposedly nice guys sick predators. I live in the UK but assuming there isn't some unexplained culture and judicial difference between the uk and the US the numbers should be fairly comparable. In the UK 99% of rape allegation don't lead to convictions.

I agree that the movie addresses a very specific societal issue, i.e, men assaulting women when they are drunk, and society not holding them responsible because of victim blaming and to avoid ruining the man's reputation. However every instance was very clear. One guy kissed/undressed her and took off her underwear. Another fingered her. Cassie did not get raped, because she was in a position to defend herself (was not drunk) and stopped them. It's not possible to say what would have happened if she hadn't stopped them, but it was definitely assault.

We see Joe chuck the wig onto the pyre. As I said, not much point in getting rid of the body only to hold on to all the rest. They want it to look like she left alive and well, or was never there at all. Whether they just threw the stuff in the garbage or were more thorough, that's a different matter. 

As for the suddenly sober snares, I really don't see them being brought to light at all. They seem designed perfectly to discourage and avoid notoriety. It's not that I believe McLovin wouldn't lie; I don't believe it ever gets to the point that he's put on the witness stand.

I simply don't see any scenario where, no matter how hard Al's defense digs into Cassie's life, they're able to reach the rather out of left field conclusion that she's been pretending to be drunk to rope fake nice guys into taking her home so she can flip the script and teach 'em a lesson. The plan is dead simple, requiring nothing but Cassie's iron will, a varied wardrobe, and a youtube history of makeup tutorials. Phone records, bank statements, questioning the all of 3 people Cassie has in her life, who were completely in the dark? None of that gets anywhere close to revealing what she was up to.

There's also no Legend of the Drunk-then-not-drunk Psycho spreading around town.

And while it isn’t all men, even a single man can hurt many women. And it is absolutely what’s happening today. 

Brock Turner was proven to have raped an unconscious schoolmate. There were witnesses, he was seen doing it. And the judge let him off the hook, because he didn’t want to “ruin his future.” What about the future of the woman he raped? Why does that not matter?

And this is why so many women don’t tell anyone. Even if they do, justice likely won’t be done. The sentencing for rape trials, even with PROOF like eye-witnesses, is disgustingly low. And this emboldens the awful men who do these things. They know nothing will happen to them.

And it’s hard for decent men to believe, men who’d never hurt a woman in their lives. But just because you wouldn’t doesn’t mean many others aren’t.

I think to a certain extent, if someone hasn't been taught how to react to a certain situation, they will often just go along with what most people are already doing in the room, which is to not stop the rape happening right in front of them, and then they'll spend the rest of their lives trying very hard to not think about what happened at all and their part in it.

But just trying to deny it makes you a piece of shit and a part of the problem. 1 in 4 women raped, means at least 1 in 4 men are rapists. Hope you’re not one of them but you probably are.",kkbeha

I’m think it would’ve been really interesting to have seen the film explore the legal aspects further, because there is also a huge societal issue of victims losing in court due to lack of evidence and then being labeled as a liar, a label that can often do more harm than the labels placed on any rapist. I choose to take a little more optimistic viewpoint mainly as a means of survival, but everyone definitely has very different experiences with such a huge issue. I won’t defend the film any further because it’s definitely just a matter of opinion and one film can in no way capture all the nuances and complexities of rape culture.

I read her performance in moments like when she's fucking up dude's truck, as her being very zen, almost dissociative for lack of a better word (she looks like her mind is elsewhere).

As for you saying I'm ""sticking up for rapists"" that is not at all the case. My point was that demonizing half the population creates unnecessary division. Not to mention it is the exact same ideology of fucking Nazis. Using 1 statistic, true or not, to define an entire group of people is the exact same thing that racists do to justify racism, so yeah, you are using the same Ideology as Nazis. As for the second part you couldn't be farther off, I am not frustrated at the fact that women speak out on rape, I think it is important because people who legitimately experience rape should be supported, my problem with this movie is that 2 male characters are not creeps or evil in the entire movie, thats not a joke, just her dad and the ex lawyer who used to be evil. So basically 1 male character in the entire 2hr movie, to say that that wasn't done to demonize men would be ridiculous. If I tried to tell you that rape isn't enabled in the main stream media I'd be lying, kobe bryant and Ben Roethlisberger are prime examples of that, but false accusations and the demonization of men are also enabled. Just look at what happened to Jhonny depp, or what didn't happen to Cardi B (who admitted to basically doing the same thing as Bill Cosby), and I could find 20 college athletes who had their lives destroyed by false accusations in a matter of minutes.

Then when she met with Madison then the Dean, she was still looking for that satisfaction but could never really find it.

“Do you want to go back to my place?” vs. “Oh hey, we just *happen* to be walking past my place! Do you wanna come up?” 

You talk about it not being shady or impolite to move towards sex, and you’re correct. The problem is that this move towards sex is closer to a trap than a question. He put her in a situation where the pressure was higher for her to say yes, and she’d feel guiltier for saying no. 

The further implication is: what happens if she says no? They were walking to a different destination, or they were just walking to walk and talk. Now, the context has changed because their initial agreed upon walk turned out to be a plan by Ryan. Is the date over if she says no? 

It’s not a cute romantic surprise. The surprise is that Ryan’s ulterior motive was sex, and he was *not* up front about it. He concealed it so that he could catch her off guard with the question at the right moment.

It’s all very “let me pressure you into sex until you finally say yes”, which goes along with his personality since he relentlessly asked her out until she said yes (and someone spitting in your coffee is a pretty clear deterrent, which he pushed right past).",kkbeha

Correct. 

> if you only see her murdering People and skippedcthe intro.

The movie skips her past as a hitwoman. She’s no better than they are, honestly. 

> Most slasher villains are nad cause the victims dont deserve to die

But as I Know What You Did Last Summer proves, that’s not a necessary element of being the horror villain. So disputing the characterization on those grounds doesn’t hold. 

> Cause Madison didn't think it was big deal and that it was all consensual and therefore not evidence of rape. That suggests she think its a crime to begin with and she clearly did not. 

Well regardless of what she thought, it was being investigated as one. 

> Why nobody took her side is a great question but the movie suggests a culture of normalisation and apologise.

But that only goes so far. My problem with this is that rape culture apologists still don’t want to go to jail for what they did, so if there’s a chance that this video is going to get them convicted, why the hell are they sharing it? You said yourself that it’s slam-dunk evidence for Nina. Hell, any video involving the girl who accused all the dudes of raping her wouldn’t be funny anymore.

It's not that we NEED to hear them talk about their careers, I just think having them do so in specific terms is what separates bland writing from something better. Does the audience need to be filled in on every detail about a character's life? Of course not. But when a character is written to have conversations in which she's mentioned to have been great at med school, when she's made to say things like, ""I always wanted to be a doctor"" you'd think the film would go the extra mile and maybe have her introduce some sedatives or something that seems exclusive to only what characters with her background (medicine) would be knowledgeable about. Yes, at the end of the film all she wants to do - apparently - is carve Nina's name into Al's chest, but aside from the fact she attempts to use a scalpel to do so....nothing about it screams ""Doctor"" or ""Med Student"" and in my opinion, that made the writing come across as weak and undeveloped/thin - she could've been written to have a background studying sociology, and her character would've been the exact same.

ghwmf82,"I disagree. The friend didn't just not support her, she flat out denied it happened, despite sharing the video around and apparently they would all laugh at it. She knew it happened, thought it was funny, and still tried to act like it didn't happen. She also had proof, which could have put the boys away, but she just held onto it as a joke, which is really disgusting. 

The dean admits she knew what happened and believed it was wrong, but still had to give the guys the 'benefit of the doubt'. She probably was allowed to look into it, but instead was payed off by the parents to shut up about it, which probably furthered her career as the dean in the first place. 

She also doesn't even do anything to these two women, she gets one of them really drunk, makes her think she slept with some guy she didn't, and she feels like shit about it and realizes how easy it is to get put into that situation. The dean she convinces she dropped her daughter off in the same room where it happened to her friend, with a bunch of drunk guys. But all she did was drive her to a diner convincing her that a boy band was about to show up. 

She also wasn't crying 'with him', it's extremely painful to forgive someone, but he was the only one who took accountability for it and seemed pretty tortured about it. He realized what he had done was wrong and asked for her forgiveness, he knew he could never change it, and it had ate him up seemingly the entire time, since the second he opens the door he says ""I was expecting you to show up"".  The other women were both hypocrites and never took accountability for anything. She got psychological revenge on them, proved her point, but didn't actually do anything to them. 

I'm also pretty sure she tortured or beat up the men instead of just saying 'you're a bad guy', after the Adam Brody scene she's covered in blood, but it's never shown what she did, true. There's also hints of violence in the other scenes as well. But they never go into detail, which makes the ending so shocking.

ghwjcez,"The whole point is that she wanted people to show remorse for what happened. Yeah, the friend and the Dean DID deserve that- nothing actually happened to them, they just got mind fucked a bit. If she had actually had the friend raped or dropped off the daughter with those boys it would have been fucked up. But all she did was mess with them in order to get them to change their perspective. The lawyer got off easy because he was genuinely remorseful and clearly tortured by what he had done, and Cassie was taken off guard because she hadn’t encountered anyone else who had shown actual regret. 

I thought it was brilliantly done, because it made the point that women can be just as shitty as men in propping up rape culture. If the friend had supported Nina and turned over the video to the cops, maybe Nina would still be alive. If the Dean and subsequently the school had believed her and taken action, maybe Nina would still be alive. They *absolutely* deserved what they got.

Edit: the cop who took my initial statement after I was raped and called me a liar was a woman. We don’t talk enough about how women can inflict incredible damage on sexual assault victims and I’m glad this movie pointed that out. Rape culture could not survive without being enabled by other women who are more than willing to throw survivors under the bus so they can enjoy the (limited) benefits of patriarchy. Reminds me of this quote I saw on twitter- “Women who carry water for the patriarchy just so they can have a longer leash and stand a few rungs up in oppression from other women make me a special kind of angry.

Even if you would bait someone, there is always 100% chance that the guy would carry on with it as well ? hell the deans daughter scenario that would 100% lead to a ""rape"". Says who ? The specific case of one subject in a theme thats not so really specific is my problem. I wont dumb down on the topic but the movie to my opinion just wasnt that great. Just cause i dont like 9/11 movies doesnt mean i dont think terrorism isnt real lol come on now. I find rape to be as random as getting shot dead on a party except this is specifically tied to male vs female. its something you just either cant know in advance, you dont see it in advance or you just dont want to know in advance as possibility because of other million reasons, trying to get more friends,guy, popularity and many many more. The problem is real but its just not only about rape tbh. This movie is tho and its one of the possibilites of what can go wrong in the real world. Thats how i take it but why should this be anything special over the other scenarios ? i think they all get covered equally as they do really happend.",kkbeha

But you also have 8 guys who saw her there who would be happy to testify for their friend. They saw everything she brought. They all drank the alcohol and all blacked out. Maybe they can take a toxicology test, or even test the drops of alcohol that spilled on the floor in the cabin. There is this thing called ""collecting evidence."" The cabin was a mess! You could easily find proof that she drugged them.  And then his best man, I am sure, would happily testify as a credible witness, explaining what he saw when he came upstairs. 

I've seen too many crime documentaries, listened to too many My Favorite Murder episodes, to think for one second that Al would be charged for murder for this. His defense lawyers would have a field day collecting all the evidence to point to a self defense plea. Maybe most would slip by, but even 1 piece would save Al. Hell, he might get off on his story alone with the right lawyers, and enough people saying she was acting ""irrational"" before that night. 

And you're telling me, with a notebook of about 100 people, every weekend finding a new guy, the defense couldn't find one credible witness willing to get ""revenge"" on the girl who fucked with them? Even if they never find out about her weekend hobby, they still have a solid case.

gmtzm9n,"I guess from my perspective I saw Cassie on an inevitable path to self-destruction. There was no “balance” in her life. She was miserable, and she was bent on revenge. She just couldn’t let it go. I hate to even say it, because it makes me seem unsympathetic, but she brought on her own death by what she did. Had she never shown up at that party and drugged dozens of people, tied this guy up (and from what I understand, was going to chop his dick off), she would still be alive. I mean, I understood Cassie’s motivations. But I didn’t feel some of her behaviors were ever justified. For example—I was fine with her taking the guys home and giving them lessons in consent. But to arrange to get the woman drunk and then make her believe she was raped? To essentially “kidnap” the Dean’s daughter and make her believe she was at risk of being raped? When she hired the guy to beat up the lawyer (which she then called off). Can that behavior ever be justified in the name of revenge? In my opinion.....no. At some point her crimes were becoming larger than what she was trying to “avenge.” Even the victim’s mother said, “let it go.” In some ways Cassie’s death was more of a suicide than a murder. She kept pushing and the crimes kept getting worse, none of it would ever make right what had happened.

I wanted to add that I am a victim of abuse, including sexual abuse. Never once have I ever considered revenge. Quite the opposite, the peace in my heart was achieved through forgiveness. When a person clings to anger and allows it to consume you, like Cassie did, it sets you on a path of destruction exactly like what happened to Cassie. One cannot move on with their life in peace if they cling to anger and the desire for revenge. A person who has been victimized deserves a chance to take that horrible event, make peace with the fact that it happened, and find a way to move on, to not let it define them, to not let it become who they are for the rest of their life. To cling to it is to revictimize oneself over and over. So to me, Cassie chose the “wrong” path. She was in essence, the creator of her own destiny. Had she never walked into that party, she would still be here. Having a friend who was raped did not justify her acts of revenge. I felt like the movie sent an ambiguous message about how it wanted the viewer to feel about Cassie.

I'm just nitpicking the details because discussing this movie is my therapy. Like, you've mentioned the notebook a few times. The notebook that Cassie threw in the trash when she decided to take a real chance on Ryan. I think enough time passes between then and when an investigation would be launched that the notebook has since been taken to the landfill. Without it, it's a very long shot that that part of her life is discovered. There's no other connection to be found, no other thread to pull. As I said, the plan couldn't be simpler. Few moving parts. Nothing flashy or illegal. As close to flying under the radar as one could hope for.

Even with the notebook, I think it's still a long shot. It's just first names and hash marks, first names of men against whom no crimes were committed(thus no police reports to check names).

We should probably not learn any larger lessons from the film except to protect the fragile “good men exist!” Defenders who don’t understand that the world is complex and that people can feel fear and create valid cultural commentary without demonizing an entire gender. 
I would like to personally thank you for clearing up my lifelong fear of predators! You have shown me that I should not be afraid! I simply cannot be raped! There are no rapists that will ever try to hurt me simply bc there are some good men who exist! Hooray! (See how ridiculous it is?) Thanks for solving rape culture with your daring criticisms of this film that was specifically made to highlight rape culture. Your claim that they should’ve included more good men (despite the father who is more sympathetic than the mother and the cop who ends up arresting the killer being a man) so that we know all men aren’t bad? I get this too bc I really wish that sometimes they showed some Nazis doing good things in WW2 movies that are specifically about the terrors inflicted by the Nazi party so that people didn’t just ASSUME that Nazis are all bad! 
Look, I know I’m not going to change your mind. I also know that there are a shitton of wonderful, brave and considerate men in the world, and I’m lucky to have quite a few in my life. Essentially all humans know this. 
It’s not that I can’t see where you’re coming from; most of the men in the movie are horrible characters. However, I think that you’ve jumped to a very simple conclusion without considering other views and you are now strong-arming anything that challenges your initial view. It’s okay to listen to other people. It’s ok to be wrong sometimes, I’m wrong A LOT. But I do genuinely encourage you to try to think about things from any perspectives other than your own sometimes, and to listen to what others say before you assume that an entire movie was funded and created by a major studio solely to make men (who own a majority of the studio shares) seem evil and that the movie is therefore garbage. 
(And one last thing: conflating “all the rapists in the movie happen to be male bc the protagonist is a hetero woman” to “wow they must really hate men in this movie” instead of thinking “wow they must really hate rapists in this movie” is quite telling. I think you should explore why. And I’m genuinely not accusing you of anything, I just think you should think about why you have assumed that seeing as any gender can rape. Especially as you’ve already pointed out that other genders are just as capable of raping in your previous arguments).",kkbeha

The movie doesn't make sense in that it seems 20ish people can confirm it happened including women but everyone claims that it didn't happen. The premise of the movie is so unbelievable to render the point of the story useless as a comparison to real life. Especially anything within the last 20 years but I can only refer to my experience of living in Australia. I can't even think of a story like the original incident happening in anything Ive read. It is quite detached from reality but attempts to makes points about reality. 

The director stated: ""what often happens is people say something happened, everyone knows the exact same thing happened, but they feel very differently about it and they’ve read the situation very, very differently. That’s such a sticky, fascinating thing to me. I think much more interesting than the kind of black and white that we so often see in these kinds of movies"". 

I don't know what she thinks is grey about the situation in the movie. It's very clearly black and white. There doesn't seem to be any other side other than people liked Al and don't see rape as a big deal. Which is again really detached from reality. It's like the director doesn't understand male friendships or culture at all, it very much seems like an outsider perspective making sloppy comments about the ""grey area for men"".

I like to watch rapists get their comeuppance. This disappointed me personally in all that.

But in reality, I don’t think it’s actually unrealistic, seeing as she is at bars, which are location that a lot of predators specifically seek out, and she is presenting herself in a vulnerable state, which is what predators look for. For as many nice guys as there are at the bar, they’re probably not intentionally looking for victims; the rapists are. 
So in essence, in that scene she was definitely hyperbolizing but I don’t think it works to frame the entire movie as ‘men bad women good, women whiny victims’ as you have implied. 
I also made a type in my analogy- I meant “good things Germans did”, not Nazis themselves. Also, you misread part of what I said- at no point did I claim the writer/director was male, I shared that the company itself is driven by majority male shareholders. 
I actually very much agree with your final point, that sexual violence is very narrowly presented in media. I think there should be a lot more discussion about non-fee victims and the way that we treat all sexual assault and domestic violence victims. 
However, based on the fact that you seem to turn a lot of these valid critiques into “I hate women, women suck” arguments though, I am starting to think that you really just want me to bow down and say that you’re the real victim (even though you hate victims bc apparently they’re always women).

gyoyevi,"I... I don’t understand your criticism really. There were a few parts the movie fell flat for me but I think it’s quite hugely believable what happened??? 

There are many instances where this has happened in real life? Like, so many, I don’t know how you can say it’s unrealistic at all? 

Here’s one: [British teenager ](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.stylist.co.uk/life/believe-me-the-cyprus-rape-case-itv-documentary/378972/amp) reports being gang raped in Cyprus. Despite being covered in bruises, witnesses who heard the men planning the attack and saw the state the victim was in after the attack, one witness who even saw her running from the men as they chased her, AND *video evidence* of her telling the men to get out of her hotel room, she was convicted of public mischief for lying about her gang rape and put in prison for four months. I highly recommend you watch the documentary to get a semblance of what rape survivors go through. 

Maybe you’re thinking, ok it happens in Cyprus but not America. Well, no, sadly. The Netflix documentary [Audrie & Daisy](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eMq9AL27gmo) details two separate instances of high school girls being raped and sexually assaulted, having the videos circulated through out their schools and laughed at, called sluts, ostracised for trying to press charges, one of them even had their *house burned down* forcing the family to flee the state. Because they were sexually assaulted and raped, and because people always seem to blame the (usually) female victims and side with the men. It’s easier than admitting the popular guy at school is an absolute monster. Tragically, **both of those women took their own lives due to what they endured.**

The fact this is so common & accepted is one of the main points of the entire movie. Madison *knows* Nina was raped, but thought it was her fault for getting black-out drunk all the time, oh and she was a slut anyway so. She specifically says, “don’t expect people to *take your side*”. It’s not that she doesn’t believe her, it’s just that she wasn’t gonna stop hanging around with the cool popular guys just because she got black out drunk again. I mean what did she expect, right! 

Ryan also knows she was raped but just doesn’t care. Justifies he didn’t rape Nina himself, therefore he done nothing wrong. And that Al isn’t a bad guy really, he was just a kid at the time. Not his fault! 

The dean at the college knew that she was raped. Like she says, she gets at least two accusations like this a week. It would just be too much *work* to actually hold all these young men accountable, she would have to throw out half the students! And you know, when these girls get this drunk, bad things can happen. So the girls should just stop getting drunk! What are we gonna do, ruin a young man’s life because some girl got too drunk? C’mon now.

The title of the movie itself is taken from the Brock Turner case, a convicted rapist who, despite the fact his victim was *passed out unconscious* when he raped her, despite the fact two passing men caught him in the act and had to chase him away from the young woman, he received a measly three months prison sentence for his crime, because he was a “promising young man” and they can’t jeopardise his entire career over this one little *mistake*, now can they?

She tortured herself for YEARS just for not being there, and put herself in so much danger (perhaps in part out of survivor’s guilt, and in part to prevent it from happening to anyone else by scaring the shit out of men one guy at a time).  

But like the really saccharine sweet dancing scene in the pharmacy, something just didn’t feel right about that either.  I don’t know that there would be any switch she could flip that would make her feel right about what had happened, and that’s a big problem in this world.  Even if justice were fairly delivered, it doesn’t bring people back and it doesn’t erase the trauma that the survivors carry.  It’s literally the very ***least*** that can be done, in front only of doing nothing.

gjwfljg,"> every random guy who helps her

You’re not understanding what I’m saying. It’s not random, the movie is *specifically only showing us the creeps* because that’s what the narrative focus is. 

Picture four people in a grocery store checkout line in the evening. Now imagine that someone made a movie about those people, following each of them as they went about their separate days, culminating with all of them standing together in a grocery store checkout line at the end of the movie. 

Watching that movie, would it be a crazy coincidence that all of those characters ended up in the same place at the end? Not at all. The omniscient perspective of the film is only following those characters *because* they all end up in the same place at the end, not in spite of it. Them ending up together in a grocery store is the whole reason the film is choosing to follow those people to begin with. That doesn’t mean there aren’t other people in other checkout lines whose stories aren’t being told. That doesn’t mean that any of these four people don’t interact with a bunch of other people in their days leading up to the grocery store. It’s safe to assume that both of things are true. But this hypothetical film I’m talking about is *choosing* to *only* show us the people in that one specific checkout line. That doesn’t invalidate the existence of a whole spectrum of humanity that exists outside those four characters. 

The same thing is happening here. The movie is only showing us the guys who decide to be creeps, and it is assuming that you, the audience member, have enough critical thinking skills to be able to understand the context of what the film is choosing to dramatize vs what it isn’t. Us only seeing the creeps doesn’t mean that Cassie hasn’t had other interactions with dudes who weren’t creeps, it just means that the movie isn’t *about* those people and there’s no need to show them. 

You seem to be having trouble with this, and are instead assuming that only what is explicitly depicted on screen represents an objective statement about *all men* in the world of the movie. You’re watching a movie about rapists and saying “why are they only showing us rapists?!”",kkbeha

gyqvxyn,"Okay because I've never heard of these stories before I looked into them. 

The 2019 Cyprus court released a 70 page document detailing the evidence of the case. I haven't read it but it seems to have silenced a lot of the media about the case. The alleged victim has claimed several different stories of how the rape began, initially she said she consented to sex with one person then 12 entered the room and held her down. However, there is video evidence of her having consensual sex with 4 of the accused. Others accused have evidence of not being present i.e. evidence of them being somewhere else. 

There's a reason you can't just believe what someone says. She might have been raped after consensual sex with the 4 but because the story keeps changing it becomes harder to believe. So I don't think this case relates that well to this movie. 

Audrie and Daisy stories are hard to find information on. The bullying and harrassment seem to be a wealth and influence difference, where the rich can and do bully victims. It doesn't seem to be a high school social hierarchy thing like in the movie. 

Rape crimes are hard to prove, they require a lot of time and energy for all involved. Rape cases are often carried out in ways that don't benefit the victim. However, on the other hand we do see men going to prison for false claims and only being released because the alleged victim bragged about it. People don't believe either party because you don't know who is telling the truth unless there is evidence. It's not as simple as ""believe women, women never lie"". As with anyone claiming anything, you treat people as if they are telling the truth whilst confirming the story and gaining evidence. 

My experience is different to yours most likely. I've been the victim of a false accusation and been present to a time a friend had been falsely accused. Thankfully it didn't hurt my reputation because she had claimed the same thing about several other guys. And for my friend, she invited him back to hers, we were sitting on the couch and they started getting frisky, so we left for 30 mins. A week later she claimed he raped her but she had taken medication beforehand that messed with her memory and none of us knew until after. She was conscious, just to make that abundantly clear.",kkbeha

A) We have no actual confirmation that the 'scalpel' she threatened him with was an actual scalpel and, if it was, she's in the midst of a BUNCH of doctors, so it's not an inescapable conclusion that medical kit could not have been there already. (I'm aware of the multiple-negatives - they're deliberate.)
B) If she used GHB, they'd have to test the party within 12 hours, and even then it's an unreliable test AND not unheard of for it to have been used in a party context voluntarily (both points which courts use to free rapists regularly). So even IF they managed to test everyone and found GHB remaining in one of their systems, it does not prove involuntary administration.

I know you know nothing about the cases. This is why I recommended you watch the documentaries of both cases. I’m sure you won’t because you’re invested in the idea rape culture isn’t all that bad and no interest in anything disproving that.

Please read this article on the Cyprus case: https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/f/cyprus-trial-porn-culture

In addition to the things mentioned in the article (and some points I have stated in my original comment which you have conveniently chosen to ignore), there were:

Witnesses who reported hearing some of the men accused in a bar discussing how they were going to get the woman in their hotel room and rape before the attack occurred 

A witness who saw the woman fleeing down the hotel steps as the men chased her, who reported she was extremely distressed and appeared injured 

In the victim’s statement, she said she was raped by “about 12” men, after being pressured to give a more exact number. She didn’t state it was definitely 12 men as you don’t tend to take inventory whilst being gang raped.

The police then went out and arrested 12 men. The victim *did not* say, yes it was each of those 12 specific men who raped me. But when some of the men arrested were shown to have not been involved in the rape, the police used this to claim the woman was lying about the entire ordeal.

On top of this, there was **DNA evidence** found on and inside the victim and in the hotel room, of men who were *never* arrested or investigated. 

Furthermore, [former DCI David Gee](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/woman-accused-of-making-up-cyprus-gang-to-give-interview) said that if this event had occurred within the U.K., there appears to be sufficient evidence to bring several men to court and charge at least one of them with rape. 

Also there is not video evidence of the woman having consensual sex with four men. Please do some proper research before stating such utter inaccuracies.

The video shows the woman having consensual sex with **one man** whom she had formed a relationship with. The video shows the other men barging into the room and the victim tells them to get out. 

There are also other accounts from women having stayed in that same hotel and being harassed, stalked and threatened off of men, who reported their experiences to the hotel staff and police only to be dismissed as lying. 

Please watch the documentary Believe Me - The Cyprus Rape Case if you are interested in actually hearing from the victim herself. 

Ok. Now on to Audrie and Daisy. Your take on this case is so wholly inaccurate it actually hurts to read.

It **absolutely was a “social hierarchy thing”, EXACTLY LIKE in the movie**. For Daisy Coleman, her rapist was in the high school football team, which is the pride of the entire town. People were outraged that she dared to make an accusation against a footballer.

Her family found her unconscious and half naked in the front garden, in the January weather. 

Her hair was frozen to the ground. 

Her skin was blue. Her younger brother said he thought she was dead, because no human being’s skin is supposed to look like that.  

Her handbag, phone and underwear were found thrown into the neighbours garden.

She had extremely high amounts of alcohol in her system. 

She was 14 years old. High school seniors lured her to a party, where they got her comatose and one raped her. They then dumped her outside her own like a piece of garbage.

Her 13 year old friend also claimed she was raped/sexually assaulted by another man at this party. 

People at her school and in the community printed **t-shirts** with “team [rapists name]” on the front.

The police chief makes multiple comments in the Audrie & Daisy doc, that these 17 year olds were  *just young boys* who *couldn’t be blamed* for not being able to resist having sex with some drunk girls at a party. 

In fact, the *the 13 & 14 year old girls are to blame* for getting in that state in the first place. Oh and why did they even go to the party, if they didn’t want to have sex? 

Daisy attempted suicide multiple times following the ordeal (and has tragically since succeeded).

She carved her rapists name into her skin.

She went to rape survivor support groups to connect with others who have been through what she has. 

What was this, all part of her elaborate ruse?

If you want the “hard to find” information on this case, *watch the documentary*. See for yourself what those girls went through, how the police chief speaks about Daisy. 

You’ve also conveniently ignored the Brock Turner case because it doesn’t fit with your narrative. Go figure.

Again, this movie was made *precisely because it is so close to reality*. Because it is the *universal experience of so, so, so many women*.

When I talk about these other cases of people getting even, that's not even meant to be a greenlight for them to go ahead either, but I can at least emotionally grasp that and understand it. So I understand Beatrix choosing to do what she did but it's still wrong. Her daughter being there implies she'll have her own vendetta against Beatrix and the cycle of violence continues. PYW alludes to it as well with her father's concern for Cassie and subsequent relief that she seems to finally be healing but at other points the movie seems to glorify and endorse her actions as though it is the right thing to do when it most certainly is not. Not any of the mentioned people have a real moral argument to stand on but Inigo Montoya is a clownish character so it's hard to take him seriously, Wick's dog is a joke of a premise but no one bats an eye because we don't watch John Wick for thought out moral arguments. Fleck and Bickle are lunatics and it's clear they are not to be idolized.

""**you’re actually not bright enough to realize that the case WAS legal self defense.**"" <-- More fortune telling from you. You don't decide what is and isn't self-defense.

gsmaico,"If being threatened with being held accountable for his actions made him regress that quickly that fast, to the point where he obstructed justice, then he hadn’t actually matured that much. That was just a facade.

I don’t understand how you’re so quick to justify his actions but villainize the character for not wanting to be with a rape apologist? Almost seems like you’re missing the entire point of the movie and maybe it just wasn’t meant for you.",kkbeha

gh4j7xq,"Oh really? So you saw evidence that I “got over” the “disability” of sexism by pointing out that “‘Feminist’ isn’t a gender”? So you agree that statement *isn’t* sexist? Then what was your previous evidence for this disability? It’s bad enough you’re an asshole, you’re incompetent to boot. And unlike my actual disability, yours appears to be chronic and incurable.

It’s the kind of incompetence that has you employ your alt account to dogpile on a comment when all it takes to unmask you is seeing that said account has only posted 3 comments: one ITT using your same obnoxious syntax (“Ehh”), one in a giveaway thread that you also posted in with your main account (double dipping, are we?), and one in a thread about “Happiest Season” in *this* fucking sub.

gj9kni0,The entire point is that it isn't up for me to decide. You go on and on about the legal system but use your fortune telling as a basis for your argument. I could say yes and he could still be convicted. I could say no and he could avoid being charged. This entire argument started because you said the guy would file a police report and be done which is unequivocally total bullshit. On top of that you said the guy would face zero social repercussions which is also unequivocally total bullshit.,kkbeha

Dramatic, much? 

> They will do everything they can to avoid accountability, which is why it's important that we instead allow for some reasonable atonement because otherwise we push men to fight life or death to uphold rape culture.

I’m sorry... what? You’re saying that the only way to stop men from raping and protecting rapists is... lightening the punishment? Men have been getting off easy for centuries. The whole point of this movie is to point out how ridiculously hard it is to try a man for rape and that most rapists get off and are able to successfully move on with the accusation only a blip while it can ruin a woman’s life.

You’re using your Twitter “cancel” examples (that mind you, fall off the radar after a year or two and sometimes even months) and ignoring statistics upon statistics of rape cases that go ignored or without justice. 

What will end rape culture is actually persecuting rapists and stop letting rape cases slide. Your argument is the same argument plenty of judges have when they let rapists off “he was just a kid (even though he was above 18)” “this will ruin his life”, so it’s delusional to think having them get off lightly so that they come forward when this is already happening and perpetuating the mentality that rapists and rape apologists can get away with it. 

I think I have to dip out here because this is a whole other level of denial that I am not equipped to argue with. Yikes.

ETA: Taking a quick look at some of your super woke comments yet seeing that this concept is going over your head... it’s starting to make sense why the point of this movie isn’t really “clicking” for you.",kkbeha

gsmwdbl,"Rape is a very large spectrum, and that's not even getting into sexual assault and harassment which aren't even rape.  Then you have Ryan's crime which wasn't even a crime.  So yeah, until we have a nuanced system of prosecuting abusers with consequences that are proportional to their actions, we're creating a culture where many men will not stand up or speak out against abuse which means more rape and more people getting away with it.

It's telling you used the word ""persecuting"" instead of prosecuting because we certainly are persecuting them.",kkbeha

Your ego is what makes you unable to let things go and prove you're ""right"" even though the evidence proves otherwise. You present your evidence for self-defense not to the police but to a courtroom. You don't kill people and then tell the police hey, sorry I killed her but I had to and they let you go. Not only did you agree with that fact over and over, but you provided a link to a website that said as much. For some reason though in your brain you think you get to fill out a police report and walk away after you kill someone. That isn't how it works and all the lawyers' pages I linked, and that you linked said otherwise. The legal system triggers me? I've been quoting lawyers and linking laws this entire time, lol.

Where did I say you get tried? You're an idiot if you think all that is involved is you fill out a police report. Lots of people have shot intruders and been charged with murder. Why don't you stop talking about irrelevant shit like masturbation and admit your fragile ego can't handle being wrong.
