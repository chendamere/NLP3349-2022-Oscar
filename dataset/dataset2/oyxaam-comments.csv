h7wk3gj,The fact that everyone in this thread keeps saying that a different character stole the show really speaks to how well all the characters were developed and acted. I can't think of any one in this film who didn't kill it.,oyxaam
h7vzcoh,"I can definitely see how Bloodsport was originally written as Deadshot, but I still loved Idris Elba in the role and he definitely brought some new stuff to the movie that Deadshot probably wouldn't have, so I'm glad he was there. 

My favorite in the movie though was Ratcatcher 2",oyxaam

h7vyjy9,"Starting the movie with the B-team was such a creative move. The reveal of when they all get massacred and we realise that was Waller's plan all along, as Elba's A-team arrives on the beach, was just immensely satisfying to watch.  


Then the movie just kept getting better from there.",oyxaam
h7x2xfk,"I can't believe how bummed I am that Rick Flagg died. I was enjoying him so much that I was really hoping he would pop back up in a sequel or in the Peacemaker spinoff. Huge departure from the bland, forgettable character he was in the first movie.",oyxaam
h7w66wm,There’s something hilarious about watching a character die off before the opening credits and still seeing his name in those opening credits like they’re going to be central to the plot of the movie,oyxaam

h7w35a1,"Harley Quinn’s arms whipping around in a circle and then straightening out to shot, during her escape, was a gorgeous shot imo.",oyxaam
h7vxbz4,"Blew my expectations out of the water.  Elba committed to the role 150%, and the movie just embraced the goofiness of the premise and took itself exactly as serious as it needed to be when it mattered.

Also Polka Dot man ruled.  Cena gets an honorable mention, I didn't enjoy him in the beginning but by the end I was sold.",oyxaam

h7w5gj5,I wonder how much that mom bit cost the VFX department.,oyxaam

h7vxhqc,"RIP Captain Boomerang. The best part of the first film, and a good Jai Courtney role. Glad we got that one sick kill before he died though.",oyxaam
h7w6zr4,"Amazing movie. I was surprised at how much I liked Rick Flag, he was really likeable, and his death hit the hardest. Especially considering how forgettable he was in the first movie.

Also, the Milton joke was hilarious. I love how he just tags along with them and no one acknowledges him.",oyxaam

h7vwuuq,I need a figure of Sebastian,oyxaam
h7vyq8o,Congrats to James Gunn for making a movie with just as much heart as GOTG but somehow even weirder.,oyxaam
h7vx8cd,"That bit where they find out they just slaughtered the rebel camp had my theatre howling.

That was a great time. Just hand the keys to the Suicide Squad franchise over to James Gunn.",oyxaam
h7vwytv,This movie was infinitely better than the previous one.  Cena was fantastic.,oyxaam
h7vxc0v,Best 'your mum' joke in all of cinema.,oyxaam
h7vxjhg,"The entire sequence of Harley Quinn breaking out was incredibly fun and well done. It might be my favorite sequence in a superhero film in recent memory.

Also the main squad killing the entire resistance squad to rescue Rick Flag because they thought he was being tortured and then it being revealed that the soldiers they killed were the good guys who were fighting against an oppressive government and they actually saved Flags life was some stellar dark comedy. James Gunn was the perfect director for this kind of film and that moment sums up his comedy pretty well.",oyxaam
h7w4i5a,Idris Elba held it down,oyxaam
h7w2zo0,"I really love what this movie did with Starro. He's one of those ridiculous villains from the comics you'd expect would never actually make it to the big screen, but Gunn made it work. The character had such a great campy/psychedelic design, as you would expect, and the starfish zombies were genuinely freaky. If he hadn't just murdered a whole bunch of people, his final line almost made me feel bad for him. There was so much cosmic wonder in that line.

And Polka-Dot man, too!  Not sure if that's a recent modern origin to the character, but that was a great reinvention of the character. I would not complain if someone made a movie about the Batman adventure which landed Polka Dot Man in prison. David Mastmalchian finds such a great balance between twitchy creep and genuine sadness. 

Really, the cast was perfect all around. Margot Robbie was the best she's ever been. I can see why they greenlit a John Cena spin-off so fast, and Idris Elba and Daniella Melchior really tied the movie together. Wish we'd got a bit more Peter Capaldi, but otherwise I have no complaints.",oyxaam
h7w2vzk,Every movie I see Margot Robbie play Harley Quinn the more I realize that she is the perfect casting for her,oyxaam
h7vy50p,"Also, the PIXIES!!! And Jim Carolll!! Man, Gunn sure knows how to pick em.",oyxaam
h7w4s8o,"From the time I saw the initial cast I thought ""Hey this is an impressive cast! It has some of my favorites like Michael Rooker and Nathan Fillion.""

And then I was reminded in the first five minutes that this is a James Gunn movie.",oyxaam
h7vzi9t,"Ok, that first like 45 minutes had me rolling in the aisles. Killing off Rick Flagg stunned me tho",oyxaam
h7vwsgt,I’ve just met Sebastian but if anything happens to him I’ll kill everyone in here and then myself.,oyxaam
h7vwxvi,Loved every single second of it. Really needed a good movie like that right now. Gunn knocked it out of the park!,oyxaam
h7wa4l8,Harley hugging Flag after escaping the palace and seeing the rest of the squad going through all the trouble to rescue her was a very sweet moment. <3,oyxaam
h7vycu5,"I love how the title cards were diagetic (currently the only word I can think of to describe them) within the scenes. Some great stylization that makes it seem natural in the settings and environments. I also had flashback of Deadpool's X-Force during the beach scene, which was a great way to introduce the main Suicide Squad.",oyxaam
h7vxoaw,"So theres a couple different things I just wanted to say.

- I’m glad James Gunn finally managed to show people that Harley Quinn isn’t useless. Her taking out that entire building on her own effortlessly was definitely a high point.

- I realized while watching I really wanted the entire core team to survive and was on edge at the thought of them dying, something the first iteration didn’t do in any sort of way.

- Did anyone else feel bad for Starro? I know they only talked about 3 separate times but it still gave me so much sympathy for them.

-Polka Dot Man and the situation with his mom was the funniest thing I’ve ever seen in a superhero movie.",oyxaam
h7w52ol,"King Shark's ""FUCK!"" is the hardest I've laughed at any movie in a very long time. Such a simple joke, but perfect. Here's to hoping we get more like this in the future.",oyxaam
h7w1u76,"Tickled me how Gunn made the Thinker such a pervert, his reaction to Ratcatcher threatening to send a dozen rodents up his ass and Starro detailing what he has done in his experiments, it was clear Capaldi relished returning to a more ‘adult’ role after his stint as the Doctor.",oyxaam
h7w5llo,Sean Gunn was Calendar Man!,oyxaam
h7vydpw,Some great political commentary on US interventionism and callousness. Particularly the scene where they massacre the camp only to find out that they weren’t enemies. And Cena’s character’s “I’ll kill as many people as I have to to attain peace” (paraphrase),oyxaam
h7w1juf,"“I was happy floating just staring at the stars” (or something similar) 


That line hit hard..   Yes, city wide destruction needed to be averted and all… but you gotta feel for the giant parasitic starfish there.  If it weren’t for passing to close to Earth it’d be the content intelligent stellar Echinoderm it was supposed to be…. 

And in the end, it was only doing what was in its nature.  So tell me, who’s the real world ending parasite here..


^^Turns ^^out ^^it’s ^^man….

In all seriousness, really enjoyed that….  Glad I saw it in theaters, gonna rewatch it at home tomorrow.",oyxaam
h7vz4bt,Anyone else feel bad for the starfish? I think it deserved a portion of island to live in.,oyxaam
h7vwvjd,Margot Robbie is so good as Harley Quinn.,oyxaam
h7wp62r,"Luna: ""Corto Maltesians...""
Harley: ""Of course!""",oyxaam
h7ws98u,"Rick Flagg was legit a real hero in the squad. I went from liking Peacemaker to hating him. Peacemaker. What a joke. 

I hope the show is good because I’ll need to get over it. 

Also. Tinkerer was so good. He was legit an evil Doctor who for a huge chunk of it and I loved it.",oyxaam
h7y1azm,Sylvester Stallone really outacted this one.,oyxaam
h7w2lee,The scene with Harley in the water was shot so well and looked gorgeous… then I took a step back and realized she was inside a giant alien’s eyeball surrounded by rats eating it from the inside lol. Feel like that whole scene perfectly captures what this movie is and I love it,oyxaam
h7w4xp5,Did harley quinn make a guy slice his own throat with a piece of cloth?,oyxaam
h7vy2ow,"One of the best things about the plot was how dense and twisty it was. Every fifteen minutes it seemed like there was a ""oh you thought this is where this was going? Well here comes something else entirely!""

Most movies have two or three sequences that stand out. This movie was just one funny sequence after another. It never let up. It just kept adding more and more on top of it,  not only in terms of plot but structure too. I loved the quick 8 minute flashback to show us how Bloodsport would have his faceoff with Peacemaker.

And then there's the little touches, like the great soundtrack. The little title cards for each major section of the movie, and the hilarious fake out opening.

This might be James Gunn's most confident and fully realized movie ever. I don't think it had the lightning in a bottle charm of GOTG1 but it had not of the sagging in the middle of (the great) GOTG2.

It was heartfelt yet irreverent. It was gruesome and yet humorous. It was beautiful to look at and yet overloaded with unexpected body horror...and yeah that part was the hardest to watch, lol.

Really well done. Maybe the best made DCEU film yet. In fact, I think it was.",oyxaam
h7wildc,"“I was happy, floating, staring at the stars”😭

h7w5q6x,Throw Margot as Harley in the category of flawless casting choices,oyxaam
h7w6ivz,"Great movie. Heavily influenced by Ostrander's original run, yet entirely James Gunn's film. 

- Waller isn't just a cold hearted, unfeeling antagonist this time. She actually shows some trepidation at making the hard decisions only she could make. Not like the first film where she guns down her entire staff (just complete lazy writing).

- Belle Reve's staff actually has some personality. This is 100% Ostrander's influence rubbing off on Gunn. It's a movie with a big cast, so obviously they don't get a lot of time on screen. But when they did, the staff (Flo, John Economos, etc.) were very likable. 

- the comics were good at introducing lame villains then injecting them with pathos to make you care about them. This film did that with polka dot man, Bloodsport, ratcatcher 2, Peacemaker, Rick Flag, and king shark. Specifically, I think Elba's Bloodsport can easily carry on as new leader of the squad, let alone his own film. Loved the stuff with his daughter. 

- ratcatcher 2 is going to be a huge surprise for people. Charmingly played by the actress. And I love that it's the second ratcatcher, which makes the DCEU feel lived in. 

- Starro was not a wasted villain, and I love that Gunn gets to be the one to introduce it to audiences. 

- the original Squad comics were blatantly political, and so is this film. Both the film and original run criticized  American foreign politics, and Gunn handled it really well. Interested to see the new Peacemaker TV show too. If this film becomes a hit, I'm prepared to see Fox News complain that comics and Hollywood have become too political / have a ""leftist agenda"" or some hilarious BS.

Overall, great film well worth your time. So sad to see Boomerang bite the dust :(",oyxaam

h7w040x,"I had a dumb smile on my face through most of the movie. What I love about The Suicide Squad is how joyful it feels, more so than most other modern superhero films (both DC and Marvel). 

The 5 minutes or so where the squad are just having a good time at the bar is great. And it’s not just there for the sake of it either; it makes Peacemaker’s betrayal of his fellow squad members hit that much harder. 

Also, I was just thinking the other day how ‘Hey’ by Pixies isn’t in enough films/tv, and it was used absolutely brilliantly here. Music across the board was fantastic.",oyxaam

h7wtzyx,[deleted],oyxaam
h7vz01v,"Daniela Melchior was fantastic, it’s been said so many times in reviews but Ratcatcher II really was the heart of the film, and Melchior was great especially considering this is her first major role.

I hope this leads to a long and successful career for her, reminds me of Ana de Armas’ career surge following Blade Runner 2049, and thinking of it Melchior would be a great addition to one of the Knives Out sequels.",oyxaam
h7w14cc,"This movie was pretty fucking great. 

I was shocked at some of the deaths too. Especially Captain Boomerang. Even though he's not a major DC villain, he's still a somewhat iconic Flash villain.",oyxaam

Polka-Dot was OP, did not expect to love that character as much as I did. Wish he didn’t go out like that.

Nanaue making a Peacemaker figurine with the C4 or whatever was freaking hilarious, loved that part.

Elba and Cena were fantastic. Played off each other really well.

h7w9mf5,Ratcatcher 2/Daniela Melchior stole my heart.,oyxaam
h7vwuo1,"Man, James Gunn just gets it. His comedy feels so effortless yet he's over here balancing it with violence, emotional core, great characters, and zany ridiculousness. He just makes great movies and this is definitely one of them. 

The casting is stellar. Gunn knows exactly what's interesting about the weirdest possible characters and how to highlight it flawlessly. Elba, Robbie, and Cena are given so many chances to shine and they absolutely do. Cena may have been the standout to me. He had some of the best lines and absolutely delivered on that character. Viola Davis is the cold and frightening version of Waller that was only hinted at in the other movie. Even a lot of unexpected characters given some real flesh like Ratcatcher and Polka-Dot Man or even just Waller's in-office team. 

There are so many great action sequences and moments for the powers to shine. The scene where Bloodsport and Peacemaker cleared out the rebel camp was exceptional. Just two guys with dark jobs doing them nonchalantly and with incredible accuracy. Harley giving that all too true monologue after killing El Presidente and then breaking out of the house. There's even some weird body horror stuff like Polka-Dot man's disease or his motherly hallucinations. Honestly, this feels like the full package when I think about what this movie should be. 

At the end of the day, this is just a ton of fun. Doesn't matter where it fits in in the timeline or what these characters do before or after the movie. It just exists to be a blast and it absolutely delivers. To me, this solidifies Gunn as one of, if not the, best pop filmmaker right now. I hope he takes a well deserved rest after GoTG3 but I just can't wait to see what he does next. 9/10.

And the characters! King Shark, Polka dot man and Ratcatcher 2 stole the show. The scene with Taika was a tear jerker, and there were many others.

It takes full advantage of the premise of the Suicide Squad. You have interesting characters who are actual villains. There's good chemistry and interaction between the characters. They go on a mission that makes sense. The characters have abilities/powers that serve useful roles for their mission. There's a lot of dark humor but it can get serious when it needs to. It has political commentary without being pretentious or too preachy like some of the other DCEU films.

I am now very interested in the Peacemaker show and I'm excited to see what James Gunn does next for DC. I'd definitely want to see another Suicide Squad from him but I'd like him see do more shows and movies for DC. I would love it if he worked together with the people making Doom Patrol and Harley Quinn on more HBO Max stuff.",oyxaam

This time I was curious if the same shock-jokes land because I found they didn't when I rewatched Deadpool.

“Nobody likes a show off.”

“They do if what you’re showing off is *dope as fffuucckk*”

was the line of the movie for me, but there was a lot to like here. It will be very interesting to see if Gunn wants to do more of this or if he’s burnt out on superhero stuff.

He legitimately bonds with the team at the bar. He respects Flag. He calls Nanaue a ""play baby"" and then seems to appreciate the little plastique figurine (in his own asshole-y way).

But my favorite part is when he talks about how he loves peace so much he will kill as many people he needs to to achieve it. ***Because it's true.*** 

Waller no doubt convinced him that leaking Project Starfish would have caused an international incident at *best* if not an outright war. Leaking the information wouldn't bring those people who were experimented on back. He didn't look like he *approved* of the experimentation.

- How Ratcatcher 2 always acted like she'd rather be asleep
- Polka Dot Man's hallucinations
- How they blended the time descriptors (""NOW"", ""Eight minutes earlier"") into their surroundings
- The creative visuals like filming the fight scene from the POV of Peacekeeper's helmet and all the gorgeous exploding flowers when Harley blasted her captors
- the pay off for keeping the javelin
- How Bloodsport was such a dick to his daughter.  It felt different than how incarcerated fathers are ususally portrayed.
- The surprise of killing off Boomer so damn early in the film
- Joel Kinnaman showing us the Rick Flag we deserved but didn't get in the first film.  Shows how it isn't just the actor, it is the script and the director who help make characters memorable.  The only other time I feel like we've seen such a remarkable do over is Ryan Reynolds and Deadpool.
- Nathan Fillion being Nathan Fillion and Harley's reaction to TDK's powers
- Waller's staff staging a mutiny.  If only all government employees had the backbone to push back against unethical and inhumane orders!
- I could watch an entire film of King Shark eating people",oyxaam

They were floating through space just looking at the stars until humans took them. They tied them up. Tortured them. Experimented on them. Used them. Raped them. 

It’s like killer whales. We don’t really blink when a killer whale goes nuts on sea world and kills its guard because we understand that a sentient and intelligent creature can’t be held captive and hurt without expecting it to lash out and fight. 

Starro went nuts and attacked once he was free. 30

Brilliant reverse trope scene when King Shark getting bit by the jellys and the water was turning red.

Anyone notice when Harley gets in the taxi with javelin, that it sticks out..making her look like a a knight on a horse. However arriving to Luna's complex, she looked like and described herself as a princess. Thus, she served the roles of both the princess in distress and the knight saving the princess.

At the beginning, Boomerang wipes poo from his shoes..it hit me that that poo was likely from weasel, making it sonmuch more gross.

OG Suicide Squad was on average a bad movie, but it was a bad movie because the bad parts were really bad and it just had fewer parts that were really good. This film took all the really good parts (the concept, Harley Quinn, Waller, and a few other pieces), removed all the bad parts (there were many), and made huge improvements where they could (overall R rating, dialogue, humor). There are *a lot* of IPs out there in the world that had decent parts with glaring issues (The Phoenix Sage did it twice lol). If this movie is successful, I would love to see a shift away from hardcore reboots and remakes and towards soft re-attempts at other films. Unless I missed something, there really isn't any reason that The Suicide Squad couldn't exist in the same film as Suicide Squad, it just never really acknowledged it. The Horror genre is actually a little bit ahead in this regard with films like Halloween and Candyman ignoring certain aspects of the timeline.",oyxaam

I hope we see him in another movie.",oyxaam
h84n9wy,"I gave this movie a second watch because I wasn't that crazy about it the first time around, maybe I just wasn't in the right mood or something, but I realize now it's a damn good movie. This movie makes sense in every way as a proper Suicide Squad movie. 

This story is actually interesting and fun unlike the first movie. The characters all actually make sense for this. It's hard to choose favorite characters because all of them are awesome, but I might go with Ratcatcher 2, Harley, Peacemaker, and Bloodsport. Ratcatcher 2 is just fucking awesome in this 

The violence and gore, pretty damn satisfying. It's always so refreshing to experience R rated violence in a kickass movie. 

And this movie is pretty funny as well. I think one of my favorite moments was when the Squad naively murdered the Freedom Fighters, I didn't see that twist coming, that is perfect dark humor! 

I know this has been said to death, no pun intended, but this a Suicide Squad movie done right and I hope the DCEU will get more like this

Michael Rooker doing everything short of calling for his mother was hilarious.

I'm surprised we didn't see anyone from the squad get starro-ed but by that point in the movie there weren't many left to kill.

Nanaue is my boi and he should have had his chance to party with the boys.

Sad to see Boomer go, R.I.P to one of Jai Courtney's only fun roles.

After so many years of The Doctor it was a great surprise to be reminded how well Peter Capaldi can play total pieces of shit.

Flagg was an actual character instead of the army man action figure he was in the first.

Flula Borg showing off about putting on muscle mass on the press circuit is hilarious.

A future suicide squad without him will feel a bit empty... And having a peace maker show after what he did just feels like twisting the knife.

Same goes with Polka dot man. I am all in with the deaths in the movie and I'm fine with the intro sequence (Boomerang's death was shocking) but there was no need to kill him just for a joke. 

On the other hand, I'm happy for Flula Borg'a character. He may have died early on, but he's single handedly the main reason why Harley was able to burst open Starro's eye and let the rats in. His spirit was around the whole movie with the javalin in Harley's possession.",oyxaam

h7z9jew,"James Gunn doing a masterclass on how to make the viewer invested in such a variety of oddjob characters by giving them good personalities. King Shark is miles more endearing than anyone in the other suicide squad film. I have to say I've been getting tired of the ultragore in superhero stuff lately, it just doesn't fit the aesthetic imo, and even though there were times it went a bit too far here I think this was a good example of how to pull it off with the use of comedy. 

Hopefully future directors and writers will understand what makes this film so good and follow suit for other DCEU films, I worry they'll just take on board the ultra gore or dumb jokes and be incapable of replicating the personality that allows those dumb jokes and ultra gore to work.",oyxaam

Its wild, I went in expecting King Shark to be my favorite, and he was great, but Ratcatcher 2 or Polka Dot Man were probably my favorite characters overall. Ratcatcher 2 was the absolute heart and soul of this film. Idris Elba absolutely killed it as Bloodsport. John Cena knocked it out of the park as Peacemaker. They're comedic timing and chemistry was just on point. I was really glad Harley wasn't the focus of the movie either, and she really shined in her parts as well.

I can't express how upset I was when Boomerang died, though. He was by far my favorite part of the first movie. James Gunn really set the stakes with that death, and it also felt like a sort of slate-wiping moment to get rid of most of the connections to the first film.

I'd like to add that the cinematrogaphy is such an improvement. The group shot in the rain looks badass,  and adored the scenery when they do traversal of the cliffs, jungles and city.

That Harley Quinn escape segment was gorgeous with the camera work, color grading, and the effects used. 

Same goes with the King Shark scene with the aquarium. Just had an actual emotional and beautiful element to it that made you actually care for a murderous land shark haha.

h7wxj5a,"I really liked this movie, it was a fucking great ride and a breath of fresh air. Gunn needs to stay with DC after Guardians 3. This movie was better than both Guardians movies combined.

  
King Shark, Polka Dot Man, and Peacemaker were my favorite characters.

  
I was genuinely upset that they killed Captain Boomerang. He was my favorite character in the first next to Harley. Jai Courtney finally found something that worked for him and Gunn just was the embodiment of ""I'm about to end this man's whole career"" lol really hope he can come back after the Flashpoint shit because I want to see him interact with The Rogues against Ezra Miller's Flash....RIP Digger.

  
I also hate how Polka Dot Man died. I felt he really could have just melted a hole through Starro's eye and killed him but Gunn wanted to give us one last gut punch, him turning around to be a Superhero could have been done nicely if he had lived and maybe got his own spin-off show since Gunn wants to do more than just Peacemaker.

  
Speaking of Peacemaker, goddamn, John Cena killed it. I mean, wow. Whenever he was on screen he just ate it up, dude definitely has a certified Hero/Villain future for the rest of his acting career. Cannot wait for his show in January.

  
Please let James Gunn be in charge of everything Harley Quinn related in the DCEU, this was THE best performance Margot Robbie has given in her five year time-span as the character and this movie showed just how resourceful and badass she can be and not just ""lol crazy sexy eye candy"".

  
I didn't think Starro could work in live action, but he was horrifying. Gunn absolutely did him justice, he was fucking great, and I don't know how he pulled it off, but he made the Suicide Squad going up against a giant alien starfish that produces other smaller starfish to turn people into drones more believable than them going up against a supernatural witch.

  
I would love to see Sean Gunn reprise his role as Calendar Man, the cameo was hilarious and awesome, and honestly I think he could pull off the psychopath killer if they ever wanted to put him in a Batman movie or really any other DCEU related project.

  
Flagg/Peacemaker fight in the reflection of that toilet bowl helmet was beautiful.

  
To top it all off, they made me actually care about Flagg, which I thought wasn't possible, I mean, I sort of liked him in the first one, but in the end he was just the run of the mill exposition machine/stereotypical soldier guy, no personality or any redeeming qualities to make me want to see more of him, this time around he had all that and more.....and he dies....which sucked because I thought he would be the only guy to keep returning to the franchise to make sure the team stays in line under Waller's command.

  
I could go on and on but I've probably just said more than I needed and just said things other people said, so I'll leave it at that. Just a fantastically fun movie that knew what it was, this was the movie we deserved 5 years ago. Hand the damn franchise over to him and get him out of Marvel.

If he ended up redeemed at the end it would have been super cool, but instead all of his development was thrown away for a joke (and a pretty predictable moment at that too). And I get that the point is that it's supposed to be shocking and cruel, but yeah... I got attached XD  
2) I really, REALLY wish Waller got killed. This bitch has got no soul in this movie.  


Oh and also  Boomerang dying 5 minutes in was a VERY bold move. Made me sad but I respect Gunn for doing that lol",oyxaam

h7w6u4h,"I REALLY hope this is the style DC movies will lean into. Marvel has their large interconnected cinematic universe, where most of the movies have comedy moments but are serious and real. They're relatable and human, they're grounded in reality with the occasional reminder there's superpower too. They have a formula they stick to that make it so they're rarely bad, but more predictable. 

This movie was none of that. It was outlandish, super extra, gruesome, didn't take itself seriously, goofy, and entertaining as all heal. I mean they have just a giant, weasel as a character that ate almost 30 children recruited on a mission and some people were asking questions but they still didn't think it was out of place and I loved that. They don't have to worry about keeping it PG-13 so they can be really gruesome with the fights, the gore, the language, and shows like invincible & The Boys shows there is a desire for that in Superhero movies on the big screen. 

And where there is similarity between DC and Marvel is with making the characters somewhat relatable without making the entire movie about their backstory. Like with Ratcatcher and her story with her dad or Polka Dot man and having a mom that treats him like her property. These were short parts of the experience that were reinforced with little moments throughout the movie and I still felt just as attached to Ratcatcher as I did Dr. Strange.

Marvel has their thing and they have it on lock, DC can *not* do what Marvel has done since it's taken them over a decade of setup, DC needs to go their own direction with their comic movies and Suicide Squad does a lot right to set it apart from Marvel movies and is still really entertaining.",oyxaam

h80nc1p,"TSS King Shark was the cute one while the CW Flash one is terrifying and much better CGI. Lol.

I hope Batman saved a piece of Starro so he can finally grow the best Robin. (If that was the after credits scene, I’d have gone bonkers.)

In all honesty, this is what the first movie should’ve been like: a heist/infiltration/extraction/comedy. They had so much potential having such quirky characters and wasted them all in a blue laser in the sky movie. 

James Gunn made every character special and humanized them while Ayer just gave em your run of the mill treatment.  

9/10. Will watch over and over. Especially the camp infiltration scene.",oyxaam

Fun movie overall but really glad King Shark lived through the whole movie after like five close calls of death.",oyxaam
h87ibbx,"One sad part I noticed towards the end was when the smaller Starro was speaking through the General with his ""I was happy"" line, the small one starts looking up at the sky as well as the main Starro when he started collapsing down onto the buildings.

Crazy to think they managed to make Starro sympathetic, but the poor guy was tortured, experimented on and (going by one of the lines) potentially physically/mentally abused by the Thinker for 30 long years, finally breaks free and takes his revenge out on the city only to be defeated by our loveable band of misfits, the last thing he looks at before dying was the sky, likely hoping to see those beautiful stars one more time.",oyxaam

h88ehk2,This is the second superhero movie where a rat is the key to save the world.,oyxaam
h89biaf,"The movie made me care about all of Team 2 (and Rick Flag), so I was happy to see most of them make it out.

As a wrestling fan I'm rooting for Cena to succeed in Hollywood since he comes off as such a good (but very weird) dude. So I obviously root for his characters. Peacemaker killed it especially the ""I have the shot seen"" when he is just aiming at a maid/secretary, and the showing off scene with Bloodsport. Didn't know he survived (didn't see the second post credit scene), but I kinda figured he would be revived or something for the TV show.

King Shark was fun, and they faked out his death like 5 times in the end. I bit on like all of them too.

I ended up really liking Ratcatcher 2 when I literally didn't even know about the character before the trailers. She played a good ""little sister"" kind of role.

Bloodsport was cool, but I didn't necessarily come out caring about him so much, he takes the leader role convincingly, and Elba is a great actor, but the character was just kind of a stoic badass for the most part in a movie full of colorful characters so he kinda blends into my memories of the movie. He kind of felt more like a foil for Peacemaker mostly, so once Peacemaker left the movie, Bloodsport kinda faded away in my mind.

Margot Robbie is still a good Harley Quinn, and I like that the movie didn't really rely on her too much.

RIP Jai Courtney's best role, I knew everyone in the first team was gonna die off rip, but even so Boomerang went out fairly unceremoniously which is cool since it is the Suicide Squad.

Rick Flag was way better, and Viola Davis might be the perfect Waller.

Polka-Dot Man went out exactly how everyone who watched trailer 2 expected, and was also the only one to die from team 2 iirc (since Flag was on team 1). 

The movie did a great job making me care about a bunch of newly introduced characters even though they are villains.

Loved the movie, and loved that Task Force X was used more correctly than in the last movie. They weren't brought in to kill Starro (even though they ended up fighting Patrick) they were sent in to do a cover up for the American Government which is how they should be used.",oyxaam

Dunno why but the “Death Touch” scene really captured me

Terrific movie, 9/10",oyxaam

h8aapy5,This movie had just so much fun with their characters and the world that I just enjoyed all that they did. Also James Gunn has a way with giving weight and emotions to minor characters and I truly liked all the big and small characters on the screen.,oyxaam
h8akab9,"I just want to add that this was absolutely amazing in IMAX. If you can, see if there, if not see it in a theater or at least the biggest screen you can.

I’m watching it again on my tv and while it’s still good, I feel bad that some people won’t get to see the level of detail put into this movie. 

It was extraordinary on the big screen with the sound shaking you and hearing stuff fly everywhere.",oyxaam
h8b42jq,King shark is fucking cute lol . Poor guy  always gets left behind thugh,oyxaam
h8bjcjz,"That was a bunch of fun. Great action and outlandish Troma-level violence. And I can’t think of many people besides James Gunn who would think to use Starro in the movie. His inner tokusatsu fan must’ve been overjoyed—“WE GOT A MOTHERFUCKING KAIJU UP IN THIS SHIT!”

I’d compare the first 20 minutes to the X-Force fakeout in Deadpool 2. All these characters were in all the ads and they all get murdered in a hurry.",oyxaam

h8dphv6,I just finished it. Honestly way better than the first one. Obviously ridiculous but that's the fun. I think DC would do well to just lean into the wierd more. They're not going to beat Marvel at their own game and that's okay. I really enjoyed this more than probably any DC film so far.,oyxaam
h8mkh3l,"Something I rarely see mentioned these days... is how far CGI has come. People used to look down on heavy use of CGI - but honestly, these movies without CGI would be straight garbage. Starro's texture wasn't perfect, especially inside, but still good enough to believe it's real.   


The effects on Bloodsport's weapon animations were a thing of beauty.   


And how in the hell did they make Peacemaker's costume work? It just worked, despite being identical to it's 80s comics aesthetics.",oyxaam
h8nwi96,"I really liked this movie and the humour appealed to me a lot, BUT I feel I have a strong stomach for gore etc but this movie really pushed it for me almost a little too far. No idea why but the image of the little starfish coming out the big one nearly knocked me sick",oyxaam

h95riu6,"Gunn is really good about making me care about characters in a very short amount of time.

It's interesting Bloodsport doesn't feeling like a Suspiciously Similar Substitute to Deadshot. 

I love that the comedy didn't feel forced. Sometimes it's two assassins having a dick measuring contest while killing people, something's it's a shark man going ""FUCK"" because his disguise didn't work.

I also was 900% sure that the Justice League would show up and knock Starro down, leaving the Squad with zero credit.",oyxaam

I'm also so so glad I never watched a trailer for this. Suddenly seeing a giant red and blue starfish facing our team of ""heroes"" was great.

Also also, latino David Tennant is hot.",oyxaam
h8diluu,"One thing I don't think many people are talking about is how the team members actually reflected Waller's strategy and you can see her plan just through team comp.

Team B were the sacrificial lambs full of people who were, in Waller's mind, useless abilities wise (TKD, Weasel, Javelin), Traitors only out for themselves (Blackguard), cowards who would run (Savant), liabilities too crazy/stupid to control (Mongal, Harley, Boomerang), and a man who would have never gone through with the plan if told the whole story (Flagg).

Hell, when they mention Flagg survived, she even tells them to eliminate those holding them with extreme prejudice, knowing full well they are the resistance, as if they succeed they will 100% expose Starro as an American project. She didnt care one bit that Harley was kidnapped, only Flagg. She even specifically mentions infiltration via the Thinker because he has all the dirt on the project, and needs to be controlled or eliminated so he doesnt spill. Harley is only alive due to plot armor.

Compare to the A-team. You have an aquatic based heavy hitter that could maybe communicate with Starro and be unaffected by his powers in King Shark, a villain specializing in controlling small animals and maybe even warding off the mini Starros with Ratcatcher II, The only person who can do actual damage to Starro in Polka Dot Man, a man you completely control and trust to finish the true mission, and kill everyone else if they grow a conscience in Peacemaker, and finally someone with the skills, technical know how, and charisma to direct and keep those personalities in line in Bloodsport.

Compare that to the first film where the members where there because they were big names in the comics and had no real reason to be on the mission at all, and the difference is night and day.",oyxaam

The main thing I didn’t like was Harley with the foreign country’s president, a few deaths frustrated me, and the pacing was a bit odd at times. Other than that, this film took full advantage of its R rating with brutal yet glorious violence, it brought a lot of great action with appropriate music, and many funny moments. Great characters too. Bloodsport is much better than Deadshot, Rick Flag is much better here than he was in the first, Harley too, and King Shark is much better than Killer Croc.

Suicide Squad is one of the worst DC movies. The Suicide Squad is one of the best DC movies",oyxaam

I thought with how long Polk-Dot Man survived that he’d survive the whole movie, but nope (also frustrating). I thought Peacemaker actually died but nope (plot armor but cool character so that’s ok).

1. James Gunn must really hate birds

2. Bloodsport early on in the movie calls out that Peacemaker only uses peace as an excuse to do whatever he wants. Peacemaker insists that he only wants peace and that really is his driving motivation.

Except Bloodsport was 100% on fucking point. Peacemaker was going to kill Ratcatcher 2 initially because she had the hard drive. She gave it up, told him to destroy it. He pauses for a second because he realizes he doesn’t need to kill her. But he comes up with an excuse in time, “I’m thorough”.

Besides that, I adore this movie. I figured most of the cast would die, but the opening scene still had me laughing my ass off. Wishing we got more Javelin tho cause I love Flula Borg.

Peacemaker following Waller's orders without question shouldn't have been a surprise to me, and yet, I still hated seeing it.

Ratcatcher I think ended up being a favorite of mine, she was really solid. Sabastian was lovely as well.

The direction was fantastic as well, that opening scene was *chef kiss* really unpredictable for me. Wasn’t expecting a massacre that early, specially  since they sent Harley with them.

This movie wasn’t amazing, but it was entertaining throughout. I liked that first team helped set the tone that all these people including Rick Flag was expendable to Waller. I liked that this time around everyone was depicted to be actually some type of villian and has issues. I liked that the missions are assigned to them because it’s fuck ups from the government they don’t want the superheroes to know about. The first one I didn’t get why that specific team was set to try to save the world. The cast actually felt more like a ensemble vs the first one I just felt like it was a Will Smith movie.",oyxaam

h7w01v3,"I loved the King Shark ""Hulk, smash"" order from BloodSport. ""Big monster, Nomnom"".",oyxaam
h7w5qxq,"I loved it!

Thoughs, variously:

I think this is definitely a movie that the reaction will vary on taste. It really earned its R with the violence, nudity, gore, careless and wide-scale death and destruction, violence toward animals, etc. Absolutely what I went to see, but I can see it not sitting well with some people.

Next thing that really hit me was the clearly comic-like direction and editing. The 'in world' title cards, time jumps, and weird visuals like Harley's fantasyland, the reflection-in-the-helmet fight, the close up on the heart, etc., felt like stylish embellishments you might actually see in a comic. 

The performances were great. Admittedly, Bloodsport was interchangeable with Deadshot, but Elba is so much better of an actor than Will Smith so it's an upgrade to me. Cena's bravado turned to villainy was also really effective, especially contrasted against the 'brothership' the three of them had when they were out drinking and during the armored jeep breakout. And Robbie's still the perfect Harley and this is the best we've seen her. Her self-rescue was up there for one of the best sequences in the movie, particularly for the fact that it focused on an actual key Harley skill: it's her gymnastic ability that gets her out. And pretty amazing they managed to get actual touching moments out of Ratcatcher II's history and her friendship with KS. The fact that Polka-Dot Man and Thinker are both such goofy concepts is a real credit to their actors as well. Of course there's all the opening cameos too. 

Starro in a movie. I never thought I'd live to see the day.

But yeah, this is what I want to see. Obviously not all comic stuff can be this kind of material, but if you're going to do it, go for it. Be original, be over the top, just go for it.",oyxaam

Through all the good times and the bad that Gunn went through to get to this point and all the experience he had throughout making Guardians 1 & 2, he can be absolutely proud of his gore-filled bonafided masterpiece.

h7wzy4z,"This movie was really good. It was surprising in ways that I didn't expect a comic book movie to be and it doesn't feel like a 2 hour long commercial for the next one. This very much feels like whoever let James Gunn make this thought this was the last chance to do something with the project of a DC extended universe and it pays off with all the ridiculous weird shit and somewhat bold choices of a bunch of backbenchers who were pretty much jokes and that you could do shit like the opening beachhead scene. Some notes:

- The scene with Taiki and Ratcatcher 2 curing the climax, the score was odd. I was wondering why it sounded so Christmas-y and then I realized that the Ratcatcher 2 big theme sounds an awful lot like Alan Silvestri's music for The Polar Express. Very funny.

- King Shark was very funny, but I disagree he was the strongest of the team. Polka Dot Man was clearly a force to be reckoned with if he wasn't just a suicidal manic with mother problems. 

- This movie made me want to see a James Gunn Superman movie. Like I would like to see Gunn do something with the idea that Superman is basically all powerful but has to do this kinda shit and cant use his powers cause things need to stay secret. Secret agent Superman would be kinda funny to watch and it's never been done before.

- The setting of Corto Maltese felt incredibly Far Cry inspired, even though Gunn it probably looking toward more Commando and Predator inspiration. Probably the first time a video game premise has been faithfully rendered on screen ever and it's not a video game movie. Film makers who go on to make video game movies should probably watch this and remember that interesting plot, characters and writing always come first, not referencing gameplay and locations

- Seeing this movie now with the context of Scorsese comments, I can see why James Gunn would feel like he would want to be validated by Scorsese on this one. It's *very* Scorsese, even Tarantino inspired with the chapter titles, in moments from the needle drop soundtrack to the manic juggling of extreme violence to gallows humor. 

- This is the best rendering of Harley Quinn on screen. Birds of Prey tried, but this clearly understood the character and her actions better. She's properly insane so turning her into a girl boss and an allegory for professional managerial class people in New York City was always such a bizarre choice for a movie, but here you get Quinn as a fully realized character with proper motivation as well as *why* she's so dangerous as a villain.

- I am so glad that the only real connections to any extended universe are a brief mention of Star Labs and Superman. That's it. There's nothing else. You don't need a fucking textbook and a pen and paper to jot down all the references to other characters and future movies. No, this is the move you're watching and James Gunn clearly has respect for the audience to make you enjoy every minute of it.

- The opening is a great bait and switch. Gotta feel bad for Jai Courtney. Boomerang is probably the only role he's ever been in that he's been actually good in. Cause he was recently in that Jolt movie and he was terrible in that, and that's just in a mediocre movie. So getting offed in the first few seconds is pretty wild. Rick Flagg getting sacrificed by Waller was pretty surprising, but I think it only worked for me because I was thinking on the meta narrative of ""these guys were in the first one, there's no way they'd kill them cause they're the stars of the movie."" And I think Gunn treats the audience the same exact way. Rock Flagg was barely a character and I fucking doubt anyone remembers anything about him from that first movie other than the Katana meme line. And the entire opening is an effective way to get people invested back into Rick Flagg as a character.

- One thing I enjoyed was that they made a better Deadshot story with Idris Elba than with Will Smith. Smith probably has ten thousand stipulations in his contracts about how he needs to be seen on screen and Elba has none of that so you get great moments like the fact that he's an absolute dirtbag to his daughter and that yeah exploding bullets *are* cool. Bloodsport is self deprecating in ways I found myself realizing that Will Smith would never be on screen.

- Starro did seem like a Superman level threat and part of me does wish that one day someone will end one of these movies with the real heroes showing up and dealing with the big threat in like three seconds. But the fleshy eye and the millions of rats was an inspired way to draw everything together from the shit with the spear, to Bloodsport's rat fear, to Ratcatcher 2's (what a fucking hilarious name) acceptance. 

- I like the acknowledgment that a lot of these superheroes are just guys who use guns good.

- I take it James Gunn doesn't like birds.",oyxaam

That being said, I wish more time was spent on the new ""core "" suicide squad.  I really adored the new characters and was dying for more of them.  Ratcatcher was so damn enchanting, Polka Dot Man was just so fucking good, and King Shark is booming with potential.  Idris Elba can absolutely serve as an anchor for them, to me the finale where he's petting Sebastian sort of established his place on the team, half content with the madness but still bewildered.  When you compare this to Guardians, the reason that movie excelled was because of the strong focus on the core team and their relationships with each other, which I don't think this movie had as well. 

Not certain how you adjust the focus to give them more development, but I think the middle third of the movie you lose track of the core team?  Not certain what you do to correct that.  I'd hate to say you drop Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn (who continues to give it her all and deliver fantastic work), but I think if you remove her from the story you don't lose much, if anything.

h83748l,Wasn't quite my taste but I did enjoy Idris and Cena's characters. More than anything I'm glad Gunn used this as his redemption song.

I do think some of the comedic timing / jokes were a little…plentiful when not needed, but towards the back half I did start to chuckle a bit more. I think I just prefer darker comedies and some of it was a little too much, “hehe underpants haha this guy is a weasel” in the first half. 

Found myself caring about a damn shark man and rat woman way more than I thought I would, though. Some great fight scene choreography with the invasion of the camp and the reflection in the helmet. 

There were a few subtle things I found funny as well like PM’s disguise shirt being just a little bit too short and me totally catching that Milton did the walk in the rain scene with them and me thinking he was going to be a huge part of the mission.

Not sure if they will do another of these but I like the continuity of characters and yes, while we have 4 remaining plus Peacemaker, there is enough meat on the bone to pull another and then maybe even like bringing characters from the first film like Deadshot back.

Everyone's acting was okay too, even Cena (who was atrocious in F9 imo).

It has the whole edgy irreverent ""anyone can die at any time, for dumb reasons"" thing set up at the start to put the fear in you, and make you actually worried about the main characters surviving. Then it follows through on that promise, but is very restrained in doing so. Too often, a movie will either be terrified of killing off any of its main cast outside of maybe a final sacrifice, or it'll be too willing to down people in a way that feels mean-spirited and keeps you from getting invested. I was never worried for Harley and was very sure Bloodsport was at least making it to the last big action moment, but there were a lot of times I was actually scared one of the others was going to bite it out of nowhere.

edit: reminds me of a Community commentary I was watching/listening the other day. There's a scene where troy and abed are distracted by annie's boobs (her breasts, not the monkey) jiggling. And in the commentary they said wardrobe spent a bunch of time getting it so her boobs jiggle in a distracting way. and let me tell you, the jiggle of assistant girl in this put's annie's to shame.

sorry to be so crass, but it's right in your face. seems like something that would be in piranha 3dd. not that the suicide squad is an overly serious movie or anything, but there was very little sexualization at all in the movie, besides the one boob jiggle scene (and you kind of can see harley's underwear for a few frames.)

Also that there was plenty of modern songs in addition to oldies was great. My top favorite superhero films are Spider-Man and Black Panther, with both Guardians of the Galaxy films, the Avengers films, and Wonder Woman up there.

h80slul,This was actually really fucking good,oyxaam
h817yow,"Let me start off by saying, what an amazing movie. My expectations were high given all the word of mouth but I was still blown away! Absolutely fantastic, while I didn't watch the other movie(life's too short to spend watching movies everyone knows are bad), I believe there's absolutely no comparison to be made between them, just terrific! 8,5/10 for me!

It was very sad for me to see Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang basically show up to die though, I took his death as a statement of ""anyone can die"" even one the original three, but still, damn, his few lines made me crack up and really understand why he was so praised for the first film.

What made it worse was the titanium plot armor that was given to Harley Quinn. Gunn made a loud statement by killing off Boomerang(and a bunch of extras, who, let's be honest, we all knew would die) and then absolutely contradicted it his first chance. Don't get me wrong, by no means did I expect the biggest property in the film to be killed off, but I don't think there's a reason to make the one character you can't kill, the one who's put in sure-death situations the most(I got Arya flashbacks all over again). The third time around the emotion dies. You know she's just gonna laugh everything off and move on.

And let's talk about Harley Quinn. Her solo scenes were hands down the worst part of the movie for me. I felt like I was watching some sort of parallel story completely outside of the actual film. The(apparently) perfect guy being absolutely obsessed with her because she's ""special"" is just the cheap cliche that really shouldn't belong in this film(and it really wouldn't if she wasn't so popular in real life).

Furthermore, her interacting with the team was really funny, she got some giggles from me there(aside from the minute long joke about not knowing the name of that guy). But then whenever she was cracking jokes on her own scenes, it just didn't get to me. Maybe I'm not the target audience from her humor though, and I can absolutely understand that.

I also need to talk about John Cena. I was expecting nothing of him after Fast 9, he wasn't bad in it, he was just, neutral, I feel like anyone could have played that role and it wouldn't make a difference. But he's just so good in this movie. No one made me laugh as much as he did, even by just making over the top expressions at time.

He also was low-key scary when he killed Rick Flag, another character that I wasn't expecting to die. But then again, his character was overlapping with Elba's(there can only be one leader, and it was clearly Elba) so it was only a matter of time.

I still liked the use of Flag's character though. They could have done him the same way they did Cyclops in the X-Men movies(undermining him to make Wolverine, Bloodsport in this case, seem cooler), but they respected him and he was actually an integral piece of the movie. Its also nice that there wasn't any dick measuring competition between him and BS.

What else is there to say... Polkadot-man and Rat-catcher really surprised me, they turned out to be really interesting characters, I was not ready for the scenes with PDM's mom.

Idris Elba did his job. He wasn't particularly impressive but I blame the role for that. He's the standard action movie male lead with every trope in the book to make the audience care for him(he has a daughter; tragic backstory; is extremely important for Waller, the list goes on), it's really not surprising the role was meant to be for Will Smith to continue being Deadshot because they are essentially the same character.

Overall really good film, would recommend to anyone that isn't turned off by gore(R rating is also a nice factor in the movie.)

Let's hope this helps the DCEU crawl back to being an actual universe and not the classic ""throw it and see if it sticks"" Hollywood bullshit with nothing but contained movies or void sequels. But with Hamada in charge, I find that hard to happen.",oyxaam

h84hz70,"First off.... Did anyone else realize this movie and the 2016 are five years and a day apart???

h8di0o1,"This was such a wacky one for me! In the end, I had a good time with it, but it's definitely not going to be a film that I'll rewatch as eagerly as I thought. I think *The Suicide Squad* suffered for having way too many goals, many of which were directly at odds with each other.

**PROS:**

* The opening was really nicely done and I'm glad that I avoided spoilers, because some of the deaths genuinely surprised me. To some extent, I knew which ones were going to make it or were ""favored"" (Harley Quinn was never in danger), but it was nicely done. Maybe a little too close to *Deadpool 2*'s X-Force scene, but still.

* Loved the cast. It's been a while since Idris Elba was given a chance to really shine. Glad that we got Joel Kinnaman and Viola Davis back from the last movie. The big surprise was Daniela Melchior. Hadn't heard of her before but she *really* went for it, and I felt like it made her character the most relatable of the bunch. John Cena as Peacemaker was just something else, too. His nonchalant stabbing a dude to death in his sleep and selling those crazy lines was hilarious. Glad he's getting his own TV show.

* Again, I like how Gunn was basically allowed to scrape the bottom of the DC barrel for superheroes I'd never heard of, but still managed to make them feel like they belonged in the same universe as Batman or Superman. Never thought I'd love seeing Polka Dot Man on screen.

* *Love* that we saw much more of the Troma-era James Gunn here. There were some pretty brutal scenes in this film that harkened back to stuff like *Slither* and *Super*.

* Some of the action scenes were just nicely done. *Especially* Harley Quinn's escape.

* Starro, as a big bad, was pretty messed up and cool.

**CONS:**

* Why anyone would knowingly shoot so many action scenes at night is beyond me. I couldn't tell what was happening half the time, and it's like it was never daytime when it mattered.

* I like that, after having a personal/working relationship with both James Gunn *and* Joss Whedon for decades, Nathan Fillion finally got an actual role in one of these superhero films that wasn't just a voice cameo. Dude still needs a bigger role, though, but it was funny to see him as The Detachable Kid, of all characters.

* For as much as I enjoyed the characters here, I didn't necessarily... like them, or want to see them succeed... or even want to see them live. You can only portray your characters' brutality for so long before you kinda write them off emotionally. None of them really had many redeeming features, and all of their backstories are provided on the run in big ol' exposition dumps. It's, *I'd argue*, a far cry from stuff like the first *Suicide Squad*, where you at least had some flashbacks and scenes to show what the characters were all about (as blunt as they were).

 Gunn spends far too much time making his characters into happy-go-lucky murderers and defilers, that a third act turnabout that fully expects you to become emotionally invested in a bunch of murderers and defilers wanting to suddenly become heroes is pretty misguided from a writing perspective. Bloodsport and Peacemaker are just a couple days removed from a killing competition that resulted in the accidental murder of one of their allied factions. The last minute pivot to heroics is barely telegraphed and feels very out of place, mostly because all we truly know of our protagonists is whatever they dumped on us in their monologues--which doesn't do much to help an audience grow attachment. Amanda Waller has to explain Bloodsport's relationship *to* Bloodsport over the radio for us to get their relationship. Why bring Taika in for like a 15 second scene, and then have Ratcatcher 2's whole third act contribution build on that?

 Basically, I think we needed more. *A lot* more, for the third act to have the payoff that Gunn thought he had. At least Bloodsport got over his fear of rats? A budding friendship with Sebastian and getting over that fear was truly the only clearly-defined story arc in the movie.

 I personally think ending the movie after accidentally releasing Starro would've been pretty dang funny. Just having them call it a day like they intended to initially would've been more in character.

* Speaking of hastily-established things: we get a villain monologue from the Thinker out of nowhere, with very little establishment in the story itself, that... America was the true villain after all? And that they were working with the Nazis, or something? And based on the word of this villain who just admitted the raping an extraterrestrial starfish and murdering a bunch of innocents, Flag is going to go rogue? *Wat?* That whole part felt so tacked on and born more out of a need to mention America and Nazis in the same sentence than to create any kind of real twist.

* I have this notion of Amanda Waller as this super-ruthless character who will murder her whole staff *just because*, but she gets bonked and defeated by a random intern.

* In three separate instances, Gunn uses ""They murder children!"" to establish how terrible a character is. Four if you count Waller's threat to basically murder Bloodsport's daughter. Kind of endemic of Gunn's disinterest in writing anything that wasn't quirky or building towards a laugh.

Already too long, but it was really hard for me to *truly* enjoy the film like I was anticipating. I've loved Gunn's other works, both with Marvel, pre-Marvel, and even his side-projects like *Brightburn* and *The Belko Experiment*. (And if you haven't checked out his PG Porn series, I highly recommend it.) But just like the first *Suicide Squad*, this movie had designs on channeling the same *Guardians of the Galaxy* style, and even brought in the same director to make it happen.

But while GotG gave us *plenty* of time to get to know our characters, their motivations, and to watch them grow as a team... *The Suicide Squad* sacrifices that heart in favor of a more Deadpool-esque approach, where the zaniness and quips are the attraction, the backstories are kind of an afterthought, but with a weird third act that seems to think it's bringing all these sweeping story arcs to a graceful conclusion, and paying off this big emotional paycheck when the paycheck is actually bouncing.",oyxaam

Amanda was tough, strictl and not intimidated by no one, elements Davis captured perfectly on celluloid, but to my knowledge, she wasn't a cold-blooded killer and in David Ayer's movie, we see her murdering her crew just to keep her secrets from coming out.

Also, feel like the ""I am a superhero"" moment of Polka Dot man should not have been in the trailers. It felt so good to see him be so happy after being depressed throughout the film.The Harley escaping by herself should also not have been released in trailers. + Starro reveal + that scene of bloodsport shooting at starro, as it showed which characters would be alive upto that point.

2. Must say, when in the beginning we find out Waller straight up sacrificed a team just for a diversion, it was quite messed up and set her evilness up well.

3. The deaths of Polka Dot man and Rick flag were just so crushing. It really pains me that I won't get to see more films starring these characters. Specially Flagg just seemed like such an awesome guy, not a toolhead following orders.

James Gunn is a master of dark comedy.  There’s so many violent, brutal, and messed up scenes in this, that were also freaking hysterical.  But the film new when to get serious as well.

Margot Robbie was born to play Harley.  She is so good and I loved how they depicted Harley’s fighting style here.

This movie made Waller seem like far more of a monster, and Viola Davis can be terrifying when she wants to be.

John Cena was the big surprise of this move.  He was fantastic.  He managed to make Peacemaker both really funny, and downright scary.  And also humanize him to a degree.  I’m really looking forward to the Peacemaker show now.

Ratcatcher 2 was probably the character I ended up empathizing with the most.  Out of all of them, she was the one I wanted to survive the most.  And I hope we get to see her again in a future DC project.  Also more of that actress in general.  Breakout role for her hopefully.

It was sad to see Flagg (wow was he SO MUCH BETTER here than in the first film), Boomerang, and Polka-Dot Man go.  But I get why they were killed off.

h7yrsn0,"Something I like about Gunn is that he lets emotional moments breathe and usually doesn’t interrupt with a dumb quip, unlike the MCU. The scene with Ratcatcher and Bloodsport in the bus was so wholesome, as was Ratcatcher’s final memory of her father.",oyxaam

I wanted more of them.

I see why Peacemaker got a tv show. Hopefully is as funny",oyxaam
h7ze6so,"Feels like James Gunn has finally found his voice and sense of humor and made a great movie full of heart because of it. Loved every single moment, every single small story within the larger narrative, and loved ow everything was so polished from the tone and music to the raw and epic combat.  


So happy to have seen this guy grow so much from GOTG to now and I await the third Guardians movie with much excitement.",oyxaam

h7zusp8,"I have to give it to Viola Davis 


I think Waller is my most hated movie villain lol",oyxaam
h80b3sh,I kinda wished TDK survived.  I suppose he still could... they shot his arms not his body.  They could introduce him later on in the Peacemaker show with robot arms.  I love Nathan Fillion and I love 'superpowered' characters with very limited (to the point of being almost useless) powers.  Very relatable.  It would be funny to find that he got arrested because he accidentally groped a woman on the train while using his powers to keep the doors from closing.  The comedic situations he could get into week-after-week write themselves I tells ya!,oyxaam
h80b79t,Did anyone else fricking love the soundtrack of this movie? Did not expect to hear the Fratellis and I LOVE Hey by the Pixies,oyxaam

h80dn7s,I’m kinda sad most superhero movies tend to kill off villains that could be reused for later installments. Especially with starro cause he may be goofy looking but he could do some damage especially when he’s in more serious conquering phase. But overall a really great movie.,oyxaam
h80g2xv,"That nailed it look Nanaue gave after he said ""hand"" was great. Overall lots of great moments.",oyxaam
h80iadb,"So before I saw this movie all I remember was people on reddit saying it's a ""reboot"" with Margot Robbie reprising her role. Was that just a rumor that spread like it was fact this whole time? Because this definitely carries over characters and continuity from the previous suicide squad.",oyxaam
h80ifhh,I feel the way polka dot man died was a little underwhelming. He was one of the more major characters and to have him die just so randomly like that is weird to me.,oyxaam

h80li2l,Let this be a lesson that David Dastmalchian needs bigger roles.,oyxaam

h80yluz,The rat army that fought Starro were all played by the sentient rat actor Crisp Ratt,oyxaam
h810seq,"As someone who’s done with superhero movies, Suicide Squad was a ton of fun. A 9/10 for me.",oyxaam
h8110cv,"I enjoyed the movie a lot, despite a couple of qualms. Gunn directed the fuck out of the movie though. It was very funny, had great visual flair (I loved the text being formed out of stuff on screen), all of the characters were likable, acting was great. Just really solid all the way around. My two issues stem from narrative: 

1: as much as I adore Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, she felt really tacked on to this movie. It felt like she was a requirement, that Gunn had to include her in the movie, so he had to just kind of find stuff for her to do. Most of her individual scenes were really great, but they felt inconsequential to the overall narrative. 

2: like most ensemble movies, we didn’t get enough time with some of the characters for me to really care about them. I really loved Ratcatcher 2, but she was the only one that actually stood out. Bloodsport felt like the “main” character, but his plot with his daughter felt really weak. I bought his relationship with Ratcatcher more than I did with his daughter. Polka-Dot Man had a little bit of development but not enough for me to really develop a bond with his character. 

Those are pretty minor issues in the grand scheme of the movie though. This was generally the right kind of zany for a Suicide Squad movie and vastly superior to the 2016 movie. Very highly recommended.",oyxaam
h8112kc,"The shot looking against the Peacemakers helmet and the turning ""it's too dark to see any action"" on its head were amazing. This was a beautiful movie to behold",oyxaam

Great movie overall though. Gives off  Gail Simones Secret six vibes, which I hope James Gunn makes in the future.",oyxaam
h830pa0,"I loved the agents in the room choosing to go against waller and do the right thing. It had the same vibe as the ""cap's orders"" scene from Winter Soldier and to me it's part of what makes a superhero movie good. The everyday people doing good, meaningful things, even at their own expense and not involving stunts or explosions.",oyxaam
h83g6s7,The action team behind it all was an Australian/New Zealand team. I wonder how much that contributed to the action have a different feel compared to the usual teams Marvel and DC hire to do the action.,oyxaam

h84e77c,"Man this movie was hilarious. Really makes me wish that DC had a coherent plan and was trying to create a universe like this, but with it being more violent and darkly funny to contrast the MCU.",oyxaam
h84ea37,"I wanted to love it, it is a James Gunn movie after all. I just liked it though. The first act, just perfection. I greatly enjoyed the beginning & felt I was finally going to see a DC movie that was good the whole way through. However, once we hit after Harley rejoins them, it just dragged for me. It's alright.",oyxaam

The arms would easily pop off.  When I saw TDK, I actually thought of [""Cyclotron"" from that toy line](https://i.imgur.com/WI7r8nq.jpg)... similar color scheme and sleeveless arms.  Cyclotron wasn't a very popular DC character so I just imagine kids in the 1980s pulling off the arms and calling him ""The Detatchable Kid"" or something",oyxaam

h8a54pw,"Brilliant. Just great fun.

Idris Elba is so good when written well.

Cena killed it, especially the shock of killing Flagg and then trying to justify killing Ratcatcher 2.

Overall, guardians is a far more polished product IMO.",oyxaam

I really like how they introduce the characters in the movie even the villains.

Characters that died in this movie is better than what happened to Slipknot. Any character could  die except for some big name celebrity. I guess some fans will hate it seeing their favorite characters from dying.

Only issue I found in the movie. Bloodsport and Deadshot have similar background story. Totally wish Bloodsport background story is a bit unique.

I guess Deadshot supposed to be in the movie but replaced by Bloodsport. Don’t get me wrong Idris Elba really nailed his role. I really like he wear his helmet same thing with Peacemaker.

I really like Peacemaker character. The movie didn’t humanize his action. He is just a psychopath that loves to kill. He just use peace as his motivation.

Totally wish they did it the same with Bloodsport. Hopefully Bloodsport will be seen again.",oyxaam

h8i0y7m,"It was enjoyable. I don’t know if I liked it as much as everyone else did though. The emotional backstories felt very clunky. Like it was hitting me over the head while screaming at me “this is where you’re supposed to feel sad”. It’s a superhero movie so I don’t expect life changing emotional scenes, but it was so forced that it had the opposite effect and took me out of movie.

Also the 69 joke was *painfully* unfunny and made me physically cringe. It’s probably the one thing I really, really hated. All the other humor ranged from okay to hilarious, but the 69 joke was brutal.

Other than that I thought it was a very solid popcorn flick",oyxaam

The scene with bloodsport arguing with his daughter over the TV watch cracked me up. 

But the scene where they absolutely steam role the freedom fighters in the camp and find Flagg chilling with their leader is one of my favorite comedic scenes of all time. Their voices, the confusion on their faces, the implications of what you just saw, them trying to bullshit their way out, fucking hilarious.",oyxaam

h7x95uj,"Technically very solid. Gunn is a real talent.

However TSS didn't really do much for me at all. The jokes fell flat and I didn't connect with any of these characters. It wants to be nihilist and edgy but will pivot to sweet and familiar when it needs to tick some narrative boxes.

People seem to love Peacemaker, I found him to be barely a one dimensional character. Doesn't help that John Cena isn't very good in this, the costume does most the work. Will be interesting to see how the show plays out.

Not for me but people generally really seem to love it and heaven knows we need more folks to enjoy a movie on the big screen at this time!",oyxaam

The humour wasn’t that great, they killed off Flag and Boomer (some of the only good characters from the first movie), Idris felt like he was just the token black replacement for Will Smith’s character, and the action wasn’t as fun to watch as it was in Birds of Prey. Plus, they’re giving a spin-off show to the asshole who tried to kill Ratcatcher (and killed Flag)? Why would I want to see more of that dickhead?

It was better than the first movie, but that’s not saying much. This felt like a Guardians ripoff without the heart or humour :/",oyxaam

h80rzf1,"Really dug how much weight the movie carried. Not only in feeling suspense for the characters but also the set pieces. Especially near the end as the tower is collapsing. In other super hero movies it just looks and feels like it’s breaking down into powder. Here, it actually felt like the building was a threat with each crumble amplifying the need to get away from it. 

The “Kaiju” also felt like a genuine threat and scaled perfectly with the city. Really had me guessing how taking it down would feel genuine and not half-assed.

h8faiy4,"Overall I liked it. One thing that bothers me though, and this isn't necessarily a problem with the movie itself, but Harley Quinn as a character just makes no sense to me. And I don't mean she's not believable in a real world kind of way, she just makes no sense from a character perspective. Like is she crazy or not? She's some kind of super material arts master and weapons expert? She used to be a psychologist who presumably has multiple degrees, but half the time acts like a ditzy airhead and falls madly in love with the most obviously evil guy in Gotham? There are times (not just in this movie) where the writing of her character feels borderline misogynistic.

None of it adds up to a person who at least seems ""possible"". I never have any idea what's motivating her at any given moment, aside from the obvious reduced jail time thing. I haven't read the comics or watched the cartoon so maybe I'm missing something.",oyxaam

h80l291,"I'm seeing so many positive reviews and comments about this movie, and I completely disagree. Outside of the first 5-10 minutes and a stray moment here and there, I thought the movie was a boring, unfunny slog.

(Spoilers coming)




- Half the ""jokes"" were basically just people cursing. Yelling ""Fuck"" isn't the same as an actual joke. Same for saying ""Milton"" 50 times.
- All the villains were super boring with no personality. All the resistance fighters were also super boring, and the whole Corto Maltese political stuff just sucked. I couldn't care less about the hard drive that drove the fight between Peacemaker and Flag. I was like ""Just fight a fucking giant starfish already! Who cares about these fucking military guys?""
- Harley's entire kidnapping subplot contributed nothing and ended with a painfully uninteresting action scene where she just kinda shoots a lot of guys. She shouldn't be in this movie.
- Bloodsport is just re-named Deadshot. Black guy who's an expert with any weapon coerced by Amanda Waller because of his daughter. That's pretty lame.
- Any scene where a character stops to explain their backstory is needlessly somber and dull, especially Ratcatcher 2
- The movie shines most when it feels like a superhero movie, like Guardians of the Galaxy. Unfortunately, it mostly feels like a military movie made by a horror director.
- The mission control people could have been a fun running commentary of things, but they're barely used.

I feel tricked and lied to by James Gunn. I thought this was going to fix the mistakes of the first one, but it was just garbage.",oyxaam
h7w907h,It didn’t work for me. Some good comedy and cool scenes but the pacing was all off. It would ramp up one scene and then immediately chill out. That happened over and over again. Lots of music video type scenes with loads of effects and a song in the background got old for me. Definitely better than the first one but this was a disjointed mess.,oyxaam
h7w30pl,"Maybe, my expectations were to high because of all the great reviews. But I didn't  like it. Thought it was way to long. Weird but not in a good way.  On the way out of theater, I was thinking about how much better The Boys TV series does the anti hero, gore and comedy.

The best scene IMO was the opening beach sequence. But this joke was already done in Deadpool 2. And done better IMO because I didn't expect it. I didn't care Rick Flag died. I felt nothing for him as a character. The jokes fell flat. The mission was kinda lame. No, real villain just a bunch of random soldiers being ripped apart.

Polka dot was great.

Flag was brilliant and well written
Harleys best appearance so far.
Bloodsport becoming that leader is believable

Everything else landed really weird and the plot was lurching. I'm also pretty disappointed that this King Shark is nothing like Funches' King Shark in Harley Quinn the animation. 

I can appreciate the irony of Peacemaker, but it just didn't land emotionally for me. 

4/10",oyxaam

h7w8599,"I didn’t like this whatsoever. The humor was almost always painfully unfunny, the characters felt surprisingly two dimensional, the exposition was almost as clunky in the first film, the plot sort of grids to a sudden half at least twice, and it sort of feels incoherent at points.

I feel like people are judging it against the first movie (or at least 80% of other DCEU films) instead of weighing it as a standalone. It’s absolutely the better film, but I still wouldn’t consider it more than a 4/10.",oyxaam
h85c640,"Edit: At some point in the future, people are gonna sort by controversial, see this post and then slowly the downvotes become upvotes lol. Happens every time.

Very forgettable movie. I'm surprised it had such high ratings. The problem with this movie is that it's too long for what it is, and after some point, you just sit there in a haze. Everything's chaos, and nothing really has any impact when you see a poorly animated giant starfish just tumble everywhere. Every character is invincible and there are no real stakes to anything. No catharsis, no satisfying ending.

Giving characters 3 minute backstories and trying to make it sentimental, like rat girl's... doesn't work. Show, don't tell. No exposition is the number one rule of storytelling. 

Humor was somewhat hit or miss. Some parts had the theater giving audible laughs but most jokes landed flat. It felt like DC tried to ""copy"" the Marvel formula and just overshot it to the point of it looking like a poorly made parody. Like the part where they go through the camp murdering the people they're supposed to be working with was hilarious. But Shark man going ""hurrrr durrrr Im a dumber version of Hulk if that was even possible"" got old SO fast.

6/10 for me.",oyxaam

h8i4v20,"This could’ve just been Harley’s escape sequence and it still would’ve been better than the original Suicide Squad, but no, they went ahead and just said “fuck it” and then proceeded to make a movie that just completely erases the bad taste that mess left the branding of The Suicide Squad stuck with by creating an utterly awesome, batshit insane, vibrant, hilarious, superhero (or supervillain I guess) movie, with characters that are so vastly improved upon from the first outing. 

Rick Flagg and Harley Quinn feel significantly more realized and likable, especially the former, with Harley already having benefited from Birds of Prey before this. Elsewhere, Viola Davis returns with an even more crazed version of Amanda Waller that is a perfect antagonist for the team. And then there’s the new faces… Ratcatcher 2, Polka Dot Man, Peacemaker, King Shark, and Bloodsport, who just work so fucking good with one another on-screen. 

Absolutely loved this, thrilled it exists, can’t wait for Peacemaker on HBO MAX, and hopefully they can get Gunn back for a sequel down the line after the man takes a (well-deserved) break after GOTG 3.",oyxaam

At one point we paused it for a bathroom break and were horrified that there was still 30 minutes to go.

I couldn’t keep track of all of the characters. At one point there was a joke about a random unnamed character being killed and it wasn’t funny because like, yeah that’s possible since I literally can’t keep track of them all. Maybe that *was the joke?* I don’t know, because all the jokes were incredibly cringe to me.

Also blood and gore isn’t a plot device.

If you went to a real prison, it wouldn’t be filled to the brim with villains in there for horrid acts forever angry at society, some people would be there for more reasonable crimes, some people would have learned from their wrongdoings. None of the characters feel like straight comic book villains (at least from this perspective), they all feel like people in prison for different crimes.",oyxaam

The way they introduced that these characters actually have real consequences, separating itself from almost every other superhero movie out there, was great. There were a few key flaws like in some parts I thought either the acting or pacing was a bit off or maybe the humor just didn’t really hit but the good definitely outweighs the bad. I also really enjoyed the common idea that the film uses that all characters are flawed, where as other superhero movies even in the same franchise have these perfect heroes that only are fighting for “the good of the world”. They even make fun of this concept with the inclusion of Peacemaker where the character is driven by “liberty” and the film mocks him for this the entire time. I wasn’t too fond of King Shark as he is the common dumb comic relief trope used in a lot of these type of movies but at some points they do some fun stuff with him. Other than that though I enjoyed a lot of the characters despite some being rather one-sided. Overall it was pretty good and definitely deserves some praise, while not perfect, it’s easily one of the top superhero films of recent years and definitely separates itself and cements itself as something different and confident in its new ideas.",oyxaam

Likes;

- Cgi and visuals are pretty great .king shark and starro look great and never once did stop to question cgi and considering it involves a giant starfish smashing a city and it doesn't come off as silly is so highly commendable, shots in the rain are incredible.

- Action is also pretty great. Loved it went for the full r rating and gruesome. Jungle scene when they are taking down the rebels and releasing it later was peak gold was so hilarious.

- Humour works fine for the most part and doesn't land every time but it never reaches cringe level and it doesn't overstay it's welcome. Milton gag was so worth the wait bse I was confused why he was around and this is one of the best pits of directing from gunn in the movie.

- Really liked the squad for the most part ,had issues with harley;

Elba stole the show ,all his facial expressions are just so Good and he just had the best pieces of dialogue

Rat-catcher 2 was so likable and the heart of the film. Never imagined I would care for sebastian a fricking rat.

King shark was so adorable yet so lethal,him chowing the solidier's head and ripping the another solidier in half is gruesome. Also liked him finding friendship arc.

Didn't expect to like cena and Rick flag and polkadot man too.

Loved their powers and weapons.


Dislikes;


- it jumps through points in time which can feel disjointed at times. It drags at points in the second act.

The whole plot btn harley and the president was just pointless in the movie and out of place. And it felt so contrived. That whole scene should have been cut.

The scene were they are all  threatening the thinker , harley is kind of annoying and is the only moment I came close to cringing.

With exception of action sequences and the milton gag ,harley doesn't do much in the movie . That scene with her in starro's eye is just for the beautiful visuals.

The only thing I wished was different was that, they 

1. Had used the Thinker a bit more and explained what he actually does besides, work on Starro.

2. Explained what the villains that died in the beginning did a little bit more, like TDK was pretty self explanatory and they showed his power pretty good, but Blackguard, Savant, Mongal, and Javelin.
I had to look them up to even see what they did because they were just sorta, people who got shot, at least Mongal had some sort of super strength or was just really heavy despite how she looks when she brought down the helicopter.

However, it embraces the ridiculousness of the movie which helps and hurts in my opinion. I was sort of bored just because I didn’t feel like there were established stakes. Whether for Corto Maltese or Starro. I didn’t really ever feel invested in the outcome of the mission or any of the main cast after the opening scene. I was hoping they’d live but only Flagg and ratcatcher had any emotional pulls on me. 

I think suicide squad is hard to do from “scratch” and works better when there is more pre established context to the world and consequences of the mission. It feels like it was made for people who already have knowledge of the comics (which I do), but I want the DCEU to have at least some appeal.

The MCU was becoming extremely sterile and bland leaning entirely on epic plots, barren colorless cinematography and Avatar-esque scores until Gunn came in and finally added in some personality and charm.

I understand if you are adapting Joker or Batman if you wanna make something super realistic and shy away from the comic book-y elements of the Dark Knight, but you’re making a goddamn comic book superhero movie...have some fun with it and pull from the pages with weird and out there stuff...it’s all there already.

Gunn and Waititi absolutely revitalized the genre with films that didn’t shy away from batshit costumes, weird characters and plotlines that went in insane directions. And thankfully you can tell their impact was well observed by the higher ups.

There is something absolutely delightful and creative and just absurdly fun when you really stop and think about what you’re watching on screen. In this case of The Suicide Squad that moment for me was when I was witnessing an absolutely marvelously shot clown woman floating in the cosmic goopy eye liquid of a kaiju space starfish as thousands of rats swam around her and began gnawing on the monster’s entrails. Like....wtf!? But that’s what a comic book film SHOULD BE. Have fun with it and make the craziest concepts happen.

Gunn proved that once again with this film. From the goofy costumes of Peacekeeper to the piranha alien fish that tried to kill King Shark...don’t think your audiences only want cool and serious and grounded crap. Be weird. It’s a comic book movie, dammit.

(If MCU was anything like DC now, Fing Fang Foom would totally show up in Shang Chi with his goofy ass pants for sure. And I'd be thrilled)",oyxaam

h8awrzg,"Overall I enjoyed the film, but it's definitely not a 5 out of 5.

How they introduced each team was great; really loved the beginning overall (minus a few things). Lots of nice shots and transitions too.

The Weasel drowning scene and TDKs arms were hilarious.

Some fat definitely could be trimmed from the whole film; I found myself losing attention toward the end.

VFX/CGI was hit or miss.

The whole Starro thing felt bland and completely lacked any stakes or tension.

I would love to see a version where they cut out Harley. Nothing against the character or actress, but I don't feel that she added anything to the movie. She now exists to make money for WB.",oyxaam
h8c6wel,"A few questions. How is Harley Quinn Johnwicking. That starfish never created anything useful to the scientist except a threat of uncontrollable violence. Why was Amanda Waller over the top mean and assholey, why was she sacrificing Harley Quinn and Rick Flag in the 1st team mission then trying to save Rick with the 2nd team?",oyxaam
h8craku,"Even though i loved the Ratcatcher 2 scene in the end and it was a perfect way to defeat Starro, i would have loved for the movie to end with the Suicide Squad leaving, Starro taking over the island and James Gunn directing a Justice League movie where the League has to take on Starro as soon as Waller realizes that the starfish doesnt stop after the island. Might have been a bit worse of an ending for the characters in this movie, but oh well, they are supposed to be villains anyway right?

Besides that idea, I really enjoyed the movie. No boring part in it.",oyxaam

h7wdzr2,"It would be nice if the so called bad guys/anti heroes actually did badguy things instead making a 180 then being heroic.  Just walk away and go home let the country burn, it would have added to gunns trite politics. I get it America is bad but why do you have add the awful pop music as people are being killed? The message gets muddled with all the ironic jokes. In the end credits when the blonde says the line about ""saving the world""  was that Ironic or serious couldn't tell it was too cringy. 

Also Idris surfing down the building as it fell has to be dumbest thing i've seen in a movie. It came right after a ""touching"" death scene which was jarring. 

The tone is all over the place and the politics wants you to feel bad for the people and criticise America. But it's also trying to be fun quirky action comedy which comes of as trite. 

If you want edgy (like this movie is trying to be) I suggest Ramb4 that movie at least had balls to have kids murdered on screen. 

Slither is still gunns best movie in my opinion, go watch that instead it's also shorter and funnier.",oyxaam

Kinda miffed in the dumbest of ways that they kill off so many characters at the beginning the way they did though, I get why but… eh. 

Wayyyyy more of an improvement over the first that’s a given.

h8c4k28,"Wow wow wow what a great fucking movie! By far James Gunn's best.

h825zhr,"Yeah I didn’t enjoy this much. There were a few high points (king shark), but there were major issues. The “R” rating just threw in a bunch of F bombs and violence when the writers ran out of ideas.

There were still major pointless exposition dumps all through the movie (same beats as the first one). It approached cleverness at times but still a major disappointment to me.",oyxaam

h83arzp,"OK... so I've been ruminating...

There are a lot of comments here about ""OMG BEST EVER!"" and on the flip side ""MOVIE IS SHIT!""

I think both of those statements are pretty ignorant. I enjoyed the hell out of the movie, but it's not without criticism and if you're going to just reply ""movie is shit"" you better be prepared to say why or STFU.

There is a LOT to like about the movie. King Shark is fucking GOLD in every scene he's in. I can't tell if he's a human turned into a shark or a shark turned into a human, doesn't matter, he's the wild eyed innocent when he's, you know, not being a shark.

Starro the Conqueror, man, never thought I'd see it and they did it credibly and super creepy. Having the Starro-zombies be fatally attached is much darker than the comics where you can peel the starfish off and be OK. Makes more sense this way.

Polka-Dot Man's mom issues was hilarious.

Now the bad... It REALLY drags in the middle. The opening scenes, invading the beaches, that's cool... The end with Starro is freaking amazing, but the hour or so in between? Eh... erm... Could have been tightened up.

Three key sequences in the middle piece: 

1) ""Rescuing"" Flagg from his ""captors"".  

2) Harley's ""make her pretty and get her laid"" sequence.  

3) Harley's (self) Rescue.  

One of these things is not like the others and can absolutely go. Cut from Harley in the hole to Harley being tortured by the general, the scene in the middle is un-necessary. Killing the President had ZERO impact on how the movie turned out, he could have been in the room where the rebels gunned everyone down, no difference.

For point 3, a bunch of people enjoying the sequence, I thought it was just OK. I liked the flower effects and Disney animals, but realistically, Harls going nuts on a bunch of armed guys was done BETTER in the police station in Birds of Prey.

I get it, not a lot of people saw that one, it's a decent flick. Same stunt choreographer as John Wick and that sequence kicks the crap out of the fight sequences in this movie.

The WORST part of the movie is the giant rat army at the end.

Close up? Looks fine. All the rats cuddling with Taika Waititi and kid to keep them warm? Adorbs.

Zoom out to show the scope of the rats running through the city and attacking Starro? Looks... like... ass...

I get it, it's hard to show rats at that scale and distance, but it just looked awful.",oyxaam
h844dvf,"This movie was fucking phenomenal. Pretty much all the characters were likable in some way, unlike the original. It had plot, unlike the original. You felt satisfied with the ending, unlike the original.

That close up shot of his face when he's about to >! shoot that rat girl !< and his action sequences and overall acting right before >! the thing with Flag and the HDD !< were really great.....  The stealth action sequence he did with Idris at the rebel camp was worth a mention too.,oyxaam
h8esjve,"This movie was absolutely fantastic.

Completely shits on the original in every way. It's enormously funny, the action is super entertaining, the characters are somehow properly developed admist the backdrop of a crazy plot. I geuinely liked all the main characters. The cinematography is also great, with a lot of beautiful looking shots.

h8br65h,"Really shocked that it's getting such good reviews. This movie was a series of scenes, some of which were admittedly funny. But there was no significant narrative connecting them.

* The relationship with Bloodsport and his daughter was at best weird.

* It wasn't visually as fun as the original. 

* None of the characters (possibly excepting Peacemaker and to a lesser extent Ratcatcher) are ever really given much characterization and we're just driven by the spectacle.

* CGI on King Shark and Starro was bad.

* They didn't even turn over the flash drive at the end, which effectively means Flag and Peacemaker died for no reason.


Like 3-4/10",oyxaam
h81wuji,"What was with the harleyquin side plot with the guy that was in love with her. So boring, pointless and broke the phasing of the movie.",oyxaam
h872s4t,"Hi everyone,

I feel like my thoughts will get downvoted into oblivion based on everyone's responses to the movie and the current reviews, but am I the only one who was incredibly disappointed in this movie.  To me it felt like guardians of the galaxy if nothing made sense.  All of the weird stuff seemed to just be in there for the sake of being weird without having an actual purpose to the story.  For example polka dot man throws polka dots, there is a shark who is not smart and honestly why did he have to be there.  I can't think of one thing the shark did that had an impact on the movie.  Harley Quinn went from battle, to almost married, to prison in a matter of minutes.  They tried to make the rat girl have a heartwarming background with her father but it just seemed to be out of place.  

On the positive side I don't think John Cena and Idris Elba could have been any better, they were both FANTASTIC in their roles.  Overall though the idea of battling a giant starfish who wanted to take over the world I guess for some reason just seemed to be so absurd without having add to any potential future storylines.

Overall 5/10, I honestly don't think it was much better than the first suicide squad and I really wanted to like this movie before seeing it. 

TLDR: I feel like I'm the only one who thought this movie made no sense and wasn't good",oyxaam
h7w9sfn,Hard meh.,oyxaam
h7wd1mk,"King Sharks cgi is terrible, right?",oyxaam
h80248c,I can't even believe I was so excited to watch this move because of James Gunn. I literally turned it off after an hour of watching it. This is just brutally bad.,oyxaam
h803iyu,Honestly felt like even the first suicide squad was better. How did idris run faster than starros leg to save ratcatcher but polkadot man gets insta blasted? Also couldn’t stat to just crush rat catcher as she’s waving her wand and the rats would just leave him alone? Also how did they run up the floor in the building it as it was collapsing when the tile was literally soaked seconds earliar. How is this movie 90%. And why didn’t Waller just blast their heads all open? If she did no one would find the hard drive lol and after her employee knocked her out how was that employee still working at that job? Lmfao,oyxaam
h80uo0a,"I'm the only one who, dare I say, dislike this movie? It felt hypocritical, brutally with no just deserts, kills were not funny, very cynical toward good characters (King Shark, Ratcatcher, Polka Dot Man, Rick Flag), tonal dissonance, no good character setup, and terrible third act. 

I have no problem with gore, but the movie just doesn't understand just deserts or irony. 

The Boys is perfect example of balancing shock value, dark humor, and satire, but this movie is like Guardians of the Grindhouse (not in a good way). 

On the positive side, I do love the main cast of characters besides John Cena.",oyxaam
h834lqy,"Honestly don't get the hype for this one. I thought it was ok but nothing special. Wonder woman and aquaman were better than this in my opinion.

The main bad guys were a bunch of generic army men,why not have an actual antagonist.

The thinker just went along with the plan to destroy his project, you would think he would have least put up a fight about it but he was like ""you want to destroy my work,ok want my car as well?'

Some of the cgi was not that great,there was one point where bloodsport fell through the building and it looked like bad green screen like you would see on a made for TV movie.

Harley Quinn was reduced to a damsel in distress for almost half the movie which doesn't sit right for a character like Harley Quinn

Most jokes did land and the soundtrack was great,the soundtrack was the main highlight of the film.

This film was ok but nothing special,overhyped in my opinion, certainly not one of the best comic book movies and certainly not one of the best DC movies.",oyxaam
h7x5ebn,"For the love of me i didnt laugh once and i love guardians of the galaxy, i thought this movie was very disjointed and kinda aimless,the story was by the numbers and very predictable (but that is ok i guess for the genre) It felt like a bunch of scenes stitched toghether with bad pacing, cant believe the praise its getting either, theres barely any action on it also, most of the action scenes are cut off either too soon or you dont see much at all, if you look at this movie objectively and look specialy at the scenes and the action scenes specificaly, there arent many on it..

Theres the assault on the jungle in the begging, nothing rly happens here, except dissapointment when it comes to most of the interesting chars, seriously why did they made a fuzz about the marketing on some of these chars when they are in the movie for 3 seconds?! It wasnt funny or impactful, it was anoying to kill all those chars after all the promo they did with them and how great the actors said it was to play them, rly? for the whole 5 sec screen time?

Theres the second assault on the jungle and its mostly a shooting gallery, very scripted and stale, for 5 min, with bloodsport and peacemaker competing against each other with some poor choreography... and than theres like an hour of movie where nothing happens, they hang out at the jungle drinking beers with some more poorly made jokes, theres a scene with harley using the pole on the soldiers and that was cool ill give it that and theres the ending scene where bloodsport shoots a bunch of shots at the giant star and the rats eat it.

I dunno man, i think movies like xmen, deadpool 1 and 2, and many other examples,  have a lot of action pieces on them and these scenes are longer than 2 min for sure, this movies jokes fell flat for me and the action scenes are very brief and unimpressive, theres a bunch of slow motion cgi gore that seems like its just there to try to save the movie from beeing dull but thats it.

The dialog is clunky and the actors always seem off beat/sync with each others jokes,i got a feeling that ppl that think this is good (i still respect it though)are either massive james gun fans, with good reason, i think GOTG is a much much better film than this and the humor is a million times better, or they dont want to slam movies because they want ppl to go to the movies (wich is understanding too but conflicting for me)

I dont want theaters to die, but saying this is a 9/10 on IGN and other outletsis straight up lie, this movie is about a 6 when it comes to super heromovies, ppl got too easily impressed with some brief gore/actionscenes or the fact that the first movie was criticaly slammed so this MUST be better right? Its james gun, it MUST be better, wich imo isnt rly, and to be fair.

The first movie has a lot of flaws and its also a 6/10 but its less disjoined mess and the dialog is actualy better, the tone is consistently darker on the first movie also, this movie is totaly all over the place .. just my two cents, if you like this movie, fair enough, good for you, but as someone watching these since the very first blade movie that opened the doors to all these marvel movies back in theaters in 1998, wow, its bad imo, objectively bad.

Some ppl are calling this a masterpiece and things like james gun can do no wrong, i understand clammoring for theaters to come back, but lets do it with actual good movies, not this...i wonder how many movies some of these ppl watched before this, this movie felt like a fake out, like theres a lot of scenes where they give you the ilusion that theres action about to begin or some movement but nothing rly happens, its basicaly 2 fake out assaults in the begging at the beach, harley plays princess with some guy , the squad drinks beers for what feels like pacing wise an hour at the bar and than they go recue harley and again nothing happens because she doesnt need saving, they than go and throw a bunch of rats at the startfish and the movie ends.   


The shark does look good but they dont do much with him either, they dont do much with neither of them actualy, the only good scenes are the ones in the trailer, nobody mentions this?? I heard a critic say bloodsport has the best fighting choreography in the movie, he basicaly punches a few guys in the jungle for 5 seconds, that is crazy to me.",oyxaam
h7x6zlk,"Welp judging by overall sentiment here this wont go well but I hated this movie so much, not even disliked no I hate it. So many plot holes and tons a fluff. One of the biggest things for me was Harley's jumping into staro's eye when considering it just ripped through several buildings and was shot to all shit is just ridiculous. None of the villains were remotely satisfying and poorly written imo that includes Waller( she should be dead or in critical condition you dont just take a golf club to the back of your skull and go back to work after you wake up) who acts like a complete child instead of some corrupt mastermind politician. 

Sure the movie had a few funny moments but ultimately I think this movie was crap",oyxaam
h7yrr47,"How the hell did this movie get made? Like holy shit. That level of anti US rhetoric usually gets licensing rights / grants shot down by the pentagon pretty quick.

When the first trailer read 'FROM THE HORRIBLY BEAUTIFUL MIND OF JAMES GUNN', I'm sure I wasn't the only mind who felt it a bit cringey but my god, this movie was like staring straight into his mind. The structure was creative and unique to the genre, they used every member well and made them memorable, beautiful cinematography and soundtrack; Gunn really gave depth and personality to each character in a short time. There were somethings that I personally didn't like: felt the constant titles were kinda jarring and also some cheesy moments in between but far more positives than negatives for sure. That scene where Harley was butchering everyone with flower confetti coming out instead of blood is definitely Gunn's magnum opus. Also, finally my boy Idris gets to shine in a great movie! 



I honestly thought I was having a superhero genre hangover but this movie was just so refreshing, kinda felt like when Logan came out and rejuvenated my love for comicbook movies again. The Suicide Squad may not win an Oscar like it's predecessor but it's 10 times the better movie. A definitely rewatchable 9.3/10 for me!

h88ccru,"I thought this was OK. Pretty underwhelmed with the action, mainly the gunfights and hand to hand combat. Had a lot of impressive explosions though so it is a bit of a mixed bag for me.

I liked that this movie felt like an arc from Ostrander's SS run. Having the SS doing covert missions felt like a return to form. Characterizations of Flag, Harley, and Waller were great and I thought they were adapted very well from the source material. Nice showcase of everyone's abilities too.

I'm not too familiar with Gunn's work or his tropes , but the music being employed for certain scenes felt a bit random or on the nose to me. Cool of him to make the music diegetic by coming out of speakers near characters I guess. Corto Malteseans really like old school rock music, eh?

The rest of the movie did just enough to be good. Characters like Bloodsport get simple arcs (non-leader to leader) and the team gets to bond again at a bar like in the 2016 movie. The bonding was just done a little better by...having them drink and dance a little more. I'm still a bit confused about Bloodsport's affinity with Ratcatcher saying that she reminds me of his daughter outta no where but it is what it is lol.",oyxaam

\*Thinker to Flag\*: ""Uncut your fucking pearls"" - isn't this a reference to ""Uncut Gems"" movie that has 560 F-bombs? I'm not sure what else to think of it, as a non-native speaker this phrase seems like an unfamiliar idiom to me.",oyxaam

h8en6jj,"I give it a 6/10, could be 7. Overall a well made movie.  The humor was generally good.  I liked the main characters.  Was surprised Davidson was only in for 5 mins tops, hah (not a criticism, just an observation).  

It was probably 15-20 mins too long though, at times it felt a little indulgent.  I didn’t really care for the final battle scene with the starfish and how it met it’s demise with the rats, it just wasn’t satisfying or fun.  The rat girl wasn’t that pivotal of a role to the overall story for that ending to really hit.  Also, they tried to go for a nice moment with Elba and the daughter at the end but that felt shoehorned in, they just had the one scene together in the beginning, so the ending with them also didn’t feel totally earned.  The earlier scene with the daughter was kind of funny, but I didn’t envision from that she would tear up watching her dad on tv help stop a monster.  

Lastly, again with the final battle, they mention Superman is in this universe, so it begs the question, if there are other superheroes in this world… I think some would swoop in when there’s a giant alien starfish taking over a country and killing it’s citizens.  I have this gripe with other superhero movies too though.  I also am not sure I’m down with this squad pivoting after Waller said their mission is done then going full hero to take on the fish and save the world.

There are some nice switchups that are different enough from what you would expect that it keeps the movie fun.  The whole thing is just fun.  Some unexpectedness rises to the level of ‘Great’, but the general cleverness of sending in a b-squad or supers who are lemons or having Harley kill the main bad guy because she’s trying to be good are clever switch-ups that keep the movie fresh throughout.  This is a delicious meal after eating fast food for the last few years.  Very grateful for it.",oyxaam

Because Bloodsport could easily have been Deadshot in this movie, even down to the child being used against him.

The Suicide Squad - 8/10

The Suicide Squad is a totally ridiculous and hilarious wild ride that feels like a throwback to the action movies of the 90's. Heavily influenced by John Ostrander's comic run, it's a film about outcasts, misfits and weirdos and completely embraces is insanity. It's full of great characters, gory kills, a killer soundtrack, practical effects, set pieces bursting with creativity and a surprising amount of heart.

The characters are a blast and the writing is what really makes this such a fun watch. Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn is the best she's ever been, Cena's Peacemaker is hilarious, Idris Elba carries the film well and some of the lesser known characters end up unexpectedly becoming favourites. Also Sylvester Stallone as a talking shark...Yes!

It feels like this is the most ""James Gunn"" film that James Gunn has ever made. You can clearly see that the director has been let loose to unleash his creative vision for Task Force X. It feels a little like a counter to his Guardians of the Galaxy, where style, CGI and conforming to the MCU is swapped out for an R Rating, Gunn's off beat brand of humour, lots of blood and guts and it's grittier small scale feel. 

As for negatives, not all of the jokes landed for me and they massively changed Amanda Waller's character to be the butt of a joke which I wasn't a fan of at all. Some of the flashbacks and character exposition felt a bit messy and I also wish that we saw some more of certain characters. 

While it doesn't go as far as subverting the genre as a whole, it does enough to provide something fresh in a saturated industry struggling with superhero fatigue. Overall though, this is an absolute blast of a film and one of the best of the year without a doubt. And yes, it definitely deserves to be seen on the big screen!",oyxaam

h7wrtx4,"Few notes a thoughts I have (I’ve already shared them at r/DC_Cinematic, thought I’d shared them here as well):

1.	⁠I loved the movie. I watched the first one day before going to the screening of The Suicide Squad and it’s such a difference. James Gunn did a great job.

2.	⁠Although I love Elba and Bloodsport was great, his character Sid kinda seem like a ripoff of Deadshot.

3.	⁠Weasel totally reminded me of Sid from Ice Age, lol.

4.	⁠I wonder what do they have in store with Peacemaker’s characters for his show. At this point he’s clearly irredeemable, his actions were awful (he killed Flag for God’s sake!).  I hated his guts by the end, which I think was the point, we’re supposed to hate him and it’s also a huge credit to Cena’s performance. Honestly, can’t wait to see what they do with him in the upcoming show.

5.	⁠I love how the hyped and introduced bunch of new characters for this film and all-star cast playing them, only to kill half of them right at the beginning. Talk about subverting expectations.

6.	⁠Who else completely fell in love with Daniela Melchior’s Ratcatcher? She was definitely my favorite out of the bunch.

7.	⁠Go random woman (Flo) hitting Waller right before she was about to explode our protagonists! That moment was so satisfying.

8.	⁠Anyone else caught, that one of the rats playing Sebastian is called Crisp Ratt? I totally love that reference, made me giggle when I saw the name in the cast list.",oyxaam
h7ws3pw,honestly surprised they killed captain boomerang. unless the flash movie resets the timeline and gives him another chance :(,oyxaam
h7wse3r,Sebastian is easily the star of the whole film.   Has made me want a rat for the time in over 20 years.,oyxaam
h7wskxo,"This movie said fuck you to birds for some reason  

This movie ruled it was so much more bloody and violent then I thought possible

Had a fondness for Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn after the first Suicide Squad it's grown to admiration in birds of prey and in this movie my God the monologue with the president  and her escaping Chef kiss.",oyxaam
h7wtb4m,"It’s late but I want to write my thoughts down so hopefully this isn’t to incoherent:

I fucking loved this movie! It’s everything I wanted from the first Suicide Squad and comic book movies in general. It has a great balance between the humor, seriousness, gore, and comic book wackiness that I’ve been missing from Superhero films. It very much reminds me of DC’s Doom Patrol show.

You can tell James Gunn is a big fan of John Ostrander’s run (which created the modern concept of Suicide Squad) with the political messages and 70s war aesthetic. The fact people are surprised by how political it was should tell how piss poor of an adaptation the first film was. Also I’m beyond happy that someone like James Gunn sees the potential horror of Starro instead of just going “ha ha big evil starfish”, the lab scene was beyond creepy. Would’ve preferred Starro be in a Justice League film but this is probably the most respectful Starro will ever be treated in live action so I don’t mind that much. 

This movie actually managed to make me care about the main squad and it was sad when Flag & Polka-dot man didn’t make it. Ratcatcher (2) was an amazing character like I thought she would be and I totally called >!Taika playing her dad OG Ratcatcher!!< Another thing I always loved about Ostrander’s run was how it made these ridiculous villains feel like real characters that you don’t want to see die and this achieved in doing just that. The only flaw that I can think of is how obvious it is Bloodsport was originally meant to be Deadshot but I’m not sure Will Smith would’ve been nearly as charming as Elba is in this so maybe it was for the better. To add on to that Bloodsport’s armor and weaponry are 100% cooler than anything Deadshot did in the first film.

The last thing I want to mention is how the action scenes were seriously top notch. Off the top of my head I can’t think of any recent comic adaptation with fights that can compare to the revolutionary camp massacre, Harley’s escape, and Rick Flag vs Peacemaker.",oyxaam
h7wtdef,"**Heavy spoilers ahead warning**

Went into this really excited almost a little worried the early reviews were gassing it up a bit too much. But holy shit it was fucking spectacular!

The opening battle (although sorta par for the course for ensemble films like this) was so fucking brutal and the fact they didn’t peak right there is remarkable. >!Boomer’s fate surprised me (although I’m bias I think some people are a bit harsh on Jai Courtney)!< also Weasel not being able to swim had me dying laughing.

Especially liked their use of Waller. In the first film she’s so unimaginatively direct. The scene of her killing her team at the safe house (with Flag not giving a shit) never sat right with me mainly cause she faces no consequences. So going into this film where under her command (people who keep a death pool on the team members no less) are disturbed by how she’d use the legal system against Bloodsport’s daughter to get to him, to turn her back on the city only to get her just deserts was so fucking satisfying! This feels more like the Waller I’ve always known and it’s the sort of role I hoped Davis landed in the 2016 film.

And I’ll say that for the cast in general; they feel more well defined in keeping with their comic counterparts deviating where it counts. Flag actually has principles that he’s willing to die for, Peacekeeper is such a short sighted jingoistic prick he can’t see how insane his no quarter given mentality is, Bloodsport is a great unwilling leader and I especially liked Ratcatcher being the teams heart and the use of Shark & Polka Dot.

The film also taps into this feeling that the first one tried going for; the idea that just because they’re losers doesn’t make them irredeemable. In the first film they just sort of have a drink at a bar and just decide they’re family over a dudes story about how he burned his house down? Here they actually spill blood together and commit to actually doing the right thing. I fucking loved that.

Really I just fucking loved the movie and I might have to see it in theaters!

The song choice for the opening credits is fucking gold. 

I love how Flag's introduction to Sol Soria is similar to him introducing Katana. 


That Taika cameo felt a bit superficially stuffed in there. 


Pacing a bit iffy, it dwindles and meanders in the middle a fair bit. Towards the end it becomes less comical and much more dramatic, which I don't think is Gunn's strong suit. 

The campy violence is hella enjoyable and I'm surprised at how it jumps into Troma level gore near the end quite dramatically.

I love how Michael Rooker's character is built up to be some kind of badass but he gets overwhelmed by the beginning fight so much that he bails. Weasel ""dying"" right within the first 5 minutes is hilarious. 

Polka Dot man was a stand out character. His powers and the root of them hilarious. Sadly it didn't get used enough. 

It takes a special kind of man not just to portray a character like Peacemaker but also to write it. Gunn nails this perfectly.

Great watch for a fun weekend.

All the best DC!",oyxaam

h7wzrs6,"Peacemaker was great, John Cena did a great job and I absolutely loved the fight in the reflection and all the conflict between him and flag.

I like how Bloodsport, Flag and Peacemaker all kinda have the same skills they’re all shoots military men, but they feel distinct and have unique weapons not just relying on guns.

I do feel like the Harley and coup subplots were kinda unnecessary, they Harley one had some good moments but it felt like it was only there to give her the taste in men speech",oyxaam
h7x1rxt,"The movie has a few good emotional moments and all these scenes were given those few extra seconds at the end for it to breathe instead of cutting to the next topic quickly 

I truly hate it when MCU makes a joke at the end of an emotional/epic scene. In GotG 2, when the whole team makes a pose, the theme music is blasting, the camera turns and zooms out for this epic moment, and then a Fucking rock falls on batista. The whole moment is ruined. To top it all off, someone makes a dumb joke on this. 

I just never understood why they do this. In SS, there's similar kind of scene where Harley Quinn escapes herself and the team's plan were for nothing. But here it was actually funny, and more importantly this whole scene was build up for this exact joke. While in GotG 2, the humor is Fucking up an earned epic moment of a previous task. 

This is my favourite Gunn movie yet. I love GotG 1. But didn't like GotG 2. I had a lot of gripes with that movie. Hopefully he nails GotG 3.

Jai Courtney is a weird actor to me. I first saw him in Spartacus and thought he was great. Then saw him in die hard, terminator, and other stuff and thought he was the most boring actor alive. Then I saw Suicide Squad. An absolutely horrible piece of shit movie. I will outright say it is the worst studio movie I have ever seen (only movie I ever walked out on was Armageddon, only movie I regret not walking out on wax Suicide Squad). Despite the movie being so obnoxiously bad (and unlike Justice League, all footage was shot by a single director), Jai Courtney was awesome as Boomerang. It was like someone attached electrodes to his balls and said if he started to look bored he would be zapped. Very beginning of The Suicide Squad he seemed like he way enjoying the role and then splat. I would actually love to see a limited solo series set before the movies that gave him more to do",oyxaam

Like, Ratcatcher 2 and the Polka Dot Man were literally just victims of circumstance, and King Shark was just King Sharking. They were the kids. Bloodshot was Daddy. Also. Rick Flagg was Daddy. This movie had seen quality Daddy action. I love that Gunn's approach to morally dubious characters is so empathetic.

I didn't care much for either *Guardian of the Galaxy* films, but this was easily one of my favorite superhero films ever. The crafstmanship was out of this world!

There were scenes where I literally laughed out loud so hard that I was out of breath and the funnies kept piling up and escalating. I can't recall the last time I had this much fun at a movie theater!

Rating: 9/10 (most noticeably marred by some tedious pacing)",oyxaam

h7zl9h2,"Think the visuals of this movie nicely sun up its place in the macro superhero film world: basically the dull grays of many of the movies of the 2010s, splashed with color like Jackson Pollock with bloodlust. 

Feels like the logical end of an arc that started with  quippy earnestness in The Avengers, ballooned out to Deadpool/The Boys deconstruction, then found its way home to a weirder-than-we-could’ve imagined sweet spot middle ground. I liked it a whole bunch",oyxaam
h7zmphh,"Wow, this was surprisingly good!

Very humor and gore heavy, at times it felt like a more violent Naked Gun movie, with everybody being ""in"" on the jokes. While it reminded me of the Deadpool movies, it very much manages to do its own thing.

It already feels kinda finished after Peacemaker and Bloodsport have their stand-off, giving a conclusion to Flag getting killed, that hit hard.

But then there's a whole giant setpiece fight against Starro like some kind of encore. That was pretty decent, tho the Starro ""zombies"" just falling over from rat contact looked a bit too silly.

h812nti,"The Suicide Squad,of all people, would sympathize the most with Starro being a prisoner who is only used for nefarious purposes by militaries. It would've been a far bolder choice to have the Starro conflict resolve in the squad understanding his/her problems. Perhaps even using Starro as the bargaining chip against Waller.
They even set this up.with King Shark being a monster who is only looking for companionship,yhe movie could've ended with KS realizing that Starro was as lonely as him and the solution was friendship. Not to mention Ratcatcher's entire schtick being how she empathize with animals others consider threats and undesirables. Starro even communicates to her directly via the zombies how how he/she hopes that they have come to rescue her.

I know this is super cheesy but it fits the themes better and would be a subversion to the common explosions-and-debris 3rd act superhero movies have. Killing Starro is far more closer to what Waller would want eventually 
wanted. A far better and conflict is Waller ordering the team to kill Starro or capture him for the US,Starrobpleading not to be taken prisoner and the Squad freeing Starro or helping him/her escape,against Waller's wishes.

If I had any streaming services at home, I would definitely go back and watch the rest of the DC EU stuff because this is the first I’ve watched and I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. Plus, John Cena! 🤩

Though at the end, when I saw the composition of the wide-shot of Polka Dot Man celebrating after damaging Starro, I knew he was gonna die, classic giant monster trope.

On the negative side, Peter Capaldi totally phoned it in, and it would have been interesting to see >!the fashy elements of Peacemaker explored a bit more like with Homelander in *The Boys*.!< But I don't think John Cena has the acting chops for that and it wasn't what they were going for anyway.

Q1) I've seen about 4 - 6 comments here saying that Thinker abused Starro. Where in the movie was this illustrated or stated?
(The audio is a little unclear, and where I'm from, subtitles are in Mandarin, so if a character's voice was muffled, I pray that I somehow can read the Mandarin subtitles)


Q2) Re: when Bloodsport shot Peacemaker, it showed a zoomed in illustration of how Bloodsport's bullet went through, I don't understand what I'm supposed to make out of it? Small bullets are better?


Q3) At the scene where Thinker is showing that apart from locals he used ""Journalists, Political rivals."" Apart from their faces also stucked with a mini Starro, why are their bodies torn apart bleeding? They look semi alive


Q4) How did Thinker keep(housed) Starro? I legitimately thought there was lava / in a volcano action going on.


Q5) When Nanaue/King Shark was enchanted by the aquarium with its ""New Dumb friends"", why were they also following him around as Nananue/King Shark jumped around?


Q6) So sad about Flag's death, why didn't he shoot Peacemaker? Or realistically, fake it. Pretend that he did not want to share the clip. Say smth like ""You're right, for peace, I shan't share this clip."" OR JUST KEEP THE MOTIVES TO YOURSELF. LESS IS MORE.",oyxaam

hg1sg3e,"Such a fun movie. In almost every scene you could just feel James Gunn having fun flexing his creative muscles. Weirldy enough, I found myself comparing this film to Army of the Dead with how similar some of the plot points are. I thought it was fascinating to see how differently Snyder and Gunn prioritised visual style, storytelling and characterization in their respective films. Snyder clearly prioritized visual style so much to the point where he neglected the other two in a sloppy fashion. Gunn on the other hand had a much better balance between the three. They were much more coherent with each other and the whole was greater than the sum of it's parts. Which made for an overall well rounded film.",oyxaam

h7z922u,"Ummm...it was kinda boring..? The first 10 minutes was the most entertaining for me. I don’t know why, but I just feel this movie was overly long and checked my watch several times. Maybe the pacing? I had been so hyped to see this movie until I saw it, and I’m not gonna lie, I was very disappointed.

To be fair, this movie was miles better than predecessor in acting, cinematography, writing, editing etc. I like some characters like Blood sport and Ratcatcher2(and Sebastian!)

I was really excited for King Shark and PolkaDotMan, and their characters turned out so-so. I think these characters could have been so much better. A few of King Shark’s scenes  were indeed funny, but the others were not so much. If King Shark was a comic relief in this movie, then I don’t think this movie utilized King Shark that good. As for PolkaDotMan, his backstory and power were good. I just think his death should have been a little bit later. Him realizing he finally became what he really wanted to deserved more screen time. I wish there was a scene where he sacrificed himself for everyone as a “superhero”, not the scene where he realized he was a superhero and immediately got crushed by Starro like in the movie.

Anyway I think this movie was not bad, but mediocre. 6/10 I want a friend like Sebastian.",oyxaam

h81texw,"Was it just me in the middle of the movie that started to wonder what they were actually doing with Harley Quinn? When the scene began where she was going to this ""president"". Later this whole sequence, suddenly she slept with him, then he proposes to her. I started to wonder ""why is she doing this? It's stupid it doesn't make sense at all."" And after she kills him, she suddenly comes back to being what she was. WTF? Have I fallen asleep and missed any scenes?
No idea what they planned to do with her.",oyxaam
h845ysk,Personally I was disappointed. It was a lot of cliche scenes and jokes. Overall okay story but it was slow. There were a few good laughs but far from something like guardians of the galaxy or Deadpool,oyxaam
h84amw0,"Horrible movie. I don't get this kind of humor so it's probably my fault.

But yes, better than the first one.",oyxaam
h86cjav,"Something about James Gunn's aesthetic here kinda creeps me out. Maybe having a studio reign in his violent fantasies is for the best, as Guardians didn't have the same issue, but the way in which the violence is hyper-stylized and almost fetishized in this movie began to really wear on me and gross me out. I know he has a lot of fans of his older work who recognize him for that Troma approach and movies like Slither have a following, but it just felt gratuitous here in a really nasty and mean-spirited way. 

I'm not a prude whatsoever, I grew up on violent action movies, but the way in which this film kind of leers over heads being blown up and organs being torn apart just creeps me out. And because it's so often happening to the ostensible (anti) heroes, it also makes it a little gross just how fascinated the film is with watching them suffer in ghastly ways. 

For example, when - spoiler warning- Rick Flagg dies, did we really need that close-up shot of his heart being pierced internally? Did Gunn think we wouldn't get the severity of his injury without it? Or was it more like he was just enamored at the idea of being able to show an organ being punctured? I don't have an issue with violence in general, but it's that kind of borderline sexual fetishization of the ultra-violence that didn't sit well with me, I think. 

Ultimately the movie left me cold and feeling pretty dirty after a while, and I realize I'll probably get down voted to hell and lectured on how the previous Suicide Squad was too watered down (agreed) and this was a decisive response to that movie's tone, or I'll get an explanation of why this violence is a faithful representation of the comics...but after a while the gleeful delight with which it is portrayed just wore thin on me.

Also, I thought the story kind of ground to a halt midway and the Starfish stuff just got too self-consciously silly in an obnoxious way. I loved the opening and was entertained up through the point where Harley Quinn bangs the drug lord guy. At that point I felt like they began drawing out the story but didn't really have anywhere substantial to go with it.",oyxaam
h8790n8,"Seem to be going against the grain here, but I think this movie is way overrated. 

The humor was terribly forced and juvenile (not in a clever way). 

Thought it was surprisingly pretty tame in the gore department as well. 

Also the structure of the film was bizarre and I didn’t think that it flowed well at all. Was fairly bored throughout most of it. 

The beginning was the best part. Went downhill from there.",oyxaam
h8l0bk6,"The humor went down like a lead balloon in the cinema I was in. Does anyone find this humor funny? It's just loud and shouty while being meta, very Deadpool.

h7w6j9d,"I really enjoyed the movie, it did so many things right and was miles ahead of the original. That being said, the over-the-top but realistically rendered constant in your face gore combined with the comedic tone really threw me off. A lot of people in the comments here said they found TDK's death hilarious, but the shot of him rolling around as his arms get swiss cheesed was fucking brutal. The goddamn rats burying themselves in the eye, chewing threw it is going to haunt my dreams. The shark guy chewing on that guy's face like an apple, all of this was too much. The gore stopped being funny after Pete Davidson died, and just left me feeling skwemish. What exactly is funny about a woman burning alive in a fire???",oyxaam
h853ati,"I recognize that I'm likely going to be in the minority here, but I'm feeling brave enough to voice my opinion; I very much disliked this film (except for Harley's story/scenes, which I did enjoy). 

And I say this as an avid lover and consumer of film, comics, and 'Suicide Squad' specific media. I've read and watched nearly every officially published Suicide Squad story, and this is by far my least favorite.

I actually strongly prefer the first Suicide Squad movie, and feel that if DC had given David Ayer the same creative control and freedom as James Gunn, and hadn't interfered with the editing of the film so heavily, that the first film could have been a truly spectacular Suicide Squad story. 

But this film (in my opinion) pretty much spat in the face of anyone invested in the source material, or that actually enjoyed the first film despite its obvious flaws.

Anyways, anyone still reading should go watch ""Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay"", which is (again, just in my opinion here) objectively the best crafted Suicide Squad film to date.

R.I.P. Captain Boomerang. Gunn did you dirty, mate. Boomie is legitimately one of the only Suicidie Squad members, nevermind team regulars, who has survived every single squad mission he's gone on (except one story where he is killed by General Zod, to my knowledge) and has actually successfully commuted his prison sentence and been set free (only to get arrested again later, but still an impressive accomplishment).",oyxaam
h8812lv,"You could edit Harley out of this film without changing the plot, only tweaking the justification for certain events, like generals just decided to betray the bachelor on their own, the javelin just laying next to a random dead soldier and Bloodshot being the one to throw it.  I only noticed because I hate this version of the character and I wish they had left her out.  

Speaking of, her escape sequence reeks of Joss Whedon.  It could have been lifted from...anything he's written.  Especially the bit where she uses her feet to get the key and unlock it.  Not that this is something the character wouldn't do - how else are you going to grab the key from a body on the floor and unlock the chains while dangling by your wrists after all - just that it's very much in Whedon's wheelhouse.

Still enjoyed the movie overall.  I want to say Ratchatcher was the standout, but even then she was kinda bland.  We know more about Peacemaker's ethics than hers, but that was only so the audience would hate him.",oyxaam
h7w6fmx,"Really disappointed, ngl.  Way too much focus on the rebellion storyline in the first half, and I know it's the whole point of the bait and switch but they really wasted some of the more interesting characters in the beginning.   Also I've come to realize I really don't find James Gunn's style of humor funny, at all; every joke that John Cena said was like, Drax potato chip levels of unfunny.",oyxaam

h83bhzo,"Really not understanding why everybody here thinks this movie was so fantastic.  It was...fine.  But honestly it feels just as empty as the Suicide Squad from a few years back that everyone here hates.  It didn't help that almost every single actually funny joke in the movie was already spoiled in the trailers.  There were hardly any remaining humorous writing that I hadn't seen already.

The characters were extremely hollow and honestly feel just like the characters everybody hated in the first one.  Bloodsport is shown as a person who just doesn't care about anything and is extremely against joining the squad, then what feels like 90 seconds later, is walking around meeting his new team without any hesitation or pushback.

The story was super fucking hollow as well.  They're tasked with going into a town and destroying a building and any data in it.  Well, OK.  Then you find out it's because they want to destroy incriminating evidence.  Well, OK.  That's it.  Then there's the huge starfish that apparently couldn't stomp it's way out of there already but a few small explosives did the trick.  Well, OK.

Shark was very underused, he seems very powerful but just didn't do much at all.

The whole story was very basic and not very interesting at all and the final fight should of been between John Cena and bloodshot as I felt they had this on going beef the whole film (it's very stupid he somehow survived, the building was literally destroyed).

The comedy did hit sometimes but 90% of the time was overused jokes and just child like humour really wasn't for me.

Action was great can't say anything wrong with that.

I'd give it a 5/10 was a average film great action but story wasn't good. Think superhero films are always overrated I understand the last one was bad but that doesn't make the new one good because it's better. No way it's a 8/10 or more I wouldn't rank this close to great films like guardians of the Galaxy and most of the new avengers films.",oyxaam

Wow, no doubt in my mind James Gunn can make really good funny comic book movies. It was a great fucking film. Marvel and DC should really make more R18 movies. Pete Davidson as Blackguard and Flula as Javelin was really something that I enjoyed, even though they had short screentime. Was surprised by TDK's hilarious ability, and Mongal just being Mongal.

Taika Waititi being Ratcatcher 1 was so cute, and her successor Ratcatcher was the heart of the movie. She was so lovable and was the saviour of the squad. Her genuine trust with King Shark and her morning stubbornness was really funny. Easily my favorite character in the film, next to Polka Dot Man, which I was shocked that James Gunn killed his character. I really thought he could survive the fight. 

Harleen Quinzel's solo prison escape was dope as fuck. James Gunn revitalized her character. I always thought she was a weak character and not really a threat because of my exposure to the Arkham games and fhe animated series. But she really was a freaking badass and a joy with all her scenes. Margot owns that role, I think she's on par with Heath as Joker and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine as being the face of the character and not really thinking someone can do what they did with their characters. 

Bloodsport was very good, I hope Will Smith never comes back. Idris Elba is so much more better than Will. And thank god someone finally got the nerve to smack Amanda Waller.

h7x17vt,"The movie was fantastic! It's bloody, gory and funny!

- James Gunn's direction in this movie is top-notch! Probably his best movie in terms of directing! A few of greatly directed scenes were the Harley breakout scene, the Peackmaker-Rick Flagg fight reflected on the helmet, Bloodsport dropping down the levels of the building to meet Peacemaker for duel! When Bloodsport saw Ratcatcher-2 on the floor with Cena standing above her with a gun. No words or explanation was necessary as he knew what was going on! 
- The cold open was perfect! Opening with Michael Rooker's Savant, showcasing him as a smart and deadly person then showing a softer side when he rescued Weasel only for him to chicken out and get his head blown off! 
- The secondary squad got annihilated! Javelin didn't even throw his javelin! Bummed that Boomerang got killed. I kinda liked that he and Harley were good friends!
- Not all jokes landed but some were really funny! I kinda lost it when Weasel drowned and when it was revealed that Peacemaker & Bloodsport killed the rebel soldiers! 
- The primary suicide Squad was great! Elba is an addition to the squad and I hope to see him and Deadshot in the next mission, exchanging tips on how to better fathers. Favourite weapon: The crossbow-lite weapon where he shoots arrows from his arm.
- Harley Quinn's subplot slowed things down in the 2nd act but it gives progression for her character over the movies she was in and Margot Robbie is always great!
- Ratcatcher-2 and Polka Dot Man with the main emotional arcs of the movie! Daniela Melchior and David Dastmalchian gave the two best performances of the movie too! 
- Peacemaker is honestly my favourite character from this movie! His douchey Captain America was great and he was the only one of the squad to not get a greater backstory or arc. Also, John Cena sold the scene he killed Rick Flagg. His reaction when he had to kill someone he respected for the mission, compounded with Flagg's last line. I'm even more interested in the spin-off! 
- Amanda Waller getting knocked out! That was satisfying, ngl!
- Starro's last line was haunting!

I would this in the top 3 of DCEU movies! With the Peacemaker TV series and reports of a sequel and more spin-offs, I'm excited for more Gunn-DC projects! DC as a whole are moving in the right direction and I can't wait for the next movie - The Batman!",oyxaam

I know that’s what a lot of people are excited over but I was missing tie ins to the rest of the universe even if it’s a stand alone movie. John Cena did well but it’s one buff guy too many, the jokes felt very forced at times, why added animated colors for Harley but no huge animated glowing vomit scene for PDM?

Polka Dot guy and Rat Girl weren't good. John Cena is John Cena and it's hard to see him as anything else. There's lots of good ingredients. DC has traditionally been known as fucking miserable, and they tried to lighten up the first SS in post which was disastrous. They bring over Gunn to do what he did with GotG, and it works. This movie is competent. The story makes sense. It has many jokes that are legitimately funny, and I knew they were funny, I said to my self ""that's funny,"" but I didn't laugh. Nobody in the theatre laughed, and I've learned that when something funny happens and it falls completely flat there's an issue with tone. The tone is a mish-mash throughout. Sometimes it's supposed to be very intense, sometimes very violent, and sometimes it's a screwball comedy... it jerks you around a little too much for an audience to completely connect with a scene. The premise of the movie is good, but it is hurt by the existence of the first one. The third act is probably the most cohesive, and that is usually the most important thing for a movie to do. Overall, I'd say the movie was fine. Lots of good ingredients, that didn't completely come together. It's competent, but not remarkable, but for DC, competent is a high bar.",oyxaam

I think if you tend more towards the Marvel PG-13 type superhero films, you won't care for this but if you appreciate realistic violence (granted sometimes over the top) and warped humor, then this is a must see.

h8cl59t,"I loved it. One of my favorite superhero movies ever. I understand that some of you dont/wont like it, but I also have a feeling (like what happens with almost every DC movie) that some of you just really love Marvel movies and anything that isnt that is gonna get shit on.  People have a weird attachment to Marvel and so often they can put out a pretty lackluster movie and people praise it like. Everyone has different opinions, but when people shit on a movie like this, and then say things like ""Theres really only like 3-4 bad Marvel movies"" (which is absurd, theres like 23 or so total, and Id say at least half are only ""alright""",oyxaam
h8hnazx,"Holy crap, this just kept getting better and better. I was feeling like a wet turd with all the Messi fuss, so I decided to give this a try instead of staying at home brooding, and I'm so glad I did.

Easily the best DCEU film to date, 10/10. I **loved** Ratcatcher 2, the entire movie as a whole was full of heart, with good humor and terrific action scenes. Also, I was kinda sad with Polka Dot Man and Flagg's death, and I had never been invested in these characters before. Just awesome, man.

h858793," Surprised by all the positive reception. Thought this was just okay. John Cena did well and had charisma, but like 75% of the banter jokes didn’t land for me and I thought the plot was really silly (even given the idea of a suicide squad). Framing of each shot made everything very predictable. 

I though the movie felt like 12 independent sequences kind of roughly stitched together to make a somewhat coherent movie. Character arcs and themes were pretty much thrown out the window or pulled out of thin air in the end. Like Taika Watiti’s message about purpose, and Bloodsports daughter. 

Felt like the script needed another couple run throughout and I think Gunn, while handling ensemble casts well needed someone close to him to tell him no. Felt like his attempted weird, over stylized fluff got in the way more than it added. 

Climax was also not as fun as I was hoping with a giant space starfish. 

Idk to me this felt kind of lame.",oyxaam

h7wg867,"Why is the Snyder cult mad at this movie again? It doesn’t replace the old movie in canon (if there even is a fucking canon anymore). The first movie still very much happened, it’s just not really referenced because the vibe is that was just another mission for them",oyxaam
h7yb7id,"Are people not getting the political message? I thought it was obvious Gunn even has  John Cena play a government lacky covering up America's dirty secret. The finale is literally called dirty secret. 

The Final plot point is flagg wanting to expose the world to America's Experiments. The very thing he died for. Not a fan o f the movie but those scenes were pretty powerful and had a clear message. ""Peacemaker"" is an Ironic joke towards America.",oyxaam
h7yl6ql,"I thought the movie was good, though I don't understand the acclaimed hype. Maybe because Suicide Squad was 
so bad that a competent film enhances the film. The first 2/3rds of the movie reminded me of your typical
rag tag group on a suicide mission much like Army of the Dead. Nothing was special about the movie until
Peacemaker's betrayal and the reveal of Starro the Conqueror. 

I do wish the Suicide Squad Alpha had more scenes and lasted longer, I know they weren't going to survive
but they should've had a purpose outside of just dying. (Savant, Javelin, Blackguard, Mongal didn't even
show their super powers.) 

The Corto Maltese government could've hired hitmen like KGBeast, Electricutioner, Firebug, Mad Dog and Thinker.
They could've fought Suicide Squad Alpha and they all could've just canceled each other out 
with the Thinker, Flagg and Quinn being the survivors. 

The movie had great visuals pertaining to Harley, her Lance of Longinus cutting the soldiers with the flower
petal imagery and her diving into the eye of Starro. She's not obnoxious in this film and she was actually great.

I wished Polka Dot Man had a better death than getting stomped on. Harley could've opened Starro's eye with the 
lance and Polka Dot Man could've just excruitated himself inside, exploding Starro and himself within. (would've been a great foreshadowing and basically justifying the Suicide in Suicide Squad)

Anyways this movie is miles better than the original Suicide Squad and the humor actually works but does nothing outright amazing or ground 
breaking in terms of Superhero films, this one was pretty safe.

6.5/10",oyxaam

Honestly?! What a fucking joyous ride!

I genuinely cried thanks to Ratcatcher 2 

Idris Elba is legendary

Best Harley Quinn on screen ever. The character was finally NAILED and Robbie looked like she was LIVING the entire time.

- A lot of the humor just didn’t work. Honestly when I recommend this I’m not even gonna mention the comedy. That mom joke just didn’t work at all. It’s weird because I’m a fan of James Gunn’s humor.
- I wish the first squad got at least one more scene together before they died. Maybe the beach assault could’ve been longer or something. I don’t mind they all died but they all got as much development as slipknot. Pete Davidson, Nathan fillion, and Jai Courtney could’ve added some great humor early on. Deadpool 2 did a similar rug pull much better.
-Polkadot man’s death was lame. For such a visual movie it felt like Gunn was rushing to the end by just crushing him.

-This one is a very personal gripe but Ratcatcher 2 should’ve died. It would’ve made sense for her arc to sacrifice herself and we needed an actually surprising death.

There were definitely cool and funny moments, but it didn't really feel cohesive as a movie itself. It was definitely better than 2016 version but below Gunn's other work like Guardians of the Galaxy.

Some observations:

- Bloodsport has his helmet on quite a lot during this movie. I wonder if they did that because Idris wasn't on set as much as other actors so this was there way of getting around that.

- when the squad pulls up to the Jötunheim tower, it starts raining but also suddenly it's also blinding light out too. Unless I missed some piece of information, this happens for no reason other than it looks cool.

- Rick Flagg was unnecessary and should've died on the beach. They set up a nice little rivalry with Bloodsport and Peacemaker but then Flagg comes in and kind of gets in the way of that dynamic.

- The whole Amanda Waller finale was a little weird. First she tells the squad not to engage with Starro cause it ain't their problem (huh?) then she takes a golf club to the head by one of her staff, who then goes bat shit crazy barking out orders. It clearly looks like Waller is dead but then she's fine later and her staff is still there like it was all just a misunderstanding.",oyxaam
h7ygsza,"Many shots in the movie was beautiful, Flowers during Harley shooting, King Shark tearing a guy, Star fish flying in slow motion and inside Starro's eye..  Slow motion shots were really used well, unlike Synder Cut..",oyxaam
h7yhytd,"Considering the “don’t get attached to no one” huge aspect of this movie, it was quite painful to watch the absurd amount of plot armor Bloodsport and Harley had compared to pretty much everybody else.

It's the most fun summer Blockbuster so far this year(fuck it, I like it more than Pig and Green Knight) and I think that's owed a lot to James Gunn's flippant, stylish direction. That and I love his use of colors, embracing comic books entirely.

The chemistry between the actors is great. Then you have the characters all have very distinct personalities, which make them all very likeable. I'm just happy to see Idris Elba as a lead in a comic book movie that's actually really good. You think Bloodsport would be a boring guy, but Elba plays him as this guy who's like ""not this shit"" again in a squad of loopy characters work well. Even Rick Flag work as a straight man probably because he cared about his squad members and wanted to do some good with the hard drive. I probably could go on and on about how I love each character.

The beach scene was important because it showed how Gunn wasn't afraid to kill off characters. It certainly upped the tension that support characters could die at any time. 

Action scenes.... thank you, James Gunn. You can actually see the damn action clearly. None of that shaky cam, rapid cut shit like Black Widow or Snake Eyes. You can appreciate the choreography in its entirely whether it's the gun fights or the hand to hand combat sequence.",oyxaam
h808hj4,"I only like maybe 2 or 3 superhero movies, but this is my #1 favorite. Gave it a shot and streamed it and was so entertained. Thought it was so creative and played with comic book tropes in a funnier and more satisfying way than like Deadpool, which i thought was meh.  This suicide squad was amazing though i loved it. i was absolutely cackling when the crew is coming to the realization that they just slaughtered resistance fighter good guys thinking they were rescuing Flagg. They really didn't hold back with these protagonists being BAD guys, they killed those people it is what it is. And the story and charm still works somehow.

i do motion graphics for job occasionally and LOVED the scene titles or kinda chapter cards they did throughout where they used the scenery to spell things out.  Idris Elba is hit or miss to me, but he absolutely killed it in this, i thought every actor brought it and it showed on screen. want to watch again. legitimately teared up when Ratcatcher 2 saves the day and flashes back to a memory with her dad, and also again when Idris pets the rat and isn't as afraid.",oyxaam

And damnnnn John Cena is jacked. And kinda knew that they wouldn't kill him off. (So are they forming checkmate?)

 
The shot when Idris Elba and John Cena fought while the camera was on Peacemaker's helmet was brilliant

 
Wasn't expecting Starro to be killed by rats and Harley piercing its eye- it took the entire Justice League to bring it down, but nonetheless, it was better than the first movie

 John Cena did a excellent job as Peacemaker.  Reading through the comments I had no clue he was the inspiration for the Comedian but it's easy to tell it.

So many of the jokes fell flat (e.g 'millenials') and it may well be that I went in with the wrong mindset and I should rewatch it, but I thought it wouldn't take itself as seriously as it did. I really didn't care about any of the characters other than Nananue and Polka dot man, so the emotional scenes really didn't get me, and to be honest I'm still not sure if some of the scenes are meant to be emotional or not. For example the scene on the bus when Bloodsport and Ratcatcher are talking about their backstories, I thought that scene was supposed to be comedic, like so over the top dramatic it's funny, with Bloodsport saying that he hates rats because his 'old man' locked him in a box with them when he was a kid. The character seemed like such a cliche I thought it was a deliberate joke, but no one in my cinema was laughing. However of course I may be wrong and it actually was supposed to be comedic. It's the same with Ratcatcher and Taika Waititi playing her dad, surely that was like a joke/comedic casting. But then there's that whole bit at the end where he talks about how rats are the lowest creatures but they have purpose. It just didn't 'get' me in the way I could tell the movie wanted to. 
Harley Quinn as well, to be honest I don't find her likeable and just find her annoying most of the time, but thats just me and I'm not trying to criticise Margot Robbie's performance, I get that people do like it, but it's just not for me. But that scene when she married the guy went on for ages and was pretty out of place, right? And it ended with what felt like to me another unearned emotional scene. I haven't seen Birds of Prey so of course there's context I'm probably missing, but to be fair the movie should stand alone (which it definitely does). 
It's not to say I think this is a bad movie, the action was really great and there were jokes that landed and were funny, but my overall feeling was disappointment. I know they are different movies and shouldn't compare them really, but it's hard not to compare this to Guardian's of the Galaxy 1+2. Seeing as they are both superhero action/comedies with an ensemble cast directed by James Gunn. Both up really great movies (2 inparticular), but Suicide Squad honestly feels more similar to Guardians 1 than I thought it would. I'm trying to articulate this point without sounding like a wank who just didn't get what he wanted, but I do think that from the trailers I thought the movie would take itself way less seriously than it did. 
I know this sounds really stupid, but in many ways I expected the movie to be more different from other superhero movies than it was. Of course there's the great action, costumes, soundtrack, and a really cool fun villain (really sounds like I'm talking myself out of my own point) but surely I can't be the only one that felt a lot of what was underneath the surface was pretty generic. I saw a lot of it coming by the end, like when the daughter goes ""that's my dad"", it's not like a bad scene or anything, but it's just a bit like 'come on'. I'm aware that last point sounds very petty, but I hope you guys get what I mean by it. I could guess a lot of the lines before they were said, and was disappointed when I was right.
But once again I might just need to rewatch it, I still liked the movie. The opening 15 minutes were really great.

h8g1ee4,"James Gunn reboots his recently twitter-cancelled career with a reboot of the recent flop Suicide Squad, in which Warner Bros. executives realize they should leave their directors with a singular vision to actually execute that vision. The result is a movie that is incomparably better than the first part and one that will either entertain the hell out of its viewers or confirm their suspicions of having late-stage superhero fatigue. There are many good jokes, fun violent action scenes, well written banter between actual characters, and even some successful subversion of expectation. But then the movie just keeps on going. It has no business being over two hours long (or even over 90 minutes long) and it overstayed its welcome way past the point when its novelty wore off and its wackiness became repetitive and stale. While the first thirty minutes are laugh-out-loud funny, the final half hour is just loud. The film also somehow manages to look both expensive and cheap at the same time and be simultaneously clever and stupid.",oyxaam

Peacemaker casually killing the sleeping dude was the funniest bit.  Polkadot man visions of his mother near the end was funny too.  Margot Robbie is great as usual.  Viola Davis was excellent as Walker yet again and the action was better delivered than the first film.  

But what really lets this film down is the humor and how the jokes were delivered.  I think I only laughed a couple of times and the rest of the movie I just cringed.  It all felt really forced to me, and I said the exact same thing when I seen the trailer a while back.  Joel Kinnaman in particular felt really wooden trying to be funny.

h7wewcw,"Much better than the original Suicide Squad. 

The Good:
Beautiful cinematography, great soundtrack, awesome fight scenes, Idris Elbra, 2nd half of Harley Quinn. Including that awesome scene where she breaks out.

The Bad:
CGI on King Shark and Starro was bad (maybe a stylistic choice). Typical “let’s break a serious moment with some slapstick” from Gunn. Whole first half of the movie felt very disjointed. Too much fan service with random shots or scenes that took me out of the movie. Just kept bouncing around and didn’t feel like one movie, rather a series of individual scenes. Not a fan of the Starro at the end.

Basically the first half was mediocre. The next 40% was phenomenal (basically once Harley breaks out until the Starro breaks out outside). Last 10% was pretty meh.

Overall, 6/10. Entertaining and like where they took it. Would definitely watch a sequel.",oyxaam
h7zyqxi,"I didn't even make it halfway through the movie before I had fully realized James Gunn actually managed to make a better movie than anything the DCEU has put out thus far, with a fucking sequel (obviously more of a reboot, but still technically a sequel) to the Suicide Squad of all movies. Despite Gunn's involvement, I was still very cautiously optimistic about this movie given the recent string of HBO Max movie releases, not to mention the DCEU movies in general. But I'm very glad to have had my doubts proven wrong because this movie was a great time from start to finish. It just goes to show how even the wildest story premises can work if you give your script just the right amount of heart and humor.",oyxaam
h80rq9p,"Better than the first one, but holy hell does it need more editing. It drags on for soooo long easily 30mins could've been shaved off in pointless exposition. The pacing is constantly stop and go. I wanted so badly to love this, but overall was pretty meh. Characters had good individual moments, but not enough that I could watch this a 2nd time.",oyxaam
h82uveo,"It's definitely an improvement over the 2016 version in every possible way - direction, action, characters, comedy overall. Gunn was the perfect man to do the job and he delivered... mostly. 

The casting was perfect - John Cena was an absolute superstar, Idris was awesome and Daniela Melchior has a bright future ahead of her. The humor was just subpar - the Milton bit has me rolling to this moment [I'm chuckling to myself as I write about him, seriously such a perfect joke!]. Their characters were just perfect but King Shark just as I expected just stole my heart. 
 
I can't stop feeling a little underwhelmed after watching it though. I know that it's against the overall ""flow"""" but I can't help it. 

1. The best parts were spoiled with the trailers - I know that technically this shouldn't be an issue but yet it is. The essence of James Gunn, the comedy that is so ""his"" was in those 2-3 trailers and the rest that tied those scenes together was... acceptable. Of course act 3 with Starro that was obviously hidden in secrecy delivered tenfold, but that was only like what... 40 minutes of the movie? 

2. The beginning - I know that Gunn said we were supposed to not get attached to characters and sacrificing Team 1 as a diversion because of Blackguard's betrayal, but... the tone of it was sooooo off, it was jarring. It really feels like this particular scene was written and directed for the sake of showing the audience ""OMG look how quirky we are!"" and (for me) it was just offputting. Having everyone be involved and slowly picking them off one by one would've been way better. 

3. So. Much. Unnecessary. Bullshit! - Harley Quinn's riddiculous side story, all the time jumps, Peacemaker's clever but also useless double twist, all the ""history"" of new characters... like come on! - I don't know, maybe I'm being riddiculous and nitpicky with this one but this movie had so many layers that were intersecting and overlapping with eachother that there were moments where it made me think just simply ""why"". Why can't a suicide squad movie just focus on a bunch of bad people forced to do their job and be assholes to one another. I don't know, maybe just my own taste is different.

Overall... a weak 7/10. I had fun, I had a couple of laughs, definitely enjoyed how the movie was directed. But it's still not it for me. I hope Gunn gets to come back for a potential sequel because he definitely needs to make another one.",oyxaam
h83uf0k,"This is easily the most competent film to come out of the DC Universe since the Nolan trilogy. Each film following that trilogy has had redeeming qualities, but full of flaws that are hard to overlook. This is the FIRST one that I felt was close to perfect. Well acted, written, shot, paced, etc. The effects were quite good, and I somehow felt invested in these B and C tier characters. 

I hope WB realizes that this is the level of quality we want for ALL future films. Well fucking done James Gunn.

I don't know... maybe I'll find flaws once that sheen wears off, but I'm feeling those 9/10 reviews are pretty warranted right now.",oyxaam

I haven't seen many superhero movies, but Infinity War was exactly the same, just without gore. Here's a tense tear jerking scene of Thanos killing Gamora or whatever and here's a fart joke with a le funny one liner immediately after.

Like, it's weird. I enjoyed GotG. They aren't masterpieces, but they're both fun romps. And reading other reviews here, it seems like most others liked this movie. But it just didn't do much for me. I actually had forgotten several of the characters were even in the team by the end they left such a small impact on me.

I liked the *ideas* behind a lot of it. A bunch of ""heroes"" who are really more victims of abuse being forced to fight a ""villain"" who also is itself more of a victim of abuse has the potential to be very tragic and really something special. It just didn't do anything for me. I'd need to really rewatch the movie to place exactly why, but I don't really want to, as, well, I found it kinda boring. Not awful, just... unmemorable.

Happy to those who enjoyed it. Not for me, sadly.

This is a complete side note, but I don't really like how DC handles Harley Quinn. I won't hold this against the movie or anything, as the movie has internal consistency with it, but I feel that Harley and the Joker shouldn't ever be, well... strong. They should lose every fight they're in. The reason they're dangerous is that they're willing to do whatever it takes, and can never be talked down. But they aren't fighters, really.

But it feels like DC wants to make Harley into a one-woman army. They do it in their animated movies, and live action, and I just don't agree with this direction. Her killing the fiance? *Perfect* Harley Quinn. Her killing an entire army without a scratch? That's Deathstroke's thing.",oyxaam

Just a disappointing, overly-indulgent, and awful movie, yet still better than the first Suicide Squad.

The thing I like the best is the whole story arch, so the whole movie basically

It was funny, had great casting, the costume and makeup department did a fantastic job. FX was 8/10 but you gotta save money somewhere 

It was a bit leading with the expose in the first 30 min, but what do you expect from Hollywood. But some things, like John Cena wearing shirts that were far to small, was a perfect foreshadowing to his douschbagery as a character 

To top it all off, it was surprisingly Wholesome and I like that that  controller cunt got hit in the head",oyxaam
h7zk09u,"I thought the movie was great but I had my issues.

**Pros:**

1) Movie was way better than the first one, not even close.

2) It lived up to the name of Suicide Squad. By the end only 4 people lived. The people who were killed off were surprising.

3) Great humor and different enough from GOTG. I was worried it'd be too similar to the former.

4) Action and characters were great. Imo John Cena/Peace Maker stole the show. I thought his character was going to be trash and didn't understand his ideology in the beginning. I look forward to his show. Daniela Melchior was a gem, I expect her to have a lot of offers after this movie. Hopefully she's a permanent member of this franchise going forward.

**Cons:**

1) Bloodsport, Flagg, Capt. Boomerang, Thinker, and Harley. First off, I didn't like that Capt. and Flagg were killed off. I feel like they should've been part of the untouchable core. I can get over Capt. dying but Flagg being killed off doesn't sit well with me. I'm hoping he'll come back but I'm sure showing his heart being stabbed was Gunn's way of saying that he's dead.

I honestly felt like Bloodsport didn't do enough to differentiate himself from Flagg, Peace Maker, or Deadshot. I liked the character but he didn't endear himself to me. It was obvious that he was a stand-in for Deadshot. I feel like they should've killed him off in the end. His weapons were cool though.

Thinker shouldn't have been in the movie at all. He was portrayed as just some weird scientist. Don't know why they bothered to have him if he was just going to be a regular guy.

Harley felt forced, like WB told Gunn that she had to be in the movie. While Robbie was great I felt like Harley didn't add anything to the movie. You could take her out of the movie and it wouldn't change much outside of her killing the president or stabbing Staro.

2) The B plot, the resistance army B plot was unnecessary filler. Could've done without it. At least we got that cool sequence where the team kills them. Alice Braga's character should've had Harley's plotline.

3) TDK and Polka-dot man's power. This is probably me nitpicking with TDK but I feel like his powers should've at least been a bit more serious. Nonetheless it was a funny moment. As for Polka-Dot Man I feel like his powers should've functioned like his comic book counterpart. Each colored polka-dot having its own ability rather than just melting everything. I'm sure Gunn could've found someone with melting powers. Although I understand why the character was in the movie and I can respect that.

4) The movie starts off great and begins to decline as it goes along. At the beginning I'd give it a 10/10 but by the end I felt like it was 8/10 at best. I didn't like the way Waller lost her cool towards the end, it felt out of character. I like to imagine that her team who turned on her is fucked. However we didn't get to see that. Otherwise she was bad ass and scary in the beginning.

5) I didn't like the tone of the movie. I thought it was too bright, cheery, and campy. It had too much jokes. The beginning of the movie set a great tone in the beginning and then just sort of lightened up after that.

6) While I wouldn't mind it, I don't want James Gunn to do the sequel. I feel like the sequel would more or less be the same as this movie. If we use GOTG as a measuring stick we can get an example of that. GOTG2 while great failed to recapture the magic of the first one. It just felt repetitive.

7) Feel like Gunn made some unnecessary stylish choices such as the sequence when Harley was escaping. The whole bit with the flowers in the background didn't make sense to me. Another one being the the dating sequence with the dictator. There were plenty of unnecessary added flair or scenes in this movie. 

 I'd like to see a new director and team for the sequel. I would bring back Deadshot, Killer Croc, and maybe Katana for the sequel. Have Gunn executive produce the movie. I feel like this franchise could be flexible in this regard. Hell, let Taika Waitit get a shot at it or a horror director. I'd like to see Ari Aster take on Suicide Squad.

I know my cons outweigh the pros but I'll admit that I'm nitpicking a lot. The movie was great and I highly recommend it.",oyxaam
h802jz9,This movie is probably the most fun I’ve had with a comic book movie in a long time. It’s also got the emotions down pat. The entire ending sequence is a just a giant callback.

I went into this film only expecting a fun summer flick. I figured that I would end up liking it, but it would fade away from my memory. However, I was absolutely blown away. James Gunn did a great job at adapting characters and the cast all did great, but I think the cinematography and writing is what really shined here. The way that every shot seems outside the box and moves with the characters truly creates a sense that you are looking at panels on a graphic novel. On top of that, the quick zoom ins and whip-arounds are stylized similar to the way a story flows on the pages of a comic. I think the newer RED camera systems they used were definitely useful. There are also some shots that look like beautiful character illustrations, such as >!King Shark meeting his new “friends” or Harley Quinn’s wonderfully twisted fight scene against the guards!< The time stamps/jumps also create a sense of chapters, especially how they blend in with the environment. I could be totally overthinking the thought that went into the movie, but I was impressed nonetheless. I can’t wait to see what comes next. :)",oyxaam

My only gripe? I don't think Gunn really ***gets*** Waller.

She's not meant to be a female Nick Fury. She's meant to be the most heartless ""for the greater good"" type of character. The type that shoots a kid in one leg and then forces the dad to work for her so the next shot is not to the head.

Not the ""oh, you hit me with a golf club and disobeyed my orders? I'll send you to the HBOX MAX spin-off starring John Cena as punishment "".

Everything was good up until that post-credit scene, I was totally expecting her to feed her staff to King Shark or something even worse.

Also, sleeping on the job while her team is one of the most crucial missions ever? What the...No, seriously. What the?

PS. Flag's death was really good although I feel that having a last radio talk with Waller was needed. Maybe even revealing that despite promises to the contrary, Waller **did** inject Flagg with a microchip since she never truly trusted him.

We never even saw her reaction to his death. Definitely a wasted opportunity.",oyxaam

But I really didn't care about the characters. At all.

The whole style took over the film to a point where it kept the viewer at arms length from ever really engaging with the characters. They tried to ladle on some meaning with Rat's father story and Bloodsport's daughter but it was never built upon. It was trying to be meaningful backstory that had little meaning to the story itself.

As others have said, the middle dragged. I don't really know what King Shark added besides comedic relief and just exaggerating the suspension of disbelief that kept the whole thing absurd.

But it was fun. It just misses the part where you actually care about people. That's the hardest part of antiheroes but it can be done. Just wasn't done here.",oyxaam

And I didn't know it was from the guy who directed Guardians of the Galaxy. Love those movies and this guy's style. Big props to the staff really. I think the movie came together just right in all the right ways. 

Now I'm not a giant comic fan to know much about their original portrayals, but I enjoyed how the characters came across and the balance between comedy and seriousness. I loved Rat Catcher and Sebastian (even though I too hate rats). LIke...why are there so f u c k i ng many???

Even got me to enjoy watching John Cena in a movie. But after watching Harley, I was expecting King Shark to just scream ""Oh, my god it's Beyoncé!"" 

Loved it. Hopefully we get some more DC movies with James Gunn and his crew because they really knocked it out the park with this one.",oyxaam

h7we5hp,"Solid film, but surely I can't be the only person who noticed a few plot holes:

* Why would Waller make Flag leader of the diversion team? Given that Peacemaker killed him, Waller probably views him as being as expendable as the rest of the squad, but that doesn't seem like a sensible explanation in-universe, and if at any moment he asks Team 2 why they showed up immediately after Team 1 was merked, or Bloodsport mentions ""sounds like you were supposed to be a diversion mate"" he'd put 2 and 2 together. I think it would have been absolutely hilarious if Waller made 2 teams, one with meme-tier villains to be the bait and then highly competent supervillains to actually get the job done, and then manipulates Blackguard into selling the meme team out, but Blackguard's such a dumbass he gets the Corto Maltese beaches mixed up and sends the military to where the A-Team is landing instead, and the movie follows Team 2 trying to complete the mission (but then again I'm not a Hollywood screenwriter, maybe this is actually a worse idea)
* When the Squad were the only ones not possessed by Starro, why did he let them go free instead of trying to have his drones take them out? It would have made sense if he told them he would give them the opportunity to escape as repayment for (even inadvertently) letting him escape
* The scene where the squad decides to defy Waller and go after Starro doesn't make sense, because they have no way of knowing that she's going to be taken out by her lackeys before she can pop skulls, it would have been better if they had the squad argue with her until Crawley says ""I knocked Waller out, you can go ahead""

Overall solid 4/5 star movie, one of the few movies I can think of where I've wanted to see it again immediately, with the visuals and soundtrack and humour and overall intensity, it'll be a travesty if this isn't nominated for an Oscar like the first one was",oyxaam
h7yjapp,I like suicide squad but i think its dumb to kill of so many fan favorites just for shock factor. Like im sure the excuse is “ anything can happen” but heck doesn’t mean just mass kill characters,oyxaam
h7z8cbe,"Somewhat surprisingly I didn't care for this as much as I thought I would. I like James Gunn, Guardians of the Galaxy is my favorite MCU movie, his 'crew' of people he likes to work with are all great, and it's clear people like working with him, too. There's a lot of praise and good things I can say about The Suicide Squad as it is. But it just kinda didn't really do anything for me overall. 

Guardians felt so fresh and well realized. Confident in its irreverence and it arguably single-handedly changed the trajectory of Comic Book Movies toward more fully embracing their *Comic Bookiness*. The Suicide Squad felt more like punching the clock by comparison. Visually accomplished, well presented, well acted, funny, well choreographed etc. But more rote, too.

I dunno, just wasn't really 'for me' I suppose. I didn't hate it, and I genuinely did laugh out loud at several moments, but I think if I had to grade it, it was like a 75/100 type of thing. Solid, enjoyable, not shit, but didn't feel that next level greatness, is all.",oyxaam

h8lb4ye,"I have some questions after watching the movie, I know many of you are gonna tell me to just suspend my disbelief but I find it very hard to do so when stuff impacts the whole movie plot.

What was stopping Ratcatcher 2 from grabbing her light in minute 1 after they landed and summon 8 million rats like she did in the end to just *do the mission* for her? 

The trick to survive Starro's mini stars was... covering your face? Really? Even with just a leather mask or, like Harley did, your arm? No one thunk about that earlier? And on that note...

Starro is an incredibly weak menace, once you put on a shitty BDSM mask his attack of choice is walking over stuff? Polkadot didn't aim at his eye (which is dumb) but the rats were already fucking it up before Harley just cut his eye open like it's butter with a regular ass javelin - Ratcatcher 2 and Polkadot are way deadlier than Starro and they're not kept in a magic tower in ~~Cuba~~ Corto Maltese.

Nothing bad can happen to Harley, that much is clear - she can't be helped or saved by anyone and will always get out of any situation by herself - but that makes the character incredibly uninteresting, she's basically Goku right now. Actually, even the rest of the cast didn't so much as get injured (except Nanaue) unless they were immediately going to die, there was no struggle or real sense of confrontation at all.

It was miles better than the first Suicide Squad, but it has some glaring flaws that I can't overlook - sadly.",oyxaam

James Gunn is pro-child. Several scenes have characters being repulsed that someone is killing children. See, Twitter! (He long ago posted some weird jokes on Twitter. Temporarily got him canceled.)

The Milton bit was funnier than anything in an MCU movie.

I personally liked the costumes of the first, though this is clearly the superior movie.

h8nplru,"Not a fan of this movie. As a person who is selective over super hero movies they like, this one just felt very run of the mill. I was hoping for something different. Keep in mind I did not see the first suicide squad. I didnt like the wholesome story between rat catcher 2 and bloodsport. This movie should have been anything but wholesome. Humor was very forced and out of place like 90% of recent super hero movies. Take for example the polka dot man’s mother gag. It wasn’t funny the first time they showed it and then they ran with it. 

Yes some characters died but you knew which ones were going to live and have a happy ending. I can say the action was generally great and I enjoyed some of the characters. 5/10 for me.",oyxaam
h82fvya,[deleted],oyxaam
h7z013n,"The competence of this movie’s craft is so far above the first Suicide squad it’s insane. Gunn made a story that checked all the boxes for what makes the ‘concept’ of a suicide squad movie interesting in the first place — having super powered criminals do the dirty work for the American govt that normal superheroes cannot. He also flourished with the ultra violence and killing that you can’t get away with in normal superhero movies while still hitting strong emotional beats and making you root for the characters. And, it’s clear that he just really gets it — he gets comic book culture, he gets video game culture, and he gets how to adapt what we like about those kinds of things into movie form. 

The only thing I don’t like about this movie is some jokes and moments that are smarmy Gunn brand flourishes, where I can almost visualize him smirking and patting himself on the back for his genius when he’s writing them down. Many of the sex jokes, the ‘anything the first movie can do I can do better’ bonding bar scene.. and, I didn’t vibe with the needle drops (e.g. the pixies) like I did with gotg vol 1.

Otherwise, the movie is really impressive. It’s so well made, it almost doesn’t deserve to be this well made, lol.",oyxaam

Decent movie, comedy is great! But I feel it doesn't keep the same story/comedy balance that Gunn's other notable movies like GOTG managed to keep.

My only complaint is how they did Starro dirty. Motherfucker gives the Justice League a hard time, but he's defeated by a buncha rats and a javelin? That's some bullshit.

By the way, it's funny how mass death was treated as either a throwaway detail or a joke throughout the movie.

Weasel killed 27 children? That's a joke! Har har!

The Suicide Squad killed about a dozen of Sol Soria's people by mistake? No problem! She'll still help them and call them heroes at the end of the movie. I guess she wasn't good friends with any of the people they violently murdered.

Hundreds of innocent people died when Starro rampaged through a neighborhood in Corto Maltese, and on top of that, anyone face-hugged by him automatically dies? Oh well!

h7x9mhu,"I liked it, but didn't love it. I felt like it was generally too long: the whole ""Meanwhile, Harley"" sequence didn't really add anything to the larger narrative, and the finale went on so long that by the time the team were finally getting ready actually to fight Starro, I was pretty ready for the movie to just wrap it up already. Additionally, the whole redemption arc felt a bit basic and very much a retread of the first film – I couldn't believe they even gave the new sharp-shooter leading man a young daughter he wanted to make proud – though obviously executed somewhat better.  

For what it's worth, I also really wasn't into the post-credit scene with Peacemaker, which I thought was a very boring tease, and took away from the film's apparent ballsiness by having him somehow survive Idris Elba's magic bullet (especially when they already revealed that Weasel was still alive right before).",oyxaam

Really liked the characters and how the core group of the Squad was smaller and more focused than the first go round. Was surprised that I didn’t particularly care for Gunn’s direction with the exception of Harley Quinn’s escape and the kaiju battle, all the deaths were predictable, the chapter titles were unnecessary and overall I felt they could have hired any average director and gotten basically the same result.

h7y7p3t,"This’ll likely get buried but some thoughts I had about the film… 

It all feels a bit try hard but James Gunn’s batshit reincarnation of Task Force X more often than not works, at times surprisingly well, even if the film would’ve benefitted from a tighter script since more than a few jokes/gags misfire completely.  Still inventively shot, highly stylized splatter-rific action abounds featuring (but not limited to) extraterrestrial polka dots, a Great White demigod, the most ingenious use of a reflective helmet, one of DC’s most improbably iconic villains and in one choice solo sequence [Margot Robbie’s always fantabulous] Harley Quinn kicking so much fucking ass. Though incredibly off kilter, bombastically violent and rife with Gunn’s (sometimes much too much) sense of humor the film is kept grounded by its small, surprisingly strong character moments and emotional through lines even as the film threatens to swallow them whole as it careens to its gargantuan “kaiju up in this shit” final act. Despite the sometimes R-rated Guardians of the Galaxy feel and even with a few minor gripes (mismatched tonal issues) and some major ones (specifically the undermining of Viola Davis’ Amanda Waller and the continued dismantling of the “DCEU”) The Suicide Squad is still a go-for-broke, singularly twisted vision with a beating heart underneath all its vulgar, bloody trappings that while personally isn’t necessarily my choice squad, but, for the casual viewer is another win for DC.",oyxaam

When you think of the guardians films the characters really have well-developed emotional arcs and in this film I really didn’t feel it as much. James Gunn said he cried writing the script and idk. The movie is good but I feel like the movie could’ve had more heart (sorry flag.) specifically with polka dot man. I find the emotional moments in the guardians films VERY powerful.

I’m tired of movies insisting that female action characters run around doing stunts in high heels. I’m looking at you DC and Marvel that keeps putting Wonder Woman and Black Widow in pseudo-boots with high heels.",oyxaam
h84lptv,"I loved the movie but hated the beginning. It just felt like it was trying to make a joke by having all these characters in the trailer only to kill them all off in the beginning. Especially how they killed off Captain Boomerang like he was garbage, he should’ve been the main death of the film considering he was in the first one. 

But yeah, the characters that did survive however were amazing! Rick Flag and Polka Dot Man dying sucked but as the movie goes, no one is safe.

Harley was once again awesome as always.

King Shark was cool and funny.

Peacemaker was cool also and a twist not expected.

Bloodsport and Ratcatcher 2 killed it!",oyxaam

Because it’s possible I’m misremembering what I’ve seen.

I saw the film in U.K. cinemas last week. Because of the ratings system I can’t take my kid to see it. 
So we have a VPN and an HBO Max subscription and we are watching it again.

Does the US theatrical release have a shot of the Corto Maltese ruling family post execution by hanging in Waller’s PowerPoint?
Because I’m sure it was in the U.K. theatrical, but missed it in the VOD version. 

Please help. I’m going crazy!",oyxaam
h86jsqb,"I've got a nitpicky question - what was the deal with that hard drive? Why did they portray it that way instead of someone having a copy of a camera tape or something? The hard drive would've been SUPER encrypted, and then Idris Elba somehow uploads the footage to a secure server off screen? Is he a master hacker who carries a SATA to USB cable in his pocket? Did the rat upload the data?

Not really criticism of the film, I just feel like I missed something.

Also, you're lying to yourself if you don't accept they ripped off The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie with the chum buckets taking people over at the end.",oyxaam

h87ortm,"Lots of extremely corny and juvenile jokes that made me eye roll, but overall it was a really fun movie. It knew what kind of movie it wanted to be and wasn't afraid to go batshit crazy. There were some surprisingly heartfelt moments as well, Gunn is great at transitioning between silliness and real emotion.

Margot Robbie knocked it out of the park tbh, she's hilarious and literally crazy.

We need more movies that're willing to take risks like this, and less formulaic drivel.",oyxaam
h88ev1c,"My one gripe with the film I'd say and I realize that this is largely due to future plans and the studio not wanting to muddle it's properties, but I wish that there was a bit more building into the super villains aspect of the squad. For instance they brought up how Bloodsport put Superman in the ICU with the kyptonite bullet but it's not something the villains ever discuss. You'd think amongst a group of villains that would be discussed. We could have gotten a Green Lantern name drop from Polka Dot Man (that would be quite the light show to see on screen).  Also when Starro came up you'd think that would be something the Justice League would respond to.",oyxaam

h88wx5u,"Okay. I love this movie. It was well put together and was so excited to see King Shark!! I love that Harley Quinn wasnt shown to be this broken girl anymore she is such a badass and i think it was shown very well! I also love a queen who can spot a red flag. I love how they show her growth and the fact that she is super strong and really doesnt need anyone. I love the rat girl. She is me if i were to be a super hero. She is so caring about her squad and I loved that. The whole cast was amazing and John Cena dying was the icing on my cake. (I dont like him lol he is so fake!)  I love how protective they seemed over kids, like Harley and the lady in the office knocking out what's her face from abandoning that city. I love this. It is so much better than the first and i will most likey rewatch it again twice before it leaves HBO then go see it in Theaters. I'm a huge DC comic fan and this did my comics justice. It did the DCU justice and I think this is a step to getting the DCU the credit it deserves in box office hits lile MCU.",oyxaam

By that I mean a moment where your emotional investment in the characters is reflected by everything in the scene, the music, the sound effects, the wardrobe, the scenery, the action, the acting.  It did this not once but several times.  This movie made me happy.  ""I'm walking back and forth!""",oyxaam

h83fnz7,Such a great film. So much humour and great acting packed into two hours.

h87z8wl,"Overall it was good for what it is. 

However, I think that killing off half the members in the first five minutes was a mistake. I went it expecting to have that ""anyone can die at anytime"" vibe but in reality it wasn't anything like that imo.

It would have been cooler to see them gradually die throughout the mission or have the scene play out later in the movie when some connection with the characters had already been established. Rick Flag's death is an example of this. 

A similar approach would have raised the stakes and made it more entertaining.",oyxaam

Its a really fun movie, no holds barred. Nothing you will probably remember in some years, but its a fun ride to watch. I loved all of the bumblefucks, Starro was great - plot was weird, but understandable an did its job.

I want more Peacemaker. John Cenas brand of humor is unique and dangerous.",oyxaam
h7wzivm,"The reason why the MCU's joking and light tone worked in the beginning was because they were counterpunching against the norm (dumb action movies that took themselves too seriously) but now that everyone does it, the jokes don't land as well. The plot armor on Harley and Bloodsport basically made the movie tensionless by the end also why is the movie still introducing characters and expositing after an hour and 30 minutes that's just crazy. It had some great moments just too often marred by dialogue trying to be too cute and funny. Really happy that others loved it",oyxaam
h7xccnr,"This is one of those situations where the trailers kind of spoiled the story. Just based on all the footage from all the different advertisements, I could tell that most the characters walking in front of the giant flag, aka what ended up being “Team 1,” were basically cannon fodder. I knew they were going to die pretty fast because the ads kept recycling all of the same footage of Javelin, Mongal, TDK, etc. Still, it was kind of surprising how fast they dispatched Captain Boomerang. If I cared about his character at all I’d say they did him dirty.",oyxaam
h7xitql,"It was ok, fun, but not great.  Harley's action sequence was one of the stupidest I've ever seen, but I honestly never really liked the character in any iteration and at this point everything she does is cliché (but I'll always acknowledge Robbie's dedication and talent when playing the role).  Weasel was removed from the movie too soon, I guess he's going to become Malto Cortese's chupacabra now, but it will be interesting to see if Gunn uses him again.

EDIT:  Also, soundtrack was pretty good as usual, just ordered a copy, in ""starfish"" color vinyl, lol.",oyxaam
h7zdjin,I can't stress this enough. Anyone who liked this movie should watch the Harley Quinn animated show. It has the same tone and it also features a post joker Harley. And it also has King shark in it. It's also seriously really really good.,oyxaam
h80cz6o,I’d much rather Gunn make and other one of these than another sappy Guardians of the Galaxy Disney yankfest.,oyxaam
h80euul,"They are buffing the ever living shit out of Harley, first the plot armor torture ok naturally, then she caught that dude and even lifted both herself and him half a meter in the air, like cmon... I had about enough of her character popping everywhere evry since it became a popular edgy Halloween dress up idea.

Why the fuck did el presidente spill the beans to Harley about project starfish, or even have the whole hots for her, don't people know how crazy Harley is in this universe? 

I didn't expect them to kill captain boomerang nor did I expect Rick flag to die but kudos to James Gunn for making me care about him.

I don't know who bloodsport was but his weapons are magic.

Polka dot man was clearly a gonner the moment they decided to fight Starro, I mean, he was the only one who could hurt him and possible kill him it right.

Finally, I like that James Gunn went with the gore approach but he clearly did not over do it, he used it just right however I am stilling waiting for a woman henchmen to be gored to death, he even set up the female soldier captain guarding Starro but nop, she got away easy, I guess violently killing a henchwoman is still taboo for Hollywood like showing the killing of a dog for example.

I still can't believe they went ahead with fighting Starro, I fully expected a justice league semi cameo (something like showing a jet, a red flash etc (you know since they can't pay for the actual actors ""shared universe and all) arriving as the suicide squad hides and retreats.",oyxaam
h80kser,"The amount of positive reviews for this is surprising to me. Sure some of the jokes worked, but many overstayed their visit considerably. The backstories for Elba, Ratcatcher and the Polkadot guy were just shoved in there and seem shoddily added in. It's a very very meh movie.",oyxaam
h83fs1h,"Gunn knocks it out of the park with the soundtrack again too. First time we see Bloodsport we get a song about not being ready to carry the load and the final shot has him petting Sebastian with the song saying “I just wanted to be loved by you,” which is an obvious connection to the rat wanting his love but more a reflection of rats symbology to him, an abusive father that never gave him love.",oyxaam
h83rkge,"This movie is seriously awesome. It's among the best comic book movies of all time. I'm not surprised one bit tho: James Gunn is a genius and this is some of his best work. He perfectly balances out the tone as well as the action and comedy. I actually thought it was better than Guardians of the Galaxy (and this is coming from a hard-core marvel fan).

Can't recommend it highly enough. Just stop whatever you're doing right now and watch this movie, you won't be dissapointed.

9/10",oyxaam

Then, his one of his legs destroyed another building.",oyxaam

h8icivh,"This was pretty good. Nothing amazing or groundbreaking but the characters were likable and the good jokes outweighed the ones that fell flat. The special effects were kind of janky in places but it fit the B-movie aesthetic so it worked for me. This one definitely had more in common with Slither than Guardians of the Galaxy.

Btw, I can’t believe I’m still saying this in 2021 but it would have been nice if the whole damn movie wasn’t spoiled in the trailer.

Also, Margot Robbie is a treasure. That is all.

Edit: So is Idris Elba",oyxaam
ha3t8l8,"Wtf was that attack on the camp to rescue Flag? Enemies were just placed around at random and were more deaf and blind than videogame guards. In more than one instance they should've seen action happening directly in front of them, yet they didn't and were not ready. Nobody in the tent heard them either? Whoever was planning this scene should be fired.

Why was the random sex scene needed? That moment would've been thousand times better without it.

I wonder if Capaldi could play Rick Sanchez if that was ever needed.

That guy really had to sell that he can't pull off a rat from himself.

Powers: ""Can use anything as a weapon"". Reality: one has a big gun, other has a magic gun that can do everything.

You can always count on U.S. government to be worse than supervillains.

Okay, so how terrible was Suicide Squad and Birds of Prey that this gets so much praise? The action was mostly mediocre(and in some scenes very poorly planned), the humour was almost all forced, the plot was basic, weird editing, transitions and screen captions in some places and the tendency to try to cram a song everywhere? Is that really the best James Gunn can do here? It's like this movie has all the issues that people who hate Marvel say Marvel has. But Marvel is actually good, and this was...weird. Like, if Marvel was Pacific Rim, this is Pacific Rim: Uprising. I didn't hate the movie, but I don't think I understand the amount of praise.

I think they improved Harley Quinn a lot. She gets forced down our throats often in these movies but I think this was the first time where it was really acceptable because of how awesome she was here. Her breakout scene was the highlight of the film for me. RIP Colonel Flag

Excited for the future of this franchise and the  DCEU as a whole",oyxaam

h87xzzz,"I had a fun experience with this in the cinema, but the more I think about it the more I dislike it, its better than the first one, but the cheap shock value, and it still not having any real stakes sours me on it. The best Suicide Squad movie is still the animated one imho.",oyxaam
h88d2ih,"I loved this movie, probably my second favorite comic book movie behind Infinity Wars at this point.

I can see this one being re watchable.

The story movies so smoothly, even with the flashbacks. There's the right amount of characters that steal the show and those that provide fodder.

My main complaint is with the villains like The Thinker and the Maltese Generals. 

First the Thinker did not come off as a super genius. To the point I'm not sure why they wasted him on this movie. Plug some other doofus in here and use the Thinker down the line.

Second unleashing Starro on the world is going to fuck up your shit too eventually. I mean maybe you think Starro will put a big hurt down on America and then Superman will deal with it before it just ravages the whole world. But that's a pretty big gamble. but i get it ultimately the realistic aspects of an evil plan aren't that important in these kind of movies.


Harley was great as expected, but I found her to be better when she wasn't trying to make one liners. Example great moment when she grabs Javelins dead face and says ""give it to who!?"" Bad moment commenting on the rain as ejaculation from angels.",oyxaam

I get deadshot not leading which does feel like a copy and paste for bloodsport but its whatever mostly, smith didn't deliver too well with deadshot I feel like his charisma acting has been great for a while now.

h835ko2,"Liked it for all the same reasons everyone else said, but was kind of shocked how all over the place and checkbox-y the emotional themes were, considering those were Gunn's secret weapon on the Guardians movies.  
  
The actors sold it as best they could, but this movie's about... parental issues? Friendship? Cruel pragmatism in the name of the greater good? Bloodsport becoming a leader? U.S. foreign policy and propaganda? Red flags? That every lowly rat/person makes a difference? Standing up for your beliefs instead of following orders?  
  
Also, by the time in act 2 we've had the movie stop so that everyone can learn Polka Dot Man's origin, or Ratcatcher and Bloodsport are just trading long speeches explaining their backstories, you started to at least *understand* why the first movie tried to rapid-fire so many intros.",oyxaam
h840vn1,"I must say as much as I loved the movie I didn't like Harley's rampage escape.   


she was so over the top in this scene, I felt F9 tyrese gibson invincible vibes - and that's a very bad thing when it comes to emotional investment in a character.  


I get it, she's massivly OP in the comics as well and it's intended, but I don't like it there either.",oyxaam

It's like a mix of GotG, Doom Patrol and Harley Quinn animated series, the vibe of the movie was pretty fun and intense and I hope it will show those Warner clowns how good a comics based movie can be when you let the director work freely to materialize its vision",oyxaam
h87ala6,"It was surprisingly good. I mean, James Gunn always makes good movie, but all of the other DC universe movies have been absolutely terrible. It just goes to show that they could have been making great movies all this time if they hired somebody who knew what they were doing.",oyxaam

h88ibh2,"First off I'll state that I didn't really plan to go see this movie but it was the best option this weekend. I'm a comic fan and I see everything.  So, to be fair I'm not a Harley fan so the character is not a draw even though Margot rocks. Bloodsport was ok, but I truely didn't care about any character other than King Shark and he was the one with the least depth.  The action was horrible other than when Blackguard lost his.......no spoiler from me. It kind of seemed like I was watching the Ghostbusters take on the Staypuffed Marshmallow man.  Am I wrong.  I don't think so.  For all you Harley fans, she is better read in your head than on screen.  Man I wanted Peacemaker dead. John Cena will never be Dwayne. Anyway,  that is another topic.  For the record,  I loved the Snyder Cut of Justice League but this movie was shi.......I will say that the gore was the coolest part.  How people died worked. The jokes thought,  the writing was predictable and horrible.  I'm disappointed in JG, go back to GoTG.
I liked King Shark. Love the nibbies.",oyxaam

h7wbzwu,"It’s much better than the original. Is it amazing? I’d say….well….no. I’d break this movie down like this:

First 45 minutes: Excellent. Hilarious, awesome. Loved it.

Middle 45-60 minutes: Good. Worse than the opening, though. About equal to Birds of Prey, which I actually thought was OK.

Last 30-40 minutes: Really excellent again. Lots of fun and great stuff all around.

So a bit of a mixed bag. I really liked it, but it isn’t as good as Guardians of the Galaxy 1 or 2. I generally dislike the DC movies, though, and this is by far one of the top ones if not the best.

I’d recommend it. It really is quite fun despite a clunky middle portion of the movie that kind of sucked the fun away for awhile.

Thoughts?",oyxaam
h7wcd77, For me the First half of the movie wasn't that great. Second half was awesome . Movie was beautifully shot but none of the jokes landed at all for me. I will say Gunn has a talent for taking the most bland characters  and making them really cool. He did it with gotg and he did it here as well. I don't know any director who could do that. Except Mike Judge. I would give it a solid 7.5. Which is a good movie in my book.,oyxaam
h7wdy6w,"This movie is pretty good. I am kind of upset that the characters rarely felt like they were any any real danger. By the time they finally got around to giving a character you care about an unsanctimonious death it’s pretty obvious that they wouldnt do it again. Also maybe my tv just isn’t calibrated super well but I found the lighting in this to be harsh and ugly as hell. About on par with most Marvel stuff. Suffers from some of the same writing flaws they tend to fall into, but at least the presentation is new.",oyxaam
h7wfd4k,I loved Boomerangs little shrug before he gets chopped up by the helicopter,oyxaam
h7wfinh,"I loved the Presidents little visual parallel with the Joker -- in the first Suicide Squad Joker has that scene where he's  in a circle of knives, and when the president is laying down he's surrounded by the pistols.

Edit: 

Here's the [shot of the president](https://i.imgur.com/6FADsgS.png) that feels like a call back to the [Joker](https://i.imgur.com/bCcyTjp.gif)",oyxaam
h7wg40s,"Boomerang dying was kind of a big deal, right?  Especially right off the bat like that.  I hate Jai Courtney as much as anyone but his character seemed like a main character for the franchise.",oyxaam
h7wlv09,Was alright. When Pete Davidson said “is this a dog” that killed me,oyxaam
h7wmjwq,"I liked it, didn't love it. I would probably give it a 7-8/10.The action was great, all of the characters and actors were great, and Gunn's directing was overall good.

Margot, Melchior, and Elba all stole the show for me. I thought everyone was great, but these 3 did most of the heavy lifting and really elevated the movie. 

Margot just keeps getting better as Harley Quinn. She is just an incredible actress period. You can tell how committed she is to all of her roles, but especially Harley. Gunn and Robbie created the best version of Harley so far imo. This movie honestly left me wishing Gunn would direct a Gotham City Sirens movie.

Melchinor was a nice surprise. She is a very talented actress. She was the heart of the movie, made me emotional at times. Hope we get to see more of her in the future. 

Nobody should be shocked at how good Elba is. He brought strength and subtle vulnerbility to the movie/character. Watching this made me wish they just committed to Elba being Deadshot because Will Smith does not have the same presence as Elba. I enjoyed Will Smith in the first one, but I can't see him coming back as the leader when Elba is right there. 

The only things keeping this movie from being great is the pacing, the somewhat lackluster story, and some of the failed humor. Also I was getting kind of annoyed with how many times Gunn used the zoom in effect. I also did not like what happened with Waller. It really undermines her charceter. Those were minor gripes for me though. I think its a good movie, but not great like people are saying.",oyxaam
h7wnz00,[deleted],oyxaam
h7wo1ys,"Overall really enjoyed the movie but this habit of setting modern movies to songs from popular culture has got to stop IMO. Unless it's really well chosen and done, like in The Eternals' trailer, it kind of just takes me out of the movie. 

In any case, hilarious movie and gave all the main characters moments to show who they really were. Well done.",oyxaam
h7wppu2,First time I enjoyed watching Pete Davidson on screen.,oyxaam
h7wpxgk,This might be James Gunn's best work yet. I can imagine how much fun it wouldve been to come up with this story and given the go ahead from the studio to do whatever the fuck you wanted.,oyxaam
h7wq24z,"I loved this movie. It was equal parts hilarious, touching and action packed and im happy for James Gunn to direct all comic book movies going forward

Also, I thought the dancer on the stage in the club looked a hell of a lot like Pom Klementieff and it turns out I was right and it was her! Surprised I haven't seen anybody else mention it here",oyxaam
h7wrcdo,"I thought this movie was mediocre at best. Reminded me of the gotg 2.  I still enjoyed it. And Gunn's still genius to me.  But this film just didn't do it for me.  It felt very much like an r rated marvel film instead of something completely different, which bodes well for Deadpool..

All in all I have it a 61/2..

This I love though are Cena and elba. Both guys were great as usaul.. even if it was clear they show horned Elba into the will Smith role. I think Elba is way better so that didn't even bother me. This was also probably a tiny better version of Harley than Birds of prey,even though I actually liked that movie as well.   What's clear to me is Warner's stayed out of the way and let Gunn  do his thing. I think this film fits snuggly into the znydér verse and they should fire all the studio heads in charge and just let Snyder do his thing and surround him other film makers doing different things to change the pace.  I fear that if this is successful we will just have the mcm part 2 instead of something different. 

Either way it was still entertaining and I am looking forward to gotg 3. But please please wb don't homginize the dceu like marvel did the mcm . The best thing they could do is let the Snyder finish his deal but surround that with different styles of films for the solo outings. Don't be like marvel and just same damn movie over and over.",oyxaam
h7wtka8,I didn’t think it could be done. But they made smoking even cooler than when Joker did it. That whole scene inside the truck was shot so well.,oyxaam
h7wtko6,"Goddamn that lived up to the hype.

And I *knew* Peacemaker would survive and that the spin-off was a sequel, not a prequel. Something ALWAYS felt off to me about them insisting it was a prequel.",oyxaam
h7wtmu9,"This was great. They killed everything that made the original movie such a damn mess. The original took 45 minutes to actually get to the mission, the plot made no sense, the stakes feel imaginary, flashbacks were drunken LSD dreams, the team had no development or chemistry with each other, the action was terrible, the soundtrack was silly, and it just wasn't fun.

The result of letting James Gunn helm this is instantly one of my favorite comic-book movies I've seen. Not a second of the movie is wasted from the moment it starts and the pace, very much like his first Guardians of the Galaxy film, is really on point making the movie super easy to rewatch. The laughs are all over the place with funny gags and great dialogue, the action hits and has one of the best sequences you'll see in a superhero movie, and the cast is so well-balanced that it's actually hard to pick a stand-out. Margot Robbie is still playing one of the best and most comic-accurate performances put to screen, Idris Elba gets to flex a lot more range than I think the trailers imply for him, John Cena is a highlight for sure, and I think some characters that people may have been expecting very little from also impress.

I give it 8.5 Miltons out of 10.",oyxaam

h7x9cz9,Wow I think I’m either getting old or taking for granted how much better these movies are in packed theaters because I thought most of the jokes were corny as fuck and besides the brutal sudden deaths I didn’t laugh much.

h7xg26v,"The fact that this Suicide Squad literally sent in a suicide squad at the beginning, made me extremely excited in an indescribable way. Gunn clearly understands how to make a comic book movie and I absolutely fucking loved it. This is why you let creators have control and tell their story.",oyxaam
h7xg5j5,"Here’s the movie we’ve all been waiting for! DC’s big comeback from that crappy Suicide Squad is here! With James Gunn on the helm, we have the DC Superhero film that we all needed. A fast-paced action romp with lots of humour and style to it. This is one of those movies you need to see on the big screen to get the most out of it, and a couple of friends.

With Idris Elba leading a group of different characters with various powers and personality traits, the film keeps things interesting and fresh with many gags and dialogue sequences to bounce off on. Margot Robbie returns as Harley Quinn and she gets a good balance here of not being too annoying, and the villain has a good payoff by the end. No scene is wasted and the film strikes a good tone of goofy and seriousness.

Not only that, it looks and sounds very good as well. The movie never drags, everything is explained well and the action sequences are gory fun and well executed. Soundtrack is used excellently and the special effects are great. Much better than that overrated Zack Snyder’s Justice League. 7.5/10",oyxaam

Margot Robie can act and it's going to be hard to beat her Harley Quinn, she is definitely the Harley Quinn.

James Gunn killed it, better than I expected and I liked it far more than most DCEU movies. Hope they sign a Trilogy with him, who knew Disney firing him would be better for him.

Its clear this version is inspired by the version from the animated Harley Quinn show, but that show was capable of making him look as scary as is possible for a great white in that style of animation. 

Great movie but the great white just didnt have a big enough mouth to really seem super scary and the water scene seemed to only be in the film for King Shark and yet he does nothing there. It feels like he does get a water scene that was cut out, probably because his design here just looks too dopey to come off scary even in water. 


Otherwise great movie.",oyxaam

I felt like I saw a kids movie, for the most part the film is boring and unfunny.
If they had spent all the cgi effects on a good plot and screenplay.....we would have gotten a decent film.

The first film was atleast darker in tone and more serious,this is just outright bad and the humour is more cringe than funny.

The fucking ratcatcher girl could've gone to corto Maltese and pointed that instrument towards the beast and the whole movie would've been over.
That's how bad the script and writing is.

And Harley Quinn is not John wick for fuck sake,atleast make the action scenes believable. 

Although it had gore and violence,it had it for the sake if having it,it wasn't blending with the script so this according to me is a kids movie.",oyxaam

It was the wow I really enjoy this movie kinda laugh not I find it cringe laugh. Every character was spot on and funny. Idris I thought was gonna be just a rip off Deadshot/Will's character. Thank God he wasn't. He carried this movie with humor and heart. I haven't had a good laugh like that in a while. Margot did a fantastic job as always. Especially under Gunn's direction. She became her own entity in this with no Joker involved which the birds of prey movie failed to do. King Shark is awesome...John Cena's role as Peacemaker was also awesome and funny. Cena played it seriously when he needed and did it well. 

Also Polka dot man...he throws polka dots...that right there made him the funniest guy haha.

Better than Deadpool, because it isn't a Ryan Reynolds narcissistic wankfest. It's what Deadpool could have been with less Reynolds control. 

Indris Elba was amazing. John Cena and the rest of the cast raised their game. Margot Robbie is Harley as much as RDJ was Tony Stark. 

Hats off to that talented pervert James Gunn. He did it with Guardians, he did it again with Suicide Squad. It takes a hell of a leader to get so many great actors to put aside their egos to just die gruesomely on screen.

I was not happy about Boomerang dying literally 5 minutes into the film lol. I screamed “NOOO!” in the theater and then when he put up his glowing boomerang I was like “YES!”. 
Also I loved Polka-Dot Man. David nailed that role so well. I was pretty pissed that he died but he went out with a bang. I could relate to him because I have serious mother issues like he did. 
Laughed my ass off in the theater at the part where Idris Elba went “Look, it’s your mom!” and points to the giant starfish and it looked like his literal mother. That shit had me dying of laughter.

And Starfish has the ability to crush buildings with a single step, but can’t figure out to just step on the rats or flop on them to squish them?

He is irredeemable by the end of this movie, so why would I want to watch a show about him? It's not that I don't like him because he is villain, it's that he is very very written poorly.

the beginning scene was so brutal. the lead up to “saving” Flagg, where Peacemaker and Bloodsport were trying to one-up each other, was hilarious. 

“no one likes a show off.”

“unless what they’re showing off is dope. as. fuckkkk.”

“fuck! that’s true.”

I also fucked with the cinematography heavily. the scene where they were running down the street and the camera panned up to see Starro destroying the city in the background was straight out of a video game. a lot of great continuous shots too. 

highlights include everyone’s acting. everyone put in work. I loved Viola Davis as Waller especially, I’m glad she got to come back and do it again (after nailing it in 2016!). we need movies that are written like this one to come back into style, everything had a point in this movie and none of the characters made out-of-character decisions. they got it right on this one. I’m hoping DC can continue down this road.",oyxaam
h7wfor3,"It was really good and violent.

It almost loses the thread during the third act (I really couldn't care less about all the hard drive stuff) but recovers really well. The Peacemaker v Flagg was pretty great so I guess that's all that matters... it just didn't really emotionally resonate with me.

She's basically a quirky woman in clown makeup with good fighting skills. Her fans keep trying to prop her up as an iconic character, but this is the third time mainstream audiences have ignored them. (BoP and the Harley Quinn animated series didn't attract large audiences.) She can't carry a film. She can barely carry a comic.

**James Gunn is a creep.** People who like gross things have mental issues. His twitter jokes weren't funny, they were just gross. He uses licensed music to compensate for his poor writing.

**James Gunn fans scared people away.** His creepy fans attacked anybody who didn't support this film. They laugh at a joke because the word ""butthole"" is in it. Harley Quinn's joke about the rain is pathetic, but they think jokes like that are hilarious. Their negativity did a lot of damage.

**It's a tonal mess.** It has violence that is aimed at adults, but messages about family and importance suited for children. It makes no sense.

Maybe the writer for Harley has always seemed like that but her jokes just never work that great. 

Part of me thinks it is fine. Her jokes dont need to be funny, just that she is silly and crazy. 

But i think when she kills the president, that is the only one that ever really works. That is the silly mixed with crazy. I dont need to laugh out loud for it to work it just needs to be both of those things. Most the rest of the time she is just silly.

Compare to Nolans Joker. He isnt hysterical funny. But the fact he is making jokes while shoving someones head into a pencil is what works.

h843t5i,"I liked it on the whole but not as much as the majority:

-Awesome character concepts and interactions. Gunn’s flair for the weird is perfect for Suicide Squad

-i wish I hadn’t watched the trailers. Was clear most of the B squad wouldn’t survive, so opening scenes didn’t have the same impact and it was clear they were all going to die. It still worked, but I wonder if seeing them die one by one throughout the film would’ve been more impactful. Could’ve seen squad kill each other more which would be perfectly fitting. Probably impossible with movies length as this would take away from other characters but meh

-First and third acts felt a bit disjointed when timelines jumped around. Very comic book-like which I’m sure was intentional, but didn’t work for me

-Really didn’t like Harley’s romance. This was her only character development in the movie and I hated it. I know much of her character is based on dysfunctional relationships, but this felt forced and didn’t really make sense that the whole country wanted Harley as queen. Would’ve preferred to see Harley have this relationship with a member of the Squad, allowing her to have more interactions with other cast. Loved her capture and escape though.

-Also hated the general/president being part of the plot at all. They were plot devices that could easily have been replaced with the Thinker, who was criminally underused and wasted. 

-Elba was great as usual and Bloodsport’s design and weapons were badass. He was clearly just a last minute Deadshot though, and at least I would’ve loved to see a gag highlighting this. His relationship with Ratcatcher needed one more scene to develop. 

-Loved Peacemaker’s betrayal at the end, but I wish his moral code had received a bit more development to really nail this payoff. His ruthlessness in the movie was great and it’s nice to see another wrestler get a chance to show his acting chops

-Peacemaker and Bloodsport rivalry was awesome as others have said.

-Waller was just great. Would love to see her woven into other DC movies

-Shark and Polka Dot Man were great. Once again, would’ve liked to see some more development 

-Flag’s death was great. Character was redeemed from terrible first movie and his death hit hard. 

-Starro was just awesome. Creepy and intimidating in the best way and the perfect villain for this movie.

-The bar scene could’ve been done better. I actually would’ve preferred a bar scene like the first movie with more interaction, to flesh out their relationships",oyxaam

h7vzx3s,"James Gunn absolutely nailed that. Everyone from the big movie stars to the lesser known actors were really good and all the characters were written really well. Margot Robbie, Idris Elba were great, but John Cena fucking stole the show. Great action, great comedy. 9/10",oyxaam
h7vzy71,"Nice touch that some of the actors used argentinian slang, even tough they couldn't do the accent, except for the president, perfect argentinian accent.

h7w10n8,"Speaking as a bartender, the squad’s reactions to drinking Fernet (especially Polka-Dot Man) for the first time was great and surprisingly realistic. The stuff is definitely an acquired taste, and it’s weird that this is the second DC property to feature it after TDKR (it’s the drink Alfred has in Italy).",oyxaam
h7w13sp,Gunn actually made me care about Flagg. I'm blown away at the depth they squeezed into these characters!,oyxaam

h7w1bpq,Any idea what the song at the beginning of the credits is?,oyxaam
h7w1lsc,"I've never been one for absurd violence. That said, there are many style decisions with this film that make it stand out. 

Bloodsport's versatility. Peacemaker's onslaught. Harley's momentum. Rick Flag's strategy. King Shark's carnage. Even less 'physical' members like Polka Dot Man and Rat Catcher 2 have their own manner of dealing with situations. >!You also see brief instances for the 'expendable' squad at the beginning (which they used before their outlandish deaths).!< 

Each member has a distinct aesthetic that fits their 'brand'. That leaves the over-the-top violence, while a bit much at times, still visually interesting and easier to stomach. Major kudos to Gunn for ensuring that each character felt distinct.",oyxaam

h7w4hy9,Saw this in uk a week early this was great the whole squad had their time to shine and all of them were great characters also >!flags death and poki dots were well done and sad!<,oyxaam

h7w50bd,I’m pretty sure that the boomerang kill where he sliced the skull diagonally was foreshadowing Jotunheim being cut in half in the same manner.,oyxaam
h7w55xy,Loved the movie. I really appreciated the Harley scenes. I was afraid that she would be cringy and screen entitled but quite the opposite.,oyxaam
h7w588c,This movie is in my top 5 comic book films now. What a damn fun ride!,oyxaam
h7w5rbs,"I am blown away how much fun this movie was. It's not even comparable to the first one, James Gunn did a great job with it. Saw it in theater and the entire crowd was laughing hysterically throughout, such a fun experience. I never thought I'd be sympathizing with a rat and a half shark half human as much as I was.",oyxaam
h7w5rhi,"What a fun fucking movie!!!  Give James Gunn all the fucking money and all the freedom to do whatever the fuck he wants with it.

Edit: Hey Disney, I DARE you to let Guardians 3 be allowed to be rated 'R'.",oyxaam
h7w5und,"Daniela Melchior absolutely KILLED it as Ratcatcher II and was the heart of the film. That close up shot of her in the climax commanding the army of rats to attack Starro as they wash over her, tears streaming down her face as she remembers her father’s explanation of “why rats” (shoutout to Taika) made me genuinely emotional, which I did not expect at that moment. 

I also loved Bloodsport’s first interaction with his daughter when she came to visit him. At first I was worried they might retread the whole “his daughter is his soft spot” thing they did to humanize Deadshot in the 2016 Suicide Squad and I was SO glad when they just started yelling and telling each other to fuck off. His relationship with Ratcatcher II really worked in my opinion and I loved their exchange on the bus. His final showdown with Peacemaker was awesome, particularly the callback to the smaller bullet jab from the first act, and he just looked fucking badass when he dropped from the floor above and stared Peacemaker down. Lastly, that shot of him finally embracing Sebastian as he slept on his knee and overcoming his long held trauma was a fitting end for the movie. 

Margot Robbie’s monologue after Harley shoots Presidente Luna was so funny and perfectly executed. It was hilarious how Gunn kept cutting back and forth between Harley, completely engrossed in this earnest speech about her own evolution with relationships, and Luna, crawling on the floor, his eyes full of shock, as he bled out. That final line about how she couldn’t believe that gun actually had bullets was the perfect cap on the scene. And of course, the entire sequence of Harley single-handedly escaping captivity and massacring Luna’s men was unreal, and the animation (which I actually wasn’t crazy about in the trailer) was such a perfect touch. Her little interruptions while the team lays out the ground rules for the Thinker (another thing I didn’t particularly love in the trailer) played so well too. This may be an unpopular opinion but Margot Robbie’s Harley never really did it for me before this movie — not because of her acting ability but simply because of how her character was written — and this movie completely changed my mind. 

More generally, I really appreciated the non-chronological structure of Gunn’s storytelling and his willingness to rewind at key moments and show us things from a different perspective. When things lined up it was incredibly satisfying and it was just a really imaginative way to tell a story that would’ve been much duller if those opportunities weren’t taken. Also, those titles creatively incorporated into scenes were all fantastic and added a ton of personality to the movie. I’m also just constantly in awe of Gunn’s ability to so adeptly walk the line between irreverent humour and emotional vulnerability, which he did on multiple occasions throughout the film.",oyxaam
h7w5xml,A million times better than the first one.  DC needs to use Gunn more often.  Dude just gets how to make fun comic book movies.,oyxaam
h7w64bv,"This is certainly one of my favorite DC Movies in recent years besides Wonder Woman, Shazam!, and Birds of Prey.",oyxaam
h7w6dyv,Can we talk about those transitions between the scenes? They were so friggin' creative and the most comic booky ass things in the whole movie. I want more directors doing things like that that move each scene along. It was very Edgar Wright-esque.,oyxaam
h7w6f32,Cena and Elba were great together. I loved the “no one like a show” off scene.,oyxaam
h7w6i3a,Rick Flagg :(,oyxaam
h7w6ygi,"The only thing that really bugged me about this film was the intro. I felt like the first 10 minutes (before the second team is introduced) was shot by a completely different director. I thought the way the intro was put together felt rushed and didn't make me feel invested at all, not sure if perhaps it was intentional. Just thought the editing of it all was super bland, but again... after the second team is introduced and the introduction credits continue... that is when it feels like the real movie is beginning.",oyxaam
h7w7g9b,"FUN movie. 

The banter between Peacemaker and Bloodsport was just gold...entire theater was cackling. And my favorite visual was the flowers behind HQ as she did her jailbreak scene.",oyxaam
h7w7hxq,"Idris Elba was awesome, but that was supposed to be Deadshot and I wish Will Smith had came back.",oyxaam
h7w7l03,Movie of the year!! Man they really toyed with me when they kept teasing King Shark getting killed.,oyxaam
h7w7s7r,Still sad about Rick Flag,oyxaam
h7w7thi,I could tell this was a James Gunn movie just from the music.,oyxaam
h7w7vho,So Amanda Waller is ruthless but her employees dick around behind her back and are a bit silly? They also can knock her unconscious and still live to see another day? That was my only problem with the movie.,oyxaam
h7w7y0z,"Honestly, give James Gunn the DCU at this point",oyxaam
h7w80sw,I love peace and I’ll kill every man woman and child I have too to achieve it- Peacemaker Lmao that line had me rolling,oyxaam
h7w84oe,"How can I say this in a way that isn't insulting to the actor? Like, I mean this as praise for the the CG artists, but Weasel looks *A LOT* like Sean Gunn.",oyxaam
h7w87nn,I really enjoyed it but my expectations were definitely way too high. The best part about Gunn is that he's a very flashy director but it's never over the top.,oyxaam
h7w8ctm,"Loved the movie.

There's a lot of times when watching ensemble action movies where you might say, ""X should have done A and not Y"" or ""it would make more sense for X to do Y but they did B instead"".

I did not experience that moment during this movie.  It was kind of perfectly constructed.",oyxaam
h7w8o3h,"This is a proper Suicide Squad movie.

Also, Courtney can't catch a break.",oyxaam
h7w98dc,95 on Rotten Tomato’s and 75 on meta? Is the movie actually good? (This is coming from someone who actually liked the first one),oyxaam

h7wcn9q,glory to ~~glorzo~~ starro!,oyxaam
h7wcr03,Everyone wants to see more of these characters but that just gives them more opportunities to kill them off lol I was pretty satisfied with who made it out in the end. Though there's a few dead characters I'm dying to see more of. Did they ever establish a year that this took place in? It felt very timeless to me so I could see lots of opportunities for stories that take place before this,oyxaam
h7wcxig,"I just kept wondering, why didn't Starro possess the squad? Like, no one had a mask except Ratcatcher so it seems so obvious! 

I will say tho, I'm glad there weren't any Easter eggs or references to the old suicide squad movie; that deserves to be a lost memory",oyxaam
h7wd12r,Why was rat catcher either asleep or tired in most scenes? Is there something I missed?,oyxaam

The Suicide Squad or Guardians of the Galaxy",oyxaam
h7wezal,Was that Josh Brolin in the paddy wagon?,oyxaam
h7wezvo,"I am someone who dislikes the typical MCU formula while loving more adult-oriented superhero stuff like Invincible and The Boys.

I felt like this was a good mix of the two. It wasn’t the greatest thing in the world and not every joke landed but it managed to be funny or most of it and actually felt like there were consequences despite the plot being somewhat predictable.

The fight choreography was also great but I am really annoyed that the best sequence was nearly ruined by unnecessary CGI. I am really glad it was rated R as well. 7/10",oyxaam
h7wf8s2,I think Guardians and this are now 1 and 1a for me post-Dark Knight comic book movies.  Really didn't think that would happen.,oyxaam

h7wfbqt,"Definitely better than the first one, although it doesn’t take much to accomplish that",oyxaam
h7wfgy9,"So I just checked out the trailer.  Did people figure out that Pete Davidson's team would be a red herring?  It looks like there are enough shots of the group to tell that several are missing.  You've got one team doing a heroic walk, then you got the other team doing theirs, with some duplicates from the first team.  Then you've got the classroom scene which was only people from Elba's team.  And virtually none of Davidson's team was shown in any action clips.",oyxaam

h7wg4fk,Does anyone know why Katana was in the cast credits for this movie? you think she will be in some deleted scenes?,oyxaam
h7wgad8,In hindsight it seems like Waller had Blackguard let the Corto Maltese army know they were gonna show up and didn't loop Flag in on that.,oyxaam

Also, Ratcatcher 2 my surprise favorite.

Thinker really didn't have much to do.

that woman may be crazier than half the team",oyxaam
h7wiaol,"I knew people had to die in the **Suicide** Squad, but it seemed at one point like they were just lining people up to die. A few of the deaths weren't even because it was a crazy mission, just because of stupidity - like Polka Dot Man.

I started liking Harley Quinn more as the movie went on - that random diversion with the dictator guy was pretty damn pointless. I guess I'm just not that big a fan of the way they over saturate these movies with her character - the schtick gets kind of old.

John Cena was great, stole the show at times. I don't fully agree that Peacemaker would take the last steps of his downfall the way he did. But at least he'll be back :D",oyxaam

Everything about it is being praised ad nauseum (and rightfully so), so I'll highlight something I'm not seeing a lot of praise for: the fucking costumes. Holy hell, everyone looked so damn good, especially Ratcatcher 2 and Bloodsport. Bloodsport's mask is absolutely sick, and the fact that his gimmick is he has the same exact gun all over his body, which he can then combine into bigger guns, is so fucking cool. Agh I love the character design in this.",oyxaam

The MCU is heading down a bad path after Endgame, because now they are just making movies that don’t need to be made for the plot. Black Widow was just filler for money.

h7ws6q0,"I really really liked this movie some of the comedy didn’t work but the bits that did were so funny, I liked the plot and character stuff a lot and the visuals were really really good at pointe. They managed to get development out of all the large cast. Only complaint is they took down Starro fairly easily other than that really enjoyed the movie and I don’t really get the complaints.",oyxaam

h7wsvdq,“It’s getting Kaiju in this bitch!”,oyxaam
h7wt2kv,"I was on the fence about this movie, but James Gunn nailed it. He made everyone on the team useful, endearing and unique. Idris killed it, Daniela was great, David was great, and even John Cena was good. He's come a long way since The Marine. Joel Kinnaman was actually pretty good now that his dialogue actually works (mostly). And I'm not a fan of movie Harley Quinn for multiple reasons, but when you handle her right she's a real gem. A little forced but still, Margot can carry the role. I even liked her more in BoP compared to the first Suicide Squad.

That said, I think they made Waller evil to a nonsensical level. In particular, I don't get her choice to kill off an entire ""B Team"" of heroes. At first we think it was all Blackguard's doing, but then she implies she knew they were going into an ambush. There are so many problems with this scene. First off, why would she put Rick Flag on this team? Second, isn't Mon-gal the female equivalent of Mongul, who's basically stronger than a Kryptonian? Third, it makes it seem like the main team has a little too much plot armor, the fact that they don't get shot a single time while the other guys get taken out almost instantly.

Overall I liked most aspects the movie, and will now begin watching Youtube reviews and giving a thumbs down to anyone who disagrees with me. Because that's how we internet users treat reviews now, let's be real.",oyxaam
h7wt6om,I was starting to think we'd never see another good DC movie. Damn that was great.,oyxaam

h7wxcz3,Sean Gunn as Calendar Man was a fun little cameo.,oyxaam

Sebastian is best boy.",oyxaam
h7wy1sl,"And shout out to James Gunn making Starro so sympathetic. He just wanted to float in space. 

Jarro when?",oyxaam
h7wybhn,"This movie was great but it did kinda suck to see the first team die straight away. It makes sense from a character standpoint of course Waller would use the untrustable, inexperienced, and just general chaotic members as a distraction  for the black ops mission, but i would’ve loved to see more of those characters. Plus Waller herself getting disconnected from the group I felt was also a downside.",oyxaam
h7wyiid,That movie had probably the most correct continuity of all of the DC Universe movies (not counting Nolans Batman movies). And Gunn didnt even tried that. That is definitly someone knowing what people want from comic book movies!,oyxaam
h7wyp90,"Okay, I only have one question (as a Marvel fan) who was the guy in the prison scene with the tattoos on his forehead (I am SURE he is someone I just can't remember who...?)  Also the woman who looked like stained-glass?",oyxaam
h7wyuae,"So, James Gunn’s The Suicide Squad. Easily the most complete movie DC has made in awhile but that was pretty obvious from the second they announced it. I didn’t say best, just complete and really likable to basically anyone that doesn’t mind the gore. 

Across the board, just a really well made movie made from a script that clearly defined the characters and the actors perfectly understood the characters. I’d say the majority of the jokes landed and it was the first time John Cena showed me he could act. 

Also as an aside, I really hated the Taserface joke from GotG2 but the Milton joke felt like the perfect continuation of that. Felt like the spirit of that one but this one really worked. 

I liked it. But it’s still another comic book movie that needed another pass in the editing room though. A 2hr movie squeezed into a 2hr12min movie. I had to pause it halfway in (I feel so dirty watching it at home…) and I was shocked I was only halfway in. It was a little flabby and needed to be *just* a little quicker in an invisible way to tighten it up to really knock it out of the park. It feels like Birds of Prey feels like the only superhero movie (or just a blockbuster in general) that just cut through everything to have a really quick, tight and good movie. 

And it’s still another Suicide Squad movie that kinda wasted the *killer* plot device of having bombs implanted in the necks of a bunch of villains though. *One* Waller bomb in the whole movie and it was in the opening sequence!? They really should’ve had one more team member who survived a little longer and they should’ve been blown up at some point. And have the characters be a bit more villainous. 

Those are my only really minor complaints though. The actors were great and understood the tone. The directing was strong whether it was a personal scene or when it took a hard left turn into a nazi underground lab B-movie. The script did justice to the dregs of the DC universe. I think it needed a bit more action though. They really should’ve had to fight through all the Starro zombies in a Kingsman-church-scene kinda scene. It was kinda there with Bloodsport but it was too quick. 

I hope this isn’t the last of Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn though. She absolutely throws herself at any role, she’s a great stunt actress, she loves the character and knows how to sell *any* line thrown at her. 

The reviews and rotten tomato score make it seem like we might be getting another The Dark Knight but we’re really getting a good blockbuster that gets to take its leash off. Also, I was shocked how it really was a sequel to Suicide Squad from 5 years ago (oh God has it really been 5 years…) instead of a completely detached movie. I wouldn’t say it depends on you watching 1 but that it really lets 1 do the heavy lifting of explaining the setup.  

7.5/10, best jokes: Peacemaker’s bio being the same as Bloodsport, Bloodsport doesn’t smoke, Milton’s eulogy, Harley’s entire section with President Luna and the entire scene of the team tearing through the freedom fighter’s camp",oyxaam
h7wyv82,Femme fatale Harley is by far the best part of the film ♥️♥️,oyxaam
h7wz05x,"Flag asking Nanaue to stay off the comms, Flag and Harley doing that 'don't cough with your mouth open' bit and Harley saying 'oh' to the dictator explaining to her why she was a symbol of resistance got genuine laughs out of me. Se gopd camerawork choice too. Flag and Peacemaker fighting reflected on the helmet was nice.",oyxaam

h7x041k,"I think it’s funny that Weasel, King Shark and Sebastian all survived. Team Animal had no KIA",oyxaam
h7x0gjb,"I love every single member of the B squad. They are really fun characters. I thought Ratcatcher II would be meh, but turns out she's unbelievably wholesome in a squad filled with psychopaths and it just works. She is great in this movie. 

Harley's story was a bit forced. The situation with the president was a bit out there and the torture scene was kinda dumb. I'm guessing it was hard to get her from team A to team B, but the way they did it was quite underwhelming. Still she is great in the movie regardless of whatever weird situation they put her in. 

Team B was definitely fun though. Overall a very entertaining and fun movie. The lows were the Harley stuff in the middle of the movie, but even then it wasn't that bad.",oyxaam
h7x17sp,Didn't expect Bloodsport to basically be more of a protagonist than Harley. Idris Elba absolutely killed it.,oyxaam

I've seen Kimg Shark, Rat catcher and Polka Dot man equally here. Really impressive what Gunn did to get people to like everyone",oyxaam
h7xaa98,"Gunn has this magical ability. Through 90% of the movie he subverts your expectation, makes people extremely unlikable, makes you wonder if you even like them but gives them just enough humanity. Then, 90 minutes into the movie, through some poignant quote, dramatic music, and recurring theme he makes that entire clusterfuck feel heartfelt.",oyxaam
h7xal37,Honestly.  This movie is better than the last one. It has a whole better story and the character had more time/backstory where you can actually like them,oyxaam

h7xfh2m,"Some of my favourite points, to name but a few:

- Starro was actually a really disturbing and scary villain
- Waller was fucking terrifying in how much disregard she had for human life and how brutal she was
- I got genuinely emotional watching Flagg die
- Peacemaker was a fucking bastard who I loved to hate
- Ratcatcher 2, Bloodsport, Harley, Flagg, Nanaue and Polka Dot Man were all done fantastically
- Bloodsports tech was so fucking cool and captured an essence of awesome-to-watch tech that I've not felt since the first two Iron Man movies
- The opening 5 minutes was gory, gruesome and hilarious and was exactly how a suicide squad movie should start

10/10, one of my favourite comic book movies ever",oyxaam

This is one of the most fun movies I've seen in years. I'm so glad they let James Gunn just kind of do his thing with this, it really made me wonder what Guardians of the Galaxy could have been if Disney wasn't tied to it. This is a movie I will watch over and over again for years to come. It really reminded me a lot of Raimi's Spider-Man 2 with just how much it felt like a comic book, from shots looking like frames on a page, right down to some of the dialog and reaction shots.",oyxaam

h7yc94w,"Good movie. Daniela Melchior was an amazing find. I liked all of the main team but Ratcatcher 2 was my favourite character in the movie. I can't imagine it was easy to cast a whole group of actors who were able to make every character likeable but Gunn managed it. In fact, maybe it's just because this is my first time seeing her but I thought Harley was the weakest link. I liked Margot's performance but it seemed like all the other teammates had more interesting motivations. Viola Davis was another standout. She was really good.

One of my only criticisms is that Peter Capaldi was underused. His speech about Starro was really well done. Half Doctor, half Malcolm Tucker. He had a short monologue in the second trailer that I hoped would end up in the movie but it didn't.",oyxaam

Rather than letting Zack Snyder try to cover 10 years of storytelling in two movies so they could catch up with Marvel, they should’ve put in the work. The Suicide Squad is a movie that would be an awesome addition to a proper shared universe. Even that final scene of the original, with Waller and Bruce making thinly veiled threats to one another…imagine how cool this could be if we did have a Suicide Squad and Amanda Waller that existed in a proper cinematic universe occupied by the likes of Superman and Batman. This would have the added bonus of maybe having the Thinker not feel like a character whose entire story happened off screen or make Waller’s downfall feel a bit more interesting. 

Really great standalone movie. But it’s hard not to see some of the potential for what could’ve been if Warners didn’t suck.",oyxaam

The gore is in your face just to be in your face, its not there to serve a meaningful purpose its all style and falls flat. The movie almost feels like a parody of superhero assembles, and if it were filmed and presented that way it would work way better 5/10

As a DC comic fan: oh my lord. Massive disrespect to every single character. Not a single character in this film is representative of the source material.

h7w2epf,"I wrote a post, either not seeing this or hadn't been posted yet. Mods are welcome to delete. Here's what I wrote:

There was no reason to think he wouldn't, and while the critics who saw it reviewed it well, I was still somewhat skeptical. I hated the previous ""Suicide Squad,"" and not a big fan of many of the other DC movies. He pulled it off though and made a thoroughly entertaining DC movie unlike any of the previous. Is the movie perfect? Nah, but I'd say it's somewhere between the quality of Guardians 1 & 2. 

The difference in this movie and where Gunn shines is that you actually give a shit about the characters. You want to know what happens to them, but he's also not afraid to use them, including killing them when needed. You're never certain who is going to be safe, though you have some pretty good guesses. 

I enjoyed the ""false start"" in the beginning, having seen previews and not knowing how so many characters would fit into the plot. Amazingly, this also helped him avoid the curse of having a movie with Jai Courtney. He is absolutely cursed, and you only need to check out his IMDB to verify. It also set the tone of how the violence in the movie was going to play out. There is plenty of blood in this movie, as well as gore, which was very much welcome. I'm glad DC may have taken the cue from movies like Deadpool that superhero audiences aren't squeamish. 

So, what I found was interesting is how this reminded me of another DC property, which is also much different from the rest. The Harley Quinn animated series. I felt this was more in line with that (which is also very good if you haven't seen it). Margot Robbie was pretty much the same in previous movies, but better - less random to just be random, and very much like the character from the cartoon.

The rest of the cast was pretty fantastic too. You should know what to expect from Idris Elba by now and he delivers. John Cena was very enjoyable and at times a standout. I'm really looking forward to his upcoming Peacemaker series now. Ratcatcher 2 played by Daniela Melchior was a nice surprise. I wasn't familiar with her previously, but she gave the movie a lot of heart, with her father being played by Taika Waititi (a nice surprise). The bits with Polka Dot Man and his mother were good, and I think a fan favorite might end up being King Shark played by Sly Stallone. Obviously it has a huge cast and anyone not mentioned is fine. You may wanted to see more of your favorite, but it's already packing in a lot in the little over 2 hour run time.

I saw this streaming, and I might go end up seeing it again in the theater because it simply deserves it. I hope with things like the Delta Variant going around that it doesn't damper the numbers on this movie too much. It's easily as deserving of a big movie take like any other superhero movie, and I want DC to take away positive things from this, no matter how much it takes in. This is a good direction. Some may complain this is too much like Guardians, but I think it's too violent for that comparison. 

The only other complaint I might have were times when the special effects dropped off at the end, but just a little. Mostly it was solid big budget stuff and most people won't notice. 

In the end, if you like James Gunn's previous stuff, there's a good chance you'll like this. If you like things like Super, it may be your favorite superhero movie yet. I'm giving it a 91/100. As a reference, the previous Suicide Squad I would have rated 31/100, being very generous and Birds of Prey a -19/100.",oyxaam

h80b2ym,I’m about an hour in and I’m not digging it. Not gonna lie,oyxaam
h89jsfl,"The movie had its charm, and James Gunn is certainly a talented director, but... it fell flat on me.

* Harley Quinn's plotline could have been eliminated and nothing would change. She was totally unnecessary.  
* No sense of threat from the enemies, and no real complications. What's holding back the ""heroes"" from winning? Apparently, it's just the fact the movie has to last two hours.  
* No consequences. >!They slaughter a camp of freedom fighters, and they still want their help.!< Or >!Waller's stuff betrayed her, and they are not court-martialed.!< Gunn puts twists to suprise the audience, but then the plot is always back on its (predictable) rails. The plot of TSS itself has plot armor.  
* What's the character development? At the beginning, Bloodsport's daughter hates him. Then, at the end, he is of course rehabilitated. And also he was grumpy and at the end he is less grumpy. And he became leader-y. But all in all, it's all rather predictable and by the numbers.  
* Even as a comedy, it did not always make the right choices. Betrayals are generally unfunny, no matter how the director tries to spin it.

I think the appeal of Suicide Squad should have been that of ""working class"" ""heroes"" who also happen to be the scum of the Earth. James Gunn's movies however presents them as elite combatants who are at most mentally troubled, and do little to earn their own moments of glory, since their enemies are pushovers. >!Even Peacemaker got eliminated by a single bullet. He was just a jobber.!<

The movie has an R rating for violence and language, but it doesn't feel like it really pushed any boundary. It was not absurd enough for a comedy, nor thrilling enough for an action movie. It has a few (shallow) twists which might not hold after a second vision.

This movie is TRASH. A big pile of hot flaming fucking garbage.

James Gunn is being called a genius but is certainly not one.

Buckle up cause this is gonna be a long one…

So, first things first. 

Blood sport is a shit copy of deadshot. Black guy that’s good with guns, never misses bla bla bla, has his daughter used as blackmail, becomes the leader and main character bla bla bla… BORING! We have seen that shit once, make up something original.
Idria Elba played his part well but no way in hell can he carry’s this trash movie.
My guy has some of the worst plot armour and weapons I’ve ever seen in my life. Worst than Hawkeye in age of Ultron. He has what seems like infinite bullets in a suit that it’s actually his weapons? He takes parts of his armour and creates weapons with it, nothing is explained, nothing makes sense.
(Yes, I do know him from the comics, in the movie it does not make sense)


John cena’s character is fucking garbage as well, shit costume, shit personality, makes no fucking sense why is in prison tbh, no info about him at all, same as Elba’s character but white bla bla bla. Gunn didn’t even have the balls to kill this idiotic character because reasons I guess.

That’s another one… everyone in this movie is a fucking idiot. EVERYONE.

Harley queen, as always, carries this fucking franchise and Margot’s acting is off the charts. Her character was butchered in some ways but Margot is just simply too good to look bad even in this movie. As always the bad guys miss whenever they shoot at her even if they’re close range and as always Harley kills everyone with a couple of hits even if the enemies have armour.  Her fighting skills are superior to Batman’s apparently and that is a FACT since Batman got stabbed and punched in BVS and so far, we’ve seen Harley fight more enemies than Batman without getting hit at all, so yeah, there’s that…

King shark is basically groot. Contributes NOTHING to the movie.

Sean Gunn is present in the movie
Michael rook is present in the movie
Taika is present in the movie
The polka dot guy was also from marvel…

See where I’m trying to get here? 

Recycled characters, recycled actors, recycled concepts, recycled humour, this movie is literally just a cheap copy of guardians of the galaxy.
Free violence and literally too much gore for absolutely no reason, shitty anticlimactic villain that also didn’t make sense was also recycled from GOTG 2.
The way the starfish is defeated holy fuck was it trash. No city has millions of rats and no way in hell do they kill people by simply touching them. YES THAT IS WHAT WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING AT THE END. 
That big fucking alien star fish that was bullet proof, somehow had his BULLET PROOF EYE pierced by a spear LMAO OMG.
For some reason the same BULLET PROOF starfish alien also kinda struggled with rats climbing on it because FUCKING REASONS THATS WHY.

Amanda Waller got hit in the head by a member of staff?? WHAT THE FUCK? The same person that executed her whole office in the previous movie is turned into a joke in this one.

Harley Quinn didn’t actually enjoy getting tortured? 

Flag got killed because…?

Cleo, that is supposed to be portuguese, had a french accent and a non Portuguese name? Also, in what Portugal did she grew up in that it snowed there??

I don’t remember any other character because they’re not worth remembering.

Same old music, same old stupid jokes, same old villains, same old crap plot that is full of holes…

This movie is not it.
Anyone with 5 grams of brain matter will see that this film is a parody of GOTG, a middle finger to DC and it’s fanbase. 

People talk shit about the first suicide squad but that movie was actually ORIGINAL. This one is not, AT ALL.

Gunn killed off the “original” team members because reasons idk why, who gives a fuck at this point. Captain boomerang died like a fucking idiot, Pete Davidson was cringe, that whole beach scene was weird and stupid as fuck. 

Movies contributes nothing for the DCEU as well as there’s no information whatsoever about anything. No whens just wheres.

Bloodsport put superman in hospital and for some reason that wasn’t shown, because you know… reasons.

Have I mentioned that everyone and their mothers is a fucking idiot in this movie?


Dick jokes HAHAHAHAHAH

Some parts of the movie are really poorly edited/written, like you’ll have characters in one place in one shot and in the next they’re 3 miles away because the plot requires them to even tho it makes no sense unless the flash was offering everyone a ride.

I’m my opinion, you can’t mention Superman  in movies like this because then it makes no sense him not showing up to deal with an urgent threat , if that makes sense? 
Like, an alien the size of fucking Godzilla is killing thousands , why wasn’t superman there?

The plot of the movie is stupid, you get a new antagonist every 2 minutes, nothing makes sense, how come NO ONE in this fucking movies hears gunshots? Just look at both Flag’s and Harley’s recue missions. STUPID.

I could go on and on about plot holes and bad writing but I think I got the major flaws of this GOTG parody. 

This movie is trash and if I could I’d get my money back. IGN can suck a cock, oh my lord I’m fed up with their bullshit reviews.
I genuinely think that people that liked this movie know fucking nothing about cinema.

I could write something better than that shit.

Worst movie of the year. It literally shows you why some people hate Marvel movies because this suicide squad is a fucking marvel movie and it SUCKS. It has nothing to do with DC whatsoever, cinematography and writing wise.

Garbage.
I’ll stop here I promise.

I understand it’s an entire different group that created and acted with this film vs the 2016 film, but why? Is this a sequel or a reboot? Both? They had some of the same exact actors and actresses from the 1st movie playing the same characters, yet it’s being sold as a completely different film. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a great movie on the surface, but when you put any kind of thought into it, it really just doesn’t make sense. And after viewing the first film multiple times, I found myself very indifferent to plot being that I already know what it is for the most part. They sped thru the beginning exposition a lot (knowing ppl are tired of seeing the same story again) which was good but other than the new characters and the comic book tone, i really struggled to see how this was any better than the 1st movie. Like at all. It’s basically a copy and paste just switch out a few characters. It gives me justice league vibes, that’s basically what this is to me.

His body that has all the important organs should have remained unharmed. Assuming he feels the pain of his detached limbs I guess maybe shock could do it?

Cena was a great douchebro Cpt.America.

poor polka-dot man

loved Nanaue...even if he felt like a Groot in cosplay at times.

didnt get Ratcatcher as more that girl on the team for most of the movie.  did think her item was a bit silly in its effectiveness.

poor Milton.

Suddenely Harley Quinn! was very forced i felt,  but then: She is perfect casting and Fan Favourite.  \[so glad they lost the hot pants\]

Pity about Flagg - but then run thru the heart and bled out doesnt mean dead in comic and superhero realities.  also the close smiles with Harley showed he was doomed.  almost as much as him talkign about what he would do after the mission.

most of the first team were meh...

I didnt recognise Nathan Fillion.

Savant was a weird choice, and i do love the casting.

and the weasel from Ice Age?  wtf? \[of course they survived!\]

all in all: i  felt it was two directors with two different views of the movie randomly mixing thier parts for the final version.

Every now and again I still have issues with Gunn's more ""obverse"" style of humour but overall it hit right and the pacing was very nicely done.

h886e02,Honestly that whole scene was awesome. Usually those kinds of scenes in movies are meant to be sickeningly sweet and blah blah blah but this one felt real and showed her acting like an angry teenager.,oyxaam
h88f5s0,Right? It is a great example of generational differences. Also a very small TV would be stupid.,oyxaam
h8aaqg9,"I wonder if that was inspired by an episode of Seinfeld where Jerry bought his dad one of those old electronic organizers and all his dad used it for was calculating tips at restaurants and Jerry would yell, ""It does other things!"".",oyxaam
h8o7cvd,"That was one of my favorite scenes. Idris Elba and Storm Reid yelling ""fuck you!"" at each other was hilarious and also pretty realistic given the circumstances. We didn't need wholesomeness with Bloodsport and his kid, it makes much more sense for his kid to be angry and prone to following a criminal path because of her upbringing.",oyxaam
h8hcj2b,"When that scene started I was worried they were going to give him the same arc as Will Smiths character in the first movie.  
As soon as Idris Elba started swearing I was relieved.",oyxaam
h819pvk,"I actually predicted that line just before she said it, because kids *would* say that.   
But I didn't expect to be right.  That made it even funnier.",oyxaam
h8cyfmh,"It gave me very ""I DON'T KNOW WHAT 'CHEERS' IS"" energy.",oyxaam
hggpwg8,"Great actors, felt just as awkward as watching a real family fight lmao",oyxaam
h893nuh,This is my conversation with my gf when I have to explain why I need the latest phone that comes out lol,oyxaam
hberecx,Funny bc Bloodsport uses all those gadgets as weapons that all do other things!,oyxaam
hbp28hk,He had a good point imagine going to jail over that,oyxaam
hcs56qa,Smart watch fans when I question their expenses,oyxaam
h80aov2,"Surprised more comments aren’t about this. I was really impressed my all the effects in this movie. Wonderful compositing, CG, stunts, etc.   

Only time I could see a bit behind the curtain was when Starfish was in immediate frame with the squad or when Harley was running on the crumbling roof, but it wasn’t distracting or anything.   

Hugely refreshing to see when I feel like every other recent superhero movie (_Marvel_) has underbaked effects and incredibly obvious blue screen considering the budget they’re working with",oyxaam
h89hhk7,"They did the right thing with King Shark, in having him look cartoony. 

At no point did they try to make him look ""real"" and because of that, they could make a great looking cartoony shark man, rather than a mediocre accurate looking shark man. 

It was the same thing with Polka Dot Man's powers. In no way did they make them look or react like real things. But because they made them like stylized Kirby Krackle, it looked really cool and I was never like ""why don't these obey physics?"".",oyxaam
h8ar8q7,"This movie has top-shelf visuals. It was literally eye-candy all the way, I wasn't even bothered it's mostly CGI as I usually do. 

This movie delivers exactly what summer blockbuster should deliver. Pure fun. Kudos to James Gunn for this one!",oyxaam
h8d4gb8,"He looks like he actually has *weight*. That's the biggest problem with bad CGI, the computer generated stuff doesn't interact with the real world and doesn't seem to actually effect the space that it inhabits.",oyxaam
h8k6xuh,"That close up of him hiding under a tarp in the bus was beautiful. I didn’t think “that’s bad CGI”, I thought “awwww”",oyxaam
h8gs09v,"yup, Sebastian the rat the whole time too right in scenes with actors next to their faces",oyxaam
h88lmra,I think this might get a nomination for Best Visual Effects.,oyxaam
h8f25qx,Same with the weasel/ferret - really good CGI with his loopy eyes and crooked walk.,oyxaam
h9mbthf,Fuck that was cgi? I thought they trained a shark.,oyxaam
h8gfp5o,"There was only one scene where the cgi stood out to me, when he has the man's head in his mouth. The head and king shark both looked obviously fake wheras the rest of the movie was mostly spotless.",oyxaam
h8grhqz,Can anyone explain to me what he is exactly? Is he invincible?,oyxaam
h985g0e,"The Suicide Squad movies are really showing some great success at adapting monstrous characters. King Shark, Killer Croc, and Weasel all looked terrific.

The Marvel vs. DC rivalry is largely made up, but the only Marvel character I think comes close is Rocket (and maybe OG Groot). It feels like costuming and character design is something DC is very strong at.",oyxaam
h875q3e,lol yup finally a DCEU movie with good CGI .. King Shark was my favorite character in the trailer and still is after the movie,oyxaam
h8fbdgx,Won’t lie I was worried in the trailers. The closeup when he’s in the bus was amazing.,oyxaam
h846of6,"I knew before the post credits that he was still alive. When the mission was complete, and they showed the bomb switches, his portrait was still lit.",oyxaam
h86gorp,"This is spoilers but man I feel  like Joe Kinnalman last name should be Killaman, but he seems to always dies, but he is awesome. As an actor and reminds me of Jon Berthnal. They need to work together!

  Flag was amazing. Also he was great in S1 AC so I hated it when he left the show and I have only seen 2 episodes.

 Edit like the person below me said. They are menacing. It is just their demeanor I think.

 Imagine being his kid, and he comes home from work. ""Your mother said you played games instead of doing your chores"" as menacing or INTENSE, I would just get up and do them.

 He would just have to look at 10 year old me.",oyxaam
h86nbq6,I wish it were polka dot man.,oyxaam
h8coiv8,"To be fair, I'm pretty sure that scene with Weasel was *supposed* to be the post-credit scene, but then when development of a Peacemaker TV show began and some exec demanded they set that up, things got shifted around.",oyxaam
h7w60h0,That Peacemaker survived when Flagg didn't was a fucking joke. I also kinda wish that the interdimensional virus could've regrown Polka Dot Man.,oyxaam
h82nx1g,Nathan Fillion is too busy with Rookie I'm afraid,oyxaam
h9dl30w,I think I’m the only one who wanted Boomerang to survive!,oyxaam
h88n3gq,"Dude I can't help laughing like an idiot everytime they're on screen.

Edit: wait we mean the Weasel right?",oyxaam
h8zt4oc,I too was hoping for a Polka Dot Man revival.,oyxaam
h8ekhwv,The man who can climb anything?,oyxaam
h8c1fzc,They should have revived Pete Davidson somehow just to piss everyone off lol,oyxaam
h87l6q3,"He'll come back, he always comes back",oyxaam
h8mshlz,Yeah I feel like I've known enough about peacemaker. He's just nuts. I would prefer a show about the rat chick. I'm tired of watching psychos,oyxaam
hcuh5f2,"I was waiting for Boomerang to get brought back somehow all movie. Now they'll need to shove a resurrections plot line into a future movie.

As silly as it sounds, Boomerang is too important to kill off in a bit roll like this. Literally my only problem with the movie, but as a huge Flash fan, it's kinda a big one.",oyxaam
h89pzdy,"Me too. Should have been Rick Flag. They actually give him character development, for what? PeaceMaker has no character development and is used horribly.",oyxaam
h9exl32,Can’t kill what you can’t see,oyxaam
hggpx5i,Which one?,oyxaam
homt1ny,Happy Cake Day! :),oyxaam
h7xub4h,*martyr,oyxaam
h856sau,GET ON A SATELLITE DALE YOU DUMB DICKHEAD!,oyxaam
h8198v6,Genuinely saved the entire country with an act of insubordination.,oyxaam
h8eqtb8,She is a hero who made a huge mistake. Leaving Waller alive means that half of that behind the scenes team is going to find themselves dead in awful ways. And it doesn't change/fix things going forward.,oyxaam
h83n9bn,"I know DC wouldn't be brave enough to allow it, but I really was hoping the tech with the glasses who was off-put by Weller threatening kids would shoot her in the head out of nowhere as she reached to detonate the bombs. Would have been poetic for a puppeteer like Weller to get killed by some beneath-her-notice underling like that.",oyxaam
h8kgi28,It's also kinda poetic justice considering walker murdered her  underlings in the first movie,oyxaam
h8msndm,Its sad that in real life this never happens. Or that person would go immediately to jail forever,oyxaam
h8l3y72,"The woman who hits her says its for the kids 

Maybe they knew weisel couldn't swim to make him suffer longer while dying to make him pay for those 27 children?",oyxaam
h9p0f0x,I really disliked how aggro Waller was in this. Like she was definitely an Alpha who was in control in the first movie but this one they really wanted to make her a villain. But having her scream her head off in the operations control room at people- especially Savant at the beginning when the dude is like having War PTSD flashbacks just left a bad taste. It wasn't funny it was just sickening.,oyxaam
hafwxqn,"meh, The Wall doesn't get knocked out. I thought that scene was dumb, even though it needed to happen because they set the suicide squad's most modern incarnations as scrappy, goofy, and somewhat incompetent misfits rather than a group of professionals forced to do a job (think the Task Force X ep of JLU).",oyxaam
hggq4us,"She was bloody amazing I was cheering out loud for her fuck yeah haha and the adrenaline after you could see she was still on, freaking amazing acting absolutely brilliant, this film gets a 9/10 from me would've been better without the needless sex/romance but man when Harley killed him made up for it amazingly",oyxaam
h80dyeb,The amount of heart in that one scene was enough to fill a Pixar movie.,oyxaam
h9lv2x9,I did NOT go into this movie expecting to cry....like wtf,oyxaam
hatz6th,I thought something was wrong with me.  That scene hit me so hard.  Glad I wasn't the only one.,oyxaam
h8lv35d,He is a master of storytelling and anything to do with movies and comedy. I love everything he does.,oyxaam
h8tdgyl,"OH, SHIT, THAT WAS TAIKA WAITITI??? I completely forgot he was in this movie lmfao",oyxaam
hggq5p7,Ah I knew that dude looked familiar but wasn't super sure,oyxaam
h80n73p,He’s the guy Harvey Dent threatens in the tunnel in The Dark Knight.,oyxaam
h80n5x0,"I mean he did say that his virus was ""inter-dimensional"" so i wouldn't be surprised if the impact from starro caused some kind of viral reaction that caused him to go somewhere else. maybe its just wishful thinking but hey, we never saw his full dead body.",oyxaam
h87hyna,His character in Prisoners is so deeply unsettling and Dastmalchian completely sells you on him.,oyxaam
h7xdccx,"Right? He's great in everything I've seen him in, and I'm sure he'll be in Ant-Man: Quantumania",oyxaam
h89hn5d,"I distinctly remember when The Dark Knight came out being intrigued by him so much from his one scene to look him up on IMDB to see what else he'd been in, and being disappointed to see that he *hadn't* been in anything else. Glad that's changed.",oyxaam
h8okp0h,"""I'm a motherfucking superheroooooooo"" was my favorite line I think, he delivered it perfectly",oyxaam
h8mw9j3,"He’s great at maxxing out screentime.

Pieter de Vries is going to RULE in dune. Sociopathic drug addict human computer who wants the main character’s mother as a prize. Like holy shit that’s written for him.",oyxaam
h8l6zbm,Reminded me a Buster Bluth that somehow turned into a supervillian.,oyxaam
h8dqoiw,He has excelled in every acting role I've seen him in.,oyxaam
h8g1n0b,"I was secretly hoping they'd somehow tie this in with the character he played in The Dark Knight, since it's also a DC movie",oyxaam
h8mkqpj,"I watched all of MacGyver with my dad and was so happy when he was cast in this film. Such a step up from a recurring CBS TV show character. You should check out his scenes from the show though, very well acted. He's so good",oyxaam
h98augi,I'm just now aware that wasn't Paul Dano,oyxaam
h7wh4dn,"seriously, the most amazing mom issues I have ever seen...",oyxaam
h87y0w9,Noticed when he goes into the girls locker room at the gentleman’s club and sees the naked girls he shrieks “oh god!” He definitely was seeing his mom naked. Lol,oyxaam
h850wpa,The shot of him dancing with all his moms is just... thank you Gunn.,oyxaam
h83ewot,Seriously I think peacemaker calling him Norman bates was to tame,oyxaam
h8adrvw,"""Where is your mother now?""

*Haunted look.* ""Everywhere.""",oyxaam
h832nw4,I was sad to see him go,oyxaam
h8ctvjb,I felt so bad he finally became a superhero to just…,oyxaam
h84ipep,"That bit throughout the film was so James Gunn, it was amazing.",oyxaam
h82b9dh,"And he's wearing a plugsuit, we finally got the live-action Evangelion adaptation we didn't know we needed",oyxaam
h826n73,"as someone with a horrible abusive mother, I absolutely related to those scenes and felt validated and recognized",oyxaam
h8ebujh,He is a tragic fuck-up and almost redeemed himself.,oyxaam
h8b54hw,Reminded me of Aphex Twins music videos,oyxaam
h83gqgh,"The way it was manifested on screen is really something else.

Lovely, lovely stuff.",oyxaam
h8gwl30,I never expected his mom to look like a Karen,oyxaam
h88o461,I love him. I'm reminded of the ending of Uncut Gems where spoilers ---------------- Adam Sandler get clapped right at his height emotionally.,oyxaam
h83g34s,Very interesting character - one of the more compelling characters in film,oyxaam
hc5h32e,Somebody on Reddit has already posted a picture of Sebastian the Rat also looks like his mother with little glasses. Its the scene in which he tell the squad he sees his mother everywhere and sees them all as his mother(s?).,oyxaam
hggq87w,"Yeah that was fucking fucked up, dude needs therapy. I wonder if anyone irl has something similar in their pov ??? Considering hallucinating schizophrenic symptoms perhaps yes irl has it too lol how fascinating",oyxaam

hdz6f1o,"I was racing up on a handful of mushrooms, I was sitting there, shirtless, in a hot room, my eyes rolling around in my head, and then they pan to The Weasel and it's like I'm staring at my my inner self. 

I had to pause the movie because I was laughing so damn hard at that weasle.",oyxaam
h83atlj,SAME,oyxaam
h7vyyc9,Slipped in like buttah hehe,oyxaam
h7vzrtx,I think he was injured which makes it so much worse.,oyxaam
h7wvmle,I cried laughing at that.  ..and then the flopping dick guy; hysterical.,oyxaam
h7x98u4,I hope he continues to be a violent piece of shit in his HBO max series. He was a real douchebag in the movie but he's so fun to watch.,oyxaam
h7yc21o,And then killing the woman doing laundry 2 seconds later. No hesitation.,oyxaam
h7zkno5,Cant believe they killed the freedom fighters,oyxaam
h7w8dqc,He diced him like an onion lol,oyxaam
h7z8vxc,"""Nobody likes a showoff.""",oyxaam
h80425x,"The way he did it so casually...

Peacemaker - making killing fun.",oyxaam
h81riz8,"Not a fun death, certainly. 

How the fuck about getting ripped in half vertically? Jesus Christ what a horrible last few seconds of your life that would be.",oyxaam
h7xr9y7,god that's so funny it was the rebels too after all that,oyxaam
h7w236y,It took me until the second or third stab to realize what was happening and I started laughing way too hard and the girl I was with didn't like my reaction too much.,oyxaam
h7whhyp,"It’s worse, he wasn’t stabbing.. he was chopping him up with the axe lmfao",oyxaam
h7wujy0,Not to mention they were all revealed to be good guys lol,oyxaam
h7w3tko,that shit was hysterical. definitely the funniest “kill” I’ve ever seen in an action movie lmaoooo,oyxaam
h7w82ej,XD It was so Looney Tunes like but violent.,oyxaam
h7x7b10,And he was a freedom fighter.,oyxaam
h82t09v,"The rare walk-by hatcheting. I feel like robin Williams is smiling somewhere, he liked his dark humor as well and it reminded me of a ""drive-by fruiting"" I can't possibly be the only",oyxaam
h88ifpb,"Moment I saw Rick I was like ""Oh shit, all those people who were just sleeping, eating, bathing etc...""",oyxaam
h86lovu,The scene of him just randomly in tighty-whities was hilarious too.,oyxaam
h85q2fa,And then finding out that everybody in that camp was a freedom fighter,oyxaam
h87nvwq,"One of the funniest scenes in the movie. I choked laughing and yelled ""why???""",oyxaam
h83k7t8,I shouldn’t have cracked up at something like that but I *definitely* did,oyxaam
h83p2ut,Lol yeah chopped that dude right up,oyxaam
h84fcnb,"Brutal AF 😳 sadistic infact, but nevertheless brilliant",oyxaam
h7z1igl,"I loved this scene so damn much. However, not to bring down the room buy this is once hpw my uncle described some of the stuff he had to do in Vietnam. Get in there and get them while they are sleeping. 

That was 100% what I pictured in my mind when he finally told me war stories around a camp fire.",oyxaam
h84rypb,uh-uh-uh-uh-uuuuhhggggg.... I fuckin died too LMAO,oyxaam
hdz6n1f,"Right? That scene perfectly telegraphs the pending comedy..  ""Oh yeah there's NO WAY these are the bad guys. LOL!""",oyxaam
h7xa4ab,He was actually hacking him with his axe/hatchet.,oyxaam
h7z3uwe,When you have coup d'etat as a bonus action.,oyxaam
h8bf6fw,It was funny to imagine him waking up to that thouhh,oyxaam
h81uge0,Wasn't that an axe?,oyxaam
h7xi28w,You mean Pissmaker?,oyxaam
hggqayi,"Yeah like wow damn cold hearted for real, peacemaker my ass lol",oyxaam
h7zgepl,Crazy thing is he's smaller than when he was wrestling,oyxaam
h7xeeqa,"No joke. He made Joel Kinnaman look small, and that guy seemed like a giant in every scene of Altered Carbon.",oyxaam
h80icz4,Looks like he has parasites in his arms tho,oyxaam
h80i855,Needed more of those tighty whitey scenes.,oyxaam
h83aoq2,Look up pictures and realize John Cena and John Oliver are the exact same age,oyxaam

h832iz8,Man wears a headband as an armband,oyxaam
h84kgfc,"https://youtu.be/0A5DGHqvJ6c
Watch this from about a minute thirty. Cena’s massive.",oyxaam
h8j6bgc,The scene where he's just in his underwear it struck me so hard that he straight up looks like a standard World of Warcraft human,oyxaam
h85zn2w,Cena was a nice surprise. He held his own with Elba from an acting standpoint.,oyxaam
h892x43,His arms were so comic book absurd it was great,oyxaam
h856097,"He's been jacked for 20 years, and he's looking better than ever.",oyxaam
h8970l3,With that much muscle you think he’d pursue a career in wrestling,oyxaam
h85jmv1,"In all honesty, I think he looks better now than he did while he was wrestling 🤷🏻‍♂️",oyxaam
h84h38g,Him in those whitey tighties 👀,oyxaam
h89aavf,"He gave me almost Arnold vibes here, and I loved his deadpan delivery. I hope he gets more roles off the back of this.",oyxaam
h80ksa0,"He's a Hollywood actor in an action movie, he probably works out like crazy before filming and takes hella roids and HGH and shit",oyxaam
h8wxnqm,His arms are so big when he wrestlers he uses headbands instead of arm bands on his biceps.,oyxaam
hggqbj6,And I am so jelly,oyxaam
h80lyy3,I thought the Rock and Bautista were huge.... Cena looked  unreal at times.. There had to be some CGI muscles on him.,oyxaam
h88iwqg,You know he's a wrestler right?,oyxaam
h7wimqi,I liked that another bird got the last laugh with Savant.,oyxaam
h7wxdi5,That scene was a rough watch. I'm a bird lover and have a little conure. I'm glad I put him to bed before watching this. Those birdie screams made me sad. 😢,oyxaam
h84a4q0,I'm just happy the rat survived.,oyxaam
h7ylxdp,"Birds felt like a really heavy theme throughout the movie. 

That opening bit with Savant 
The bird eating him
Luna’s birds 
I think he refers to Harley as a bird at some point?
The starfish look and even sound like birds when they come out of Starro towards the end",oyxaam
h7y9s8c,That was one of the saddest deaths in the movie,oyxaam
h7wrpme,I did too but when the actual gore and death happened for the characters I was laughing away. I guess I just really liked that cute little bird,oyxaam
h7xd125,"I straight up said to my partner, ""what does James Gunn have against birds?!""",oyxaam
h82s9at,It's a nice callback to the comics since that bird is a canary and Savant has a bad history with Black Canary in the comics.,oyxaam
h815kqy,Gunn hates birds confirmed...unless they are animated in a kill montage.,oyxaam
h86nalp,I own pet rats. Cute animals wise I was extremely satisfied with that movie. It was like my lityle babies saved the day,oyxaam

h7vyrg3,"Imagine how I felt when the weasel died, only to find out that it lives all the way at the end!",oyxaam

h7wod6k,Bruh when he fell from that building i that he was gonna splat.,oyxaam
h7vz00x,He was the only one i needed to make it out alive,oyxaam
h7vyp64,He was the Groot of this movie. I thought we'd lose him for sure.,oyxaam
h7wv5xj,"Dude's invulnerable. The only time I was worried was when Starro was about to go all hentai on him, but once he was thrown through a building, I knew he'd be fine.

Speaking of which, I thought it was bullshit that his skin's impervious to Bloodsport's hi-tech weaponry, but those weird, alien fishies were able to sink their teeth into him.",oyxaam
h7w7nva,I thought those fish monsters things got him and I was fixing to be pissed.,oyxaam
h7xihi0,The only time I was concerned he might die was when those alien fish things started taking chunks out of him. When the building was falling I was like oh thank God it's just a building he'll be fine.,oyxaam
h7x1ihd,Hand :D,oyxaam
h804kpe,"Nanaue is so freaking cute!!!! 


I squeal a little every time he's on screen! I hope to see more of him, Sly is perfect as him. I knew Harley was 100% not in danger, so all my attention is on Nanaue. I can't take it if he dies.",oyxaam
h7vz6fp,I was totally prepared for him and Sebastian to eat it and I was totally prepared to be very upset.,oyxaam
h7ye3hy,He bled a lot when the Ponyo piranhas attacked him,oyxaam

h7xtcxw,"I knew from promo stuff he would live long enough to swing on Starro's arm, but after that I had no idea what would happen",oyxaam
h7xuz6l,Remember when they played us all and called him King shark in the trailer and even had him refer to himself as King shark only to never use that name once,oyxaam
h80fqa4,"Same. My husband and I yelled ""no!"" when Starro got hold of him...",oyxaam
h7x0o9q,The only thing I cared about,oyxaam
h808u81,"Well, Nanaue took on an incredible amount damage and lived.  Thinking me might be the descendant of a shark god.",oyxaam
h848ztc,I think this is a good time to introduce Orca in The Suicide Squad 2.,oyxaam
h84stti,After Flagg I was terrified.,oyxaam
h85rsax,He cries during the movie :(,oyxaam
h88zp3d,"I honestly was hesitant that he was going to kill one of the main members at some point. I liked him but I’m with you, constant anxiety on whether he’ll die or eat someone lol",oyxaam
h7wex0u,"for real, especially during the tower scenes.",oyxaam
h820bo8,Nom nom?,oyxaam
h83g5ln,Yeah that piranha attack scene with pool of blood was a nice fake out,oyxaam
h8oqu6n,Does anyone else feel like it should have been the Rock voicing him instead of Stallone? I mean the Rock has both the heritage and precedent (he ALSO played a demigod who turned into a shark...).,oyxaam
h7ysu30,He is definitely a tank in this party.,oyxaam
h82m9a3,Dude seriously. My boy was MVP in this movie. I just wanted someone to give him a hug.,oyxaam
h87q0gj,Ditto. He (and Sebastian) stole my heart.,oyxaam
h90w1nw,Bro I did a loud NO in the theater when the building was gonna fall on homeboy. I was verge of tears and my bf was like he too cute to die. Don’t worry they gotta make merch out of him he’ll live.,oyxaam
hggqc13,Pftttt lol,oyxaam
h7w2s1c,The whole building scene I was wondering why that random dude who was driving them was still following them around.  The pay off was totally worth it.,oyxaam
h7vyznt,Who's Milton?,oyxaam
h7xx08x,"While Milton's death is funny and dark, seeing Polka-Dot Man being genuinely concerned and mourning for him

h7w074m,Wym. He survived. He was blackmailing Waller at the end!,oyxaam
h7zr7jf,Seeing him next to them during the cool ass white wide angle shot made me laugh. I thought he'd become one of the Squad by default somehow. Then he just got swiss cheesed.,oyxaam

h80o18b,I was worried about him from the start. I knew he would be in the walking through the rain scene so I figured he was doomed. But at least someone cared about him,oyxaam
h8294bp,What do you mean? He blackmailed Waller and became a hero to his daughter?,oyxaam

When you first realized they just slaughtered a camp of good guys gave me the same kind of hilarious face palm moment as when in MacGruber >!where he assembles his team and then they all blow up in the van!<

I guess that 's also the first part of this movie as well >!but like way higher budget in this than in macgruber!<.",oyxaam

It was really awesome!",oyxaam

h7wk4f3,unironcly tho when he died i thought “oh no rick flag” and i never thought i would be emotionally attached to that character,oyxaam

Probably nothing.",oyxaam
h8hqavn,"I figured he wouldn’t make it, or if he did Waller would have made sure he died another way. She clearly set up team 1 to all die on the beach as a distraction to get team 2 in, so she didn’t care if Flagg lived.

We've had Ocean Master and Black Manta translated perfectly to film, fucking MISTER MIND was in SHAZAM! Starro is in this.

We're seeing it a little bit at Marvel in their recent shows, but they need to take a page from DC and just be everything a comic adaptation can be. All the crazy powers, weird characters, and outlandish costumes you can shake a stick at. The audience is here for it.",oyxaam

h813pv7,"That's one of the most interesting parts. He's such a goofy villain, but he was horrific in this. His line about enjoying seeing the cosmos -- he didn't want to be a test subject on earth. Seems like he adapapted violence as a way to take over and take revenge on this planet.",oyxaam

Kind of a trend in the movie though. Most people in the Suicide Squad (at least team B) are shown to be victims in a way. 

Bloodsport and Peacemaker both groomed to be mercenaries from the day they were born. Harley a victim of Joker, and similar nutcases after that. Ratchatcher 2 growing up as a homeless kid with a junkie father. Polka Dot Man was given an interdimensional virus by his insane mom.",oyxaam
h81alxr,I kinda wish they upped the creep/Lovecraftian factor of it. The initial dungeon scene where all the humans were babbling in unison was so good and horrifying.,oyxaam

h86fb4r,And his ambitions are so  modest. He's going to take the city and then things will be square as far as Staro is concerned.,oyxaam
h88m8sv,"he was just vibing, then got captured and tortured for 30 years. Annihilating a city in recompense was a little extra, true, but given the sum total of its experiences with humans up till that point it seems reasonable to take precautions.",oyxaam
h7x6vun,"I mean it didn't *have* to try and take over the city. Pretty sure it's first line was ""This city is mine""",oyxaam
h8072k4,Going in I thought maybe it was going to end like that one episode of Batman Beyond with Starro where they find it a new home.,oyxaam
h8i06ez,"Yeah I love that. A simple line that doesn't undo the movie or make you rethink things too hard, but just adds some great moral color.",oyxaam
h7zqds0,"You fucked up my shit, I’m fucking up your shit",oyxaam
h8qyrbj,"Nah, I love Starro but we know exactly what he was going to do when he touched down on earth. Can't blame a scorpion for stinging baby!",oyxaam
h7zrk1g,"And it recontextualizes the words of the people that were trapped earlier, asking to be freed and saying that the Thinker ""had his way with them"". They were dead already, that was Starro talking.",oyxaam
h812yax,Caught me so off guard,oyxaam
h875oyg,Lol I wonder if superhero’s feel bad for them,oyxaam
h8jqyk2,Made me teared up a bit. Damn.,oyxaam
hggqob9,"I was so fucking sad at that line like geeze, what a way to instantly make you feel sympathetic for the massive starfish killing the citizens",oyxaam
h7wcwpn,You were basically recreating what the people at the base were doing with the b-team,oyxaam
h82cnmb,Dude same story to a T. For me and my friends. I bet Pete and thought I lost until the end.,oyxaam
h85izxt,"I guessed Weasel at first but quickly said “no, that’s too obvious…” Deep down I knew it was going to be a bunch of them dying but I just wanted to see more of all of them.",oyxaam
h7vzvzu,We can rest easy knowing he got what he wanted in the end,oyxaam
h7w1kkk,Was surprisingly bummed about him and Flag but I guess that was the point.,oyxaam
h7wcheu,He's infected with an inter dimensional disease. Am sure he'll survive being squashed in one dimension,oyxaam
h7xauqv,This leaves the door open for Condiment King to join the team,oyxaam
h7xjp52,"Seeing Ratcatcher II crying over his uniform tugged my heartstrings, man...",oyxaam
h7waao8,"I remember watching the trailers, hearing his ""I'm a superhero!"" line and thinking wouldn't it be funny if he died immediately after saying that. Never thought they would actually do it turns out I was wrong.",oyxaam
h7wi8py,I was sad they hit him with the abrupt jokey kill like that. Polka Dot Man deserved better and so did Milton.,oyxaam
h7xh829,That shit where everyone turned into his mom....holy crap was that funny.,oyxaam
h7x1fp3,His death was super unnecessary...,oyxaam
h7whsvh,"His death felt a bit wasted to me. One of my few complaints. It's there for shock value and a bit of a joke but it just doesn't land because he's become more then a joke character by then and they immediately solve the starro problem right after, so killing him just felt a bit mean spirited in what was a surprisingly kind hearted film.",oyxaam
h7wcclk,I called it a few weeks ago; saying that when he proclaimed he was a super hero was moments before his death. I'm sad I was right.,oyxaam
h7wcbu9,"I said that to my friends, but also that dude died right after the happiest moment of his life. It would probably be all downhill from there, so at least he got to go at his absolute happiest.",oyxaam
h7wicvj,The actor brings a lot of the same energy in Happy! which is pretty worth watching,oyxaam
h7w1pua,You never know. Flashpoint can reset everything and his mom worked at Star Labs. There’s lots of ways to bring him back.,oyxaam
h81ftj5,"Going into the movie, I thought it was a toss up between Polka Dot Man and King Shark  on who would have the power to take down Starro.  But it was the damn Pied piper.",oyxaam
h7wmxqs,At least we know he has super powered siblings wandering the DCEU,oyxaam
h80yj7h,Really upset with his death and Rick Flags. I wish Captain Boomerang wasn’t dead either. Would’ve liked to see him take the flash one day.,oyxaam
h7wgzod,"Leading up to this movie release, everyone was betting Polkadot Man died pretty early one. In my opinion, he was by far the most powerful of them, and Gunn did a wonder job leading you on with his possible survival. I've said it a few times on this post already, this was perfection.",oyxaam
h7wwmpb,"I felt like he was doomed, but when he started yelling how he was a super hero I knew it was imminent",oyxaam
h7xwmsn,He survived much longer than I expected going in.,oyxaam
h7xebtg,He got exactly what he wanted and for some reason that moved me.,oyxaam
h7yykbf,"When I first saw the trailer and he delivered the ""I'm a superhero!"" line I knew he was dying 10 seconds later based on Gunn's sense of humor.",oyxaam
h7wb7tb,Maybe he has an identical twin brother? The one that didn’t die in the experiments by mom?,oyxaam
h7wuivi,"They had to kill him because he could've destroyed Starro on his own, then we wouldn't have the fan favourite ""Rats"" save the day.",oyxaam
h7xld9l,"Yeah, he was the only one I was sad for. I was hoping his dimensional powers might have somehow saved him.",oyxaam
h7yv0ko,"Im really upset Abner was killed off, it ruined the movie for me!",oyxaam
h80bq7l,He was to overpowered. It was almost dumb that he didnt kill Starro immediately. And they were planting bombs but they could have just used him on the entire building.,oyxaam
h882wlb,I thought that scene would have been funnier if the tentacle came up and it had actually just missed him.,oyxaam
h82mg2x,"Look to be honest, I see where you're coming from...but he died the happiest he was ever going to be. He probably would have been more sad had he lived.",oyxaam
h837ia4,"Yeah in the old Batman version each colour dot has different properties and he uses them tactically, so I felt they squandered him a bit, just 'generic blaster' if a bit more powerful than the rest (who are mostly 'dude with gun') and only does anything... 3, 4 times? Even the swelling/venting bit was set up and didn't go anywhere?",oyxaam
h86mhqs,I mean considering he mentions brothers and sisters that possibly survived it may not be the end of the Polka Dot mantle.,oyxaam
h88kuvn,he was too pure for this world.,oyxaam
h88tx3q,I feel like they just killed him because he is too powerful. They needed Harley to save the day.,oyxaam
h807nfl,"I felt like his death as well was a set up for a predictable, dumb joke.",oyxaam
h7wevgc,Was really expecting his mom to be a scientist at the lab.  A shame he'll never get the closure he needed.,oyxaam
h7wp580,Wish it had a Heaven sequence with God and naked angels looking like his mother,oyxaam
h7xko97,"You know what? I agree.. I kind of want both an origin and a conclusion to his powers. Could still do it, that's an extra dimensional virus, right? Maybe he got squished right into the dimension where the polka dots come from!",oyxaam
h7x1uc2,"I thought maybe he polka dotted the tentacles and was alive, that his death was a fake out. Sad it wasn’t",oyxaam
h7yvmza,No one really dies in comic books. They can always find a way to bring in him back.,oyxaam
h80osat,Kite Man should be the next loser villain to make it on the big screen. Hell yeah!,oyxaam
h80qhgt,If he’s popular enough they can figure a way to bring him back,oyxaam
h812l7y,The bits about his mom were so good,oyxaam
h816d4t,"I honestly kinda thought he was going to save the entire story with his powers, since they brought it up like 3 times. When he wasn’t bloating with it towards the end, I sadly figured he was going to die.",oyxaam
h83b6rj,"I was fine with him dying but I wish that as he died, it would have released a massive wave of polkadots that consumed the fuck out of Starro, crippling it more than the rats and saving them more for when Harley leaps into its eye and the rats follow.",oyxaam
h84bjkd,"We never saw the body. In my head canon he did a last minute involuntary teleport to the alternate polka dimension and he still lives on.

He needs his own spin-off. Imagine a romcom when he keeps imagining his mom everywhere lol",oyxaam
h84c4u5,"No reason he can't come back. It's comic books, after all.",oyxaam
h86gj2z,"Yeah, he would have been nice to see him in more movies. But at least the rat didn't die.",oyxaam
h87r3bw,"I was so sure that Polka was going to kill the monster by refusing to do his twice-daily polka-barf and allowing the virus to begin eating him alive right as he jumps onto/into the monster, the virus also talking it with him.",oyxaam
h88qaz6,We all called it,oyxaam
h89hs72,He could always be thrown into a Lazarus Pit and come back.,oyxaam
h7wizq5,He went out with such a great line. “Peacemaker…what a fucking joke.”,oyxaam
h7w4lff,R.I.P. the beautiful monster between Luna’s legs - Harley Quinn,oyxaam
h7xhs0v,Fuck Peacemaker tho. He's like the governments ideal Captain America,oyxaam
h7wmv3i,[deleted],oyxaam
h7wupzs,One of the worst characters in the last movie somehow gets the most tragic death in this one. Crazy how much a good script changes things.,oyxaam
h7wboca,RIP Flag.,oyxaam
h7y3j2o,"I wasn't expecting Flag to die and his death hurts the most. I loved Joel Kinnaman's performance as Rick Flag in this film over the 2016 film, seeing Flag be like his comic counterpart but also a maverick in his own right and have sweet bonding moments with Team B. For one of the most tragic deaths out of the characters in the film, he died trying to do the right thing.",oyxaam
h7zo3vz,I honestly thought Flag would be in a hospital bed across from Peacemaker at the end.,oyxaam
h809a60,"He's dead for now. He ""died"" in the comics too.  I wouldn't be surprised to see him back at some point in the future, but who knows.  Unless they plan on replacing him with Bloodsport, which would be fine with me.",oyxaam
h81xuid,"Man, great job from Gunn in making us care for the guy",oyxaam
h857ky6,"RIP his back, which Katana did not have",oyxaam
h82matn,Did you watch passed the end credits?,oyxaam
h88tokz,Folded Flag,oyxaam
h9p13g2,Yeah he was less of a douchebag in this movie. The fact that he wanted to actually take that incriminating info and expose the people at the top even though it goes against his direction made him more human.,oyxaam
h9q93s5,"Didn't expect Takeshi Kovacs, my hero to go like that",oyxaam
h7vxwdk,His arms slapping at the annoyed soldiers was hilarious.,oyxaam
h7wnugt,I can’t believe that was Nathan Fillion.,oyxaam
h7wpedf,I mean he was listed as critical last we saw so maybe not? Still funny though,oyxaam
h7w446x,"Hilarious when his arms get shot at and TDK is in the background, armless, just flailing around lol",oyxaam
h80hzt4,I honestly thought he'd do something cool like grab their guns and start firing them or silently knifing them from behind. But nah arm slaps for everyone lmao,oyxaam
h83zx4q,I actually thought it was the most horrifying in the film. Something about him writhing and screaming as his arms were shot up. And he was so useless there was no reason for him to be there. It was incredibly sad.,oyxaam
h7vymp6,Such a great juxtaposition after showing Mongal burning to death crawling from the helicopter wreckage.,oyxaam
h7w1017,man Waller really looked at his sheet and was like “yeah that’s an easy sacrifice”,oyxaam
h7ysslp,"Is he confirmed dead? I know the last shot of him I thought it said “critical condition” on the screen. I’d love if it be survived, got mechanical bad ass replacement arms, and then still dies immediately in the next one.",oyxaam
h7xylhv,Harley Quinn's reaction to it....I was crying🤣,oyxaam
h84d0lj,"To be fair, we never actually saw TDK dead.  I’m hoping he comes back because his character is inherently hilarious and I love Nathan Fillion.",oyxaam
h814jxq,"The way he was just writhing around with his floating arms getting shot to pieces had me and my family dying.

I went in pretty blind and I couldn’t believe we had gotten live action Arm-Falls-Off Boy.",oyxaam
h80lf14,He has one of the most lamest powers ever but yet he's so proud of trying to help out. RIP The Detachable Kid.,oyxaam
h813jg3,Didn't he live??,oyxaam
h81n1dd,"Same. I was expecting him wielding weapons like dual pistols and swords which would be cool with his flying arms. But nope,  he just slaps. xD",oyxaam
h7wipnv,So was he,oyxaam
h86n0na,You wonder if TDK is actually dead? Only his arms got shot. Maybe they’ll give him bionic arms.,oyxaam
h88ahjb,Had him rolling too!,oyxaam
h8dw4as,Uh he didn't die. At no point does it say he died. He's in critical condition.,oyxaam
h7ypcna,"Is ""had me rolling"" an SD joke I missed? So many using it in this thread",oyxaam
h83gavd,A fitting comedic death for an asinine useless character,oyxaam
h83n2yk,Had no idea it was Nathan Fillion at first,oyxaam
h9p1aw1,"Me too, I think my gf missed what was happening in the chaos but when they were just shooting his floating arms and they cut to him screaming and flailing around on the ground fucking had me dying.  

Mon-Gal too, when she just jumped on to the Helicopter and proceeds to scream while it spins out of control and crashes was so funny to me.",oyxaam
ha1d0zt,"funny, it had him rolling too",oyxaam
hggqpjb,His entire skill had me fucking dying of laughter hahah,oyxaam
i1z9owa,James Gunn confirmed he’s still alive,oyxaam
h7vzp0z,I knew a lot of this cast wasn’t going to outlast the first 20 minutes. I didn’t realize this would mean Pete getting his fucking face blown away like that lol,oyxaam
h7vxbog,i always seem to walk into this bit doing a screen check and everytime it makes me laugh seeing the audience's faces.,oyxaam
h7w51ga,"I'm sure I'm not the only one, but I predicted he would die first.",oyxaam
h7w0kp2,"I don’t even hate him but that was so satisfying to see. Also, he lasts like 9 minutes lol",oyxaam
h7ynzw3,"I was a little bummed because, in the comics, Blackguard’s real name is Richard Hertz, and there’s a joke (in Justice League International) about his name being “Dick Hurts”. I figured, given the fact that they cast someone like Pete Davidson, they’d slip that joke in there.",oyxaam
h7xazsz,His line with the Weasel on the plane had me rolling,oyxaam
h89xdqs,"Pete Davidson haters: ""Fuck yeah, they killed Pete!""

Pete Davidson fans: ""Fuck yeah, they killed Pete!""",oyxaam
h7ygjni,"I pretend I hate him, but he does have a little charisma",oyxaam
h82y8y7,"It's like Gunn saw how they botched the ""shocking"" death of Slipknot in the first one, and decided to do it right for an entire squad. You get all this character building and anticipation to see how this group of knuckleheads are going to pull this off and they all immediately and horrifically shit the bed.",oyxaam
h7wms8t,Credittor to the redditor that called it that he would be killed in first several minutes given how little time it seemed he took off SNL for filming this specifically,oyxaam
h7ynmpp,It was so weird to have a DC movie give me exactly what I wanted right up front like that.,oyxaam
h80g0co,"He got to bang Kate Beckinsale.  I don't hate him, I'm just really jealous.",oyxaam
h7wj03b,Phoebe Dynevor fans will definitely have a big grin on their faces watching this.,oyxaam
h7y5644,Face off,oyxaam
h7xf8vk,Why would you hate Pete Davidson. The King of Staten Island was amazing,oyxaam
h7w5kc4,This kind of Pete Davidson cameo boasts any movie by at least a star,oyxaam
h80gb4x,"Anyone else think in the beginning that Sevant was seeing like a flash of the future? And then it would have showed him back in the cell like, “no motherphuckers.”",oyxaam
h88sr5q,"I originally didn't like Pete Davidson but for some reason YouTube kept recommending his videos. He slowly won me over. He's very self depreciating, has some killer bits on SNL and has a tragic upbringing. I was looking forward to him in this film and was kind of disappointed he was killed off.",oyxaam
h7wdsa1,Guess Ariana stans are having a good week,oyxaam
h7y5442,"I like watching him, if Jackass had a reboot/younger set I'd fully expect him to be part of the crew.",oyxaam
h7w34vo,"When he appeared on screen some girl yelled out ""Pete Davidson!""",oyxaam
h7whx9x,I think he had the best death of the first squad,oyxaam
h7xoy2r,"I've never liked Pete Davidson in anything, and he always comes off as a smug scumbag, but this was the first time I actually found him appealing and likable in a movie, and then boom. I was actually looking forward to seeing more of his performance, which is a first.

EDIT: And before I get down-voted, I still empathize with him for what he has had to go through in life, and understand why he'd come off the way he does because of what he struggles with,  but he has always just come across like an ass hole and I've never found him funny. No disrespect.",oyxaam
h7xot2i,I hate him on SNL but liked seeing him in the movie for a few scenes.,oyxaam
h7wjepi,I was literally telling my wife how much I can’t stand him when the beach scene happened.,oyxaam
h859z2g,"I don’t hate him, I just don’t understand how he dates the hottest women on the planet",oyxaam
h8b8fvd,This was James Gunn's tribute to his favorite movie Gigli,oyxaam
h84y8v0,out of the loop:  Who is Pete Davidson and why do people hate/love him?  Why was he so good for the role?,oyxaam
h7w0n7c,I kind of hate that he’s getting his tattoos removed to be in more movies…because then we have to watch him in more movies.,oyxaam
h825rub,Ngl I was pretty happy I wasn't gonna have to see his face or hear his voice for the rest of the movie.,oyxaam
h7wtohq,"And Jai Courtney, too.  It was glorious!",oyxaam
h7wgrxb,We were cheering for him to die asap,oyxaam
h7xthrj,SNL already exoloded his head in a sketch so haters could have gotten their rocks off there.,oyxaam
h7xjh9r,My friend is obsessed with the weasel and I told him he’d like the first part because he died then I watched the end and freaked out,oyxaam
h7y5iyh,who?,oyxaam
h7z2mb1,"man, i was surprised to see him play two characters 

&#x200B;

the weasel was p. great",oyxaam
h807is2,My mother.,oyxaam
h82bwir,"As an Ariana Grande stan, I feel conflicted seeing his face get shot right off...",oyxaam
h83dd0d,The same applies to those who hate Jai Courtney as well. Farewell Captain Boomerang.,oyxaam
h86ilh8,I have no idea who that it is but I decide to believe it was milo yiannopoulos dying and that makes me very very happy,oyxaam
h87ac94,"This comment sold me on the movie, and I'm glad I watched it because of it.",oyxaam
h895fes,Him flexing and reaching for his gun was great,oyxaam
h89q9pe,"I don't even know who he is..
What's the fuss about him?",oyxaam
h8i455m,who hate's pete?,oyxaam
hbnesyl,And now he’s burned in the DC universe. No chance he shows up five years from now as the Flash.,oyxaam
hds0d8u,i'm pretty sure pete davidson hates pete davidson so he was stoked for the part.,oyxaam
hggqoy7,Lmfao thanks for the chuckle hahaha,oyxaam
h7zzw8u,I was thrilled.  Him and his stupid tattoos,oyxaam
h7wn0l2,It me!,oyxaam
h7x0llc,I really was hoping that I wouldn't have to see his face the whole movie. Guess that bullet took care of that for me.,oyxaam
h7zaw62,best part of the movie by far,oyxaam
h7wandd,I was like wtf is going on here?!?,oyxaam
h7w12ms,"Chekhov's bullet, though I expected it to go the other way where the little bullet was smashed by the larger one. It worked great either way.",oyxaam
h7wa4xr,"the second they pulled their guns i was like "" Smaller bullet gonna win and it's gonna be the dumbest callback and im gonna love it "" 

and i did.",oyxaam
h7xfce5,"In contrast, I knew they were going to somehow call back to ""starfish is slang for asshole.""",oyxaam
h80zq5i,"So many callbacks to what seemed like playful joke lines. ""I'll kill anyone I have to for peace"" should have been a red flag.",oyxaam
h7wz95u,I was confused though. Didn't Peacemaker say he had smaller bullets? But in the end Bloodsport did,oyxaam
h7wirrz,Same lol. Pretty clever callback,oyxaam
h7z8c6r,"Absolutely no expert on guns and ammunition, but wasn't Peacemaker's bullet a hollow point? For me it made me feel even more that he is just a scumbag",oyxaam
h7z7gv7,"I'm confused I thought peacemaker said that his aim was better because he shot smaller bullets which could fit into the bullet hole left by blood sports larger bullet hole, but when they fired at each other at the end it seemed that Bloodsport was shooting the smaller bullets am I missing something?",oyxaam
h815skk,"It was the best Vegeta vs Goku beam clash I have ever seen on the big screen, that's for sure.",oyxaam
h93r5m2,I was expecting a butthole call back,oyxaam
hggqrtm,That was honestly the best fucking scene that made me so pumpedddddd get rekt'd peacemaker also hell yeah DC is upping their quality movies omg can't wait for more,oyxaam
h7yeiqj,I loved that but wasn’t it peacemaker who supposedly had the smaller bullets in the convo in the beginning?,oyxaam
h7xl5ur,So how would Cena's small bullet go through a larger one anyway?,oyxaam
h7xtfh9,I'm really happy they explained that because I'm 7 years old and forget things that were mentioned only an hour ago,oyxaam
h829cwt,"As soon as I saw a close-up of Peacemaker's bullet, I immediately thought, ""that's a stupid shape for a bullet, why is it concave in the fron– oh, that bullet is getting destroyed by another bullet, isn't it?""",oyxaam
h80bybg,Callback to what?,oyxaam
h82o65h,call back to what? i saw that but missed the reference,oyxaam
h807ym5,"I just wish they didn't point it out. You laid the foundation and brought it back, you didn't need Cena and Elba to confirm it.",oyxaam
h7whz3k,I was the exact same. Avoided all the trailers and everything. Going in blind to a movie is always so satisfying to me. Trailers give way too much away.,oyxaam
h82efbi,"Exactly the same. The amount of laughs within the first 5 mins killed me.

I LOVED the scene in the plane and was so into the Boomer and Harley commradary and how casual and nuts they were.

I NEVER expected that almost entire team to just die!! And the actual squad team were so fucking good I didn't even get hung up on the original loss.

Jesus this movie was immense. Gunn deserves insane levels of praise for this.",oyxaam
h80uaa6,"I saw the trailers, but the trailers even set a completely different expectation for what the tone of this movie would be.

I was expecting slightly more violent GotG, and instead got SIGNIFICANTLY more violent, significantly more absurd comedic dialogue (like all the office comedy), and then some tragic tragic moments and heavy character developments.

I think it ranks in my Top 2 Superhero movies of all time, slightly below Dark Knight, slightly above Winter Soldier",oyxaam
h7x62cd,I went on Tuesday after work because I had a cheap cinema tickets offer and had seen the rotten tomatoes percentage was high so I was in the same boat as you and found it glorious too.,oyxaam
h80zmff,"I've been paying so little attention to mainstream media lately that I didn't even know it came out this week until just a few days ago. The only thing I had known about going in was that it had King Shark, John Cena, and Harley Quinn.

Having just finished watching it, I can confidently say I am a very happy comic-book movie fan.",oyxaam
h81b9rg,The only trailer I saw was before some other movie I watched in theaters this year. Haven’t seen the first Suicide Squad. I’d say I’m quite a Marvel fan (enjoyed GOTG a LOT) and the only DC movies I’ve seen are Nolan’s Batman and Joaquin Phoenix as Joker. I loved loved loved The Suicide Squad. I didn’t think the trailer I saw gave anything away because I was dumbfounded when Pete Davidson was offed so quickly. Overall I had a great time.,oyxaam
h81286x,"Watched the first trailer to make sure it at least looked like the type of movie I’d enjoy and then didn’t watch or read anything else. Glad I did that, because holy fuck",oyxaam
h811p22,"I only watched the first trailer, which was largely from the first half hour of the movie. The trailer didn’t hint at it but I assumed a lot of them would die, but I wasn’t expecting _all_ of them. Had 0 idea about Starro though, so that was great",oyxaam
h83lnfr,"I went in blind as well, it was glorious",oyxaam
h84xie4,"I didn't watch the trailers but I did get ""spoiled"" on a certain five armed being showing up but that just made me want to watch it.",oyxaam
h8aroft,Fuck I wish I had. The only problem I had with the film was how much of it was in the trailers.,oyxaam
h8c7lcb,same here. I try to avoid trailers at least for movies I'm very sure I will watch anyway.,oyxaam
h8c8pe6,Yep! I haven't seen many DC films outside of wonder women and Dark Knight trilogy and loved this. Tried watching batman vs superman and aquaman but couldn't get into them so I just avoided DC. really enjoyed this film,oyxaam
ha2q1b9,All I remembered was John cena. So I was incredibly confused when he was not a part of the first team,oyxaam
h80mbxh,I had my expectations set very low because of DCs track record and was blown away by how good it was.,oyxaam
h89i9wt,"I have no self-control whatsoever and decided to click on this clearly marked spoiler thread about 3 hours before I watched it and within three scrolls had most of the deaths, some of the bits, and a couple of the sequences spoilt for me.

It was still an absolutely fantastic movie with plenty of surprises in store, but I do wish I were capable of not being so incredibly and utterly slow in the head.",oyxaam
h84nle2,"Same, I was so mad that my theater's trailer of Free Guy had a spoiler that I would have loved to actually watch.  I was so down after the first SS and birds of prey that I didn't have much hope for this one until like 2 days before release when I saw the RT rating.  Really glad I watched this movie without any trailers.",oyxaam
h852aqa,I did not watch any trailers. I saw the RT score and just jumped in. Glad I did.,oyxaam
h8gf273,"I know the movie existed, I'd seen absolutely zero trailers.

 I was completely Amazed by what I saw I had no clue what I was going into. It was awesome",oyxaam
h8meotv,I went in completely blind too but I didn't like it.,oyxaam
h9o0vx1,"I only saw ""yo is this a dog"" and i didn't even remember that until the line happened. Blind on everything else and I loved it",oyxaam
h9rbyim,"I didn’t even see the first one lol, my friend just said “wanna watch the suicide squad?” And I said ok",oyxaam
hc55kcv,I only watched one trailer and thought it was an action movie so it was amazing to realise what the movie actually was,oyxaam
hggqttz,"ME. It was honestly bloody funtastic, my only regret was going with a friend who wasn't as into it as I am so I was the only hyped person and we had the entire cinema to ourselves too rip",oyxaam
h7wm3ip,Only for them to rehire him for us to get this film AND his vision of GOTG3. This truly is the best timeline.,oyxaam
h817hbb,"Seriously.  I'm not even upset about that anymore.  We got this which wouldn't have happened had he not gotten fired, and we still get *GotG3*?  Thanks disingenuous fuckwads that tried to cancel him!",oyxaam
h88tnv3,It feels like just yesterday he got fired and here we are watching this. Time flies,oyxaam
hggqx7j,YESSSSS AGREED,oyxaam
h7wxhiw,"When I saw Weasel get up and start running away, my very first thought I had was ""Oh yeah... He killed 27 kids."" XD

Edit: Corrected my crappy typing skills.",oyxaam

h7wq45t,And so the legend of the chupacabra begins…,oyxaam
h7wjb1q,He’ll become the Terror of Corto Maltese,oyxaam
h7wix8d,I bet he shows up as a villain in the Peacemaker series,oyxaam
h80nc13,I'm still mad Captain Boomerang died,oyxaam
h8653tc,Really happy that Weasel survived; that was my favorite character in the movie. Give Weasel a solo movie now! Maybe a romantic comedy.,oyxaam
h7wkkh9,I dunno.  Kinda like Steve Buscemi wandering off Scott free at the ebd of *Con Air*.  I hope.,oyxaam
h82zyt7,"I'm not that big of a dc fan, but could Weasel potentially be set up to become a villain in a future movie?",oyxaam
h80m50v,He's harmless,oyxaam
h7zptj6,Oh,oyxaam
ha4dfoj,Definitely gave me hardcore Deadpool 2 vibes lol,oyxaam
h7wdf5b,Those were top tier telenovela titties,oyxaam
h7wbo90,"Right? I belly laughed and thought ""Holy shit"" in a lot of parts of the movie, but that one 2 second shot made me audibly say ""holy shit"" lol.",oyxaam
h7w9b96,"Why'd you think she was hired as the Presidents secretary?

*you're welcome*",oyxaam

h7w9gwg,Gunn has one in GOTG1 as well,oyxaam
h7wdj9e,"Yeah that stuck out to me as well lol. I was expecting some sort of payoff to her character existing, but nope, just some extremely bouncy boobs for one short shot.",oyxaam

h7zv81d,"Mikeala Hoover?

She's a hot secretary in GOTG too lol",oyxaam

h7wusv1,It was honestly distracting. I couldn’t help but be impressed.,oyxaam
h80ueky,"Though as gory and R rated as this movie was, it was shockingly unsexual. Like some bouncing cleavage was the most we got, and there was an entire extended sequence that took place in a strip club.",oyxaam

h84omky,I laughed so fucking hard at that shot. Felt like an homage to some outlandish latin soap.,oyxaam
h7zc7vj,Yup. I thought something was going to happen to her right there because they were so distracting.,oyxaam
h83sluk,"She's a friend of Gunn if I'm not mistaken, I think her @ is mykaela or something in IG",oyxaam
h84fbci,I cracked up the second they were jiggling and felt awkward since my theater was silent.,oyxaam
h854kzs,Do you know which scene it was?,oyxaam
hggqwfw,Lmao yeah subtle bounces,oyxaam
h7w2k9g,I loved Bloodsport and thought the ending with him was cute. I’d personally like more of his character.,oyxaam
h7w0s5p,Him admitting that exploding bullets were dope and he had a fear of rats were absolutely hilarious and made him far more relatable in a weird way.,oyxaam
h7w29as,Every time I read Bloodsport I immediately think of that Jean Claude Van Damme movie.  I can’t help it.,oyxaam
h7wjjmn,I cant help but feel Idris Elba took this role as a way to really let out how much he does NOT get paid enough for some of the bullshit he deals with.,oyxaam
h81b9kl,"""Why the fuck would I want a leaf?"" Lmaooooo",oyxaam
h7wpwda,"This movie's wacky script sorely needed a straight man/fish-out-of-water/first-day-on-the-job character, and Idris nailed it.",oyxaam
h7wblpp,"Agreed, it's not something that's done too much these days but it's so effective. One of the reasons I always loved Indiana Jones as a character.",oyxaam
h7x764n,It was like they made an actually badass version your average superhero movie fan but still had him reacting like we would be reacting in all his scenes.,oyxaam
h809uux,"It's like he was trying to play the straight man badass killer, but also couldn't help but acknowledge how ridiculous the world he lives in is. Played to perfection!",oyxaam
h7y3m0g,The best part for me was that idris and capaldi both got to use their actual accents. So nice to hear,oyxaam
h7whnbo,"Idris Elba nailed the role imo, but as usual Margot stole all the scenes.",oyxaam
h7x10du,I need a Bloodsport re-invented by DC to be like what he was in this movie.,oyxaam
h7wry60,"his reaction to the starfish caught me off-guard and it was hilarious

&#x200B;

I forgot he wasn't with Flagg and them in the lab lol",oyxaam
h8a0wbm,"> Bloodsport constantly being hysterical and confused was one of the best parts of this movie.

""Jesus Christ""",oyxaam
h82bhxf,"It's frustrating, because I believe Will Smith's Deadshot in the first movie was originally supposed to be a role closer to what Idris Elba's Bloodsport was in this movie. I wish we could have gotten both performances so we could compare, but if the first one had been good we probably wouldn't have gotten this one, so ...",oyxaam
h7wir55,"I love this type of film but I just didn’t enjoy _this_ film.

I think suicide squads problem is unless they’re willing to split it up, like Marvel do with avengers, they try to fit far too much in a short space, meaning the film is jack of all trades but does none well.

Like, there’s no subtlety (I know the films meant to be outrageous, but I mean plot subtlety).  They’re so short on time they’re like:

Here’s 10 people! They have powers! Why? Who cares! They need to do this thing! Why? Very flimsy rationale why! We need an emotional scene out of nowhere, but we also need to fit constant jokes in so it’s funny, we also need loads of cool action.

Maybe the film is fine as is and I’m just expecting too much from a goofy film but, again, I couldn’t help but think this franchise could be so much more!",oyxaam
hb0diwf,"That's what keeps pissing me off when #ReleaseTheAyerCut bros keep attacking this movie and saying Bloodsport is just a copy of Deadshot. Besides the 2 of them being black, being good with guns, and having a daughter, they could not be more different.

Deadshot loved his daughter, whereas Bloodsport was clearly a terrible father. Deadshot was always calm, cool, and relaxed, whereas Bloodsport tried to be those things, but deep down was super antsy, panicky, and vulnerable.",oyxaam
hggqvu4,"Bloodsport was honestly my favourite throughout this nonsense, can't wait to see more of the dude lol",oyxaam
h7wb9y7,Same! Super cool design and audio effect!,oyxaam
h7zr5cd,They kinda put emphasis on it breaking I was expecting him to die when all the starfish came raining down afterwards because he no longer had something to cover his face.,oyxaam
h80rcan,"It kinda looked like a Xenomorph from Alien…which was dope, no complaints",oyxaam
h7zvubw,"It's the classic super hero troupe, they paid too much to the celebrity that they can't keep their mask on for the final act.",oyxaam
h86l5hh,"The scene where Harley sees Bloodsport, with his mask on, and Flagg sneakily running across the street… that was pretty damn funny.",oyxaam
h84wd3j,The mask/helmet gave me big time [Kroenen from Hellboy](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/FatNiftyAfricangoldencat-size_restricted.gif) vibes,oyxaam
h80xwtr,"I loved that mask too. And I actually thought that it will help him against the starfish attack. And when the mask broke, I thought he'll be mind controlled and team will have to fight him",oyxaam
h84z25d,I loved when he was wearing just that white tank top and the mask. It just looked funny without the rest of the suit. I guess it enhances his vision.,oyxaam
h9b4hy8,"That is something I liked about him compared to Will Smith's Deadshot. In the last movie, Will Smith rarely wore the mask. He was not playing Deadshot; it felt like he was just being Will Smith. Here, Idris Elba really becomes Bloodsport. And he wears the mask almost every opportunity he gets.  I don't see Elba; I see Bloodsport",oyxaam
h80wr47,"Gave me Predator vibes, such a badass character",oyxaam
h80xv2c,"His mask was bad ass, his whole schtick was great honestly. That kind of thing could be cheesy, but they made it badass.",oyxaam
h7ydpf3,"i didnt notice the details until right before it broke, great design",oyxaam
h7ws98k,"Honestly I found Weasel being alive at the end more terrifying than Starro demolishing half of the city and raising a zombie army. 

Not to mention all the heroic actions taken throughout the movie to save the kids from evil. Harley killing President Luna when he mentioned his plan to experiment on children. Waller’s staff knocking her out with a golf club to save the children from Starro. Only for the fucking weasel to be set loose on the island. Hide yo kids!",oyxaam
h7zy013,"TWENTY SEVEN CHILDREN! 

Catching him should be its own damn movie!",oyxaam
h81rnc7,Weasel’s walk is terrifying,oyxaam
h80jbgt,"I don’t know if you’ve ever read the novel Jurassic Park, but there’s a whole thing about Compys attacking babies in cribs on the Costa Rican mainland.

Weasel surviving and fleeing into the jungle gave me those same vibes.",oyxaam
h7zpw6m,Burn him,oyxaam
h80jkr4,I hope we get a Peacemaker episode catching up on him.,oyxaam
h812kye,I’d love if in the peacemaker show we see a news article or YouTube vid about a cryptid running rampant that just turns out to be Weasel,oyxaam
ht6j5q8,That's an excellent point.,oyxaam
h8088po,"Margot Robbie as Harley is one of the best interpretations of a comic book character ever put to film. 

Sure, it’s cool to have someone like Ledger put their own spin on a character but Margot literally feels like you just ripped Harley off the pages and put her on screen",oyxaam
h7yjqye,Can I still be Garth?,oyxaam
h7wgxi3,Nope.  Milton.,oyxaam
h8gsy8y,"She nailed that subtle line. Harley was being %100 honest like, ""dude you might be, I have no idea who you are but I'm having a good time""",oyxaam
h8olol8,I love that Harley was completely inconsequential to the plot of the film and was primarily a vehicle for dad jokes and internet memes. The 69 joke was so juvenile and perfect,oyxaam
h7wm8dd,Don't call me Shirley.,oyxaam
h88k8yj,Don't call me Shirley,oyxaam
h80cnez,"It seems like a lot of movies during the quarantine had to be released less than 100% finished. A lot of these jokes seemed like they need a few more takes to get right.

Maybe the writer for Harley has always seemed like that but her jokes just never work that great. 

Part of me thinks it is fine. Her jokes dont need to be funny, just that she is silly and crazy. 

But i think when she kills the president, that is the only one that ever really works. That is the silly mixed with crazy. I dont need to laugh out loud for it to work it just needs to be both of those things. Most the rest of the time she is just silly.

Compare to Nolans Joker. He isnt hysterical funny. But the fact he is making jokes while shoving someones head into a pencil is what works.

Edit: People really dislike what I had to say but not a lot of people have wanted to discuss it. I would love to talk about some of it. 

For example compare Quiet Place 1 from Quiet place 2. This was a hard movie to make a sequel but the sequel just seemed rushed to me. 

Look at Tenet. You cant tell me it was supposed to sound that bad. This is one of the biggest directors today and he has some of the longest exposition scenes in his movies and we cant hear it?

Mortal Kombat, maybe there is no script in which this is a better movie but it seems like there are parts that are bad or dumb, but for no reason other than to just finish the movie. 


There were a few others I watched the past year that just didnt feel completed. Like they werent able to or something. I dont know.",oyxaam
h9ciy3l,One of the funniest lines in the movie honestly,oyxaam
h7w4pbq,Was she the one dancing on the platform at the club? I was wondering why that lady looked so familiar!,oyxaam
h7w355j,Imagine if Gunn was able to spread out other Guardians in the background like that.,oyxaam
h7wbqi7,Lloyd Kaufman of Troma fame was sitting at the bar right before it cut to her. Love seeing Gunn use that scene to tie figures from his wide career into this one.,oyxaam
h7w5x6y,I'm so glad Gunn kept the camera on her a little longer because I didn't recognize her at first,oyxaam
h80qij1,"Speaking of cameos, the doctor at the start injecting Savant with a nanobomb is the dude who created the suicide squad comic",oyxaam
h7whloh,And Taika Waititi lol!!,oyxaam
h7wh98e,He said in over one hundred reviews no one caught it. How do you not recognize her instantly? I’d only seen her with the Mantis makeup before my wife put on Black Mirror and I said “oh it’s Mantis without the shit on her face.”,oyxaam
h80h7x8,"So that's the GotG cameo James Gunn was talking about. He was disappointed no one had found it yet. (Last I checked, I'm sure others have also found her.)",oyxaam
h81q8km,Damn i thought i was racist for thinking that was her,oyxaam
h7w2b39,where was she?,oyxaam
h7x6pu6,I was also really surprised at seeing Batista standing still in the corner of that scene.,oyxaam
h7w2lqk,Wait who did she play?,oyxaam
h7we1wf,I was trying to see if I can catch any of the guardians. Where was she?,oyxaam
h8dtbwy,I loved that club scene. It looks like such a good time for them drinking and dancing. I need one of those fun drunk nights. Hopefully someday…,oyxaam
h8wmgqy,I thought that was her!,oyxaam
h7zuvsz,Yondu too!,oyxaam
h8580oa,"I wasn't sure at first because her tits seemed a lot bigger that I remembered, as vulgar as that sounds, made me wonder if she had work done or something.",oyxaam
h8acxki,"I have a bit of an issue with it being called a cameo ... now, if it was Mantis it would be a cameo.  In this case, it's just an actor appearing.   Is that really a cameo?",oyxaam
h7yrc1p,No wonder why I thought I saw a familiar face during the movie,oyxaam
h84zh7g,Lloyd Kaufman was in there too. Gunn's mentor.,oyxaam
h8bce4v,"Gunn's ex. Guess they are still on good terms. Now he's dating Jennifer Holland, who was the hot blond techie.",oyxaam
h7vxkaq,"And he will, peace at all cost",oyxaam
h7wifo4,"I'm blown away at how much better Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flag is in this iteration. This is the same actor and character who delivered the iconic line:
>This is Katana. She's got my back. She can cut all of you in half with one sword stroke, just like mowing the lawn. I would advise not getting killed by her. Her sword traps the souls of its victims. 

Now he's funny and a proper badass. Not many actors get a chance to redeem themselves with a character when the original is so shit.",oyxaam
h7vzar6,"I thought he was going to make it, only because he had been so close before but still survived. 

I’m with you, Peacemaker can fuck right off.",oyxaam
h7wiacd,I’m genuinely sad about what happened to Flagg. I’m interested on how they handle the Peacemaker series since he’s kind of unlikeable now.,oyxaam
h7xcxzz,"Flagg was a pretty well done character.

Peacemaker was too, in a villainous sort of way.

But they completely fucked up Milton.",oyxaam
h7w3djg,"Cena was great, but idk how excited I am for the spinoff tbh...",oyxaam
h7weuiv,I thought cena was great because when he realized he killed flag you could see on his face that there may be regret and that it was unnecessary  and im thinking the show might see him grow to learn that some extremes arent the right thing,oyxaam
h7wpybq,"Fr Joel Kinnaman killed it, ended up rooting for Rick Flag up until the end",oyxaam
h7xfa3w,"This was genuinely the biggest shock to me. I've read a lot of comics featuring Rick Flagg. I've watched all the different animated iterations of him. Kinnaman being a boring wet blanket in the first movie wasn't surprising to me because that's always how I saw the character. Hell, I always thought that was kinda the point. But he's charming and likable here?? Astonishing.",oyxaam
h7wa5mk,i was legitimately sad and upset when he died 😔,oyxaam
h7vzpvk,A beach full of dicks*,oyxaam
h7ykyc5,Was really hoping at the end it was Rick Flagg they saved rather than Peacemaker,oyxaam
h7wlj09,Because it actually gave him substance instead of making him generic army man. Much closer to his comic self.,oyxaam
h7wd8vi,He can eat a whole beach of dicks as far as I'm concerned,oyxaam
h7xg37n,"I only just watched For All Mankind so I was loving Kinnaman, absolutely devastating.",oyxaam
h7xhy4c,"I thought him saying his willingness to kill anyone that stands in the way of peace was a great side joke. Nah, this fucker was ready to kill Ratcatcher 2.0 for maybe whistleblowing",oyxaam
h7w9iuf,"I was hoping Rick was going to make it and then he didnt, wonder what they are going to do with the Peacemaker show.",oyxaam
h7ymgvf,I cared about Rick in Suicide Squad too. I like the actor. Too bad they killed him.,oyxaam
h8137ey,If only he had Katana watching his back.,oyxaam
h7wdkdx,"He’s the perfect solider for Waller, as he can do what Flag did and buys her bullshit",oyxaam
h81gb8h,"I was legit sad when he died. He was nice enough in the first movie, but pretty bland. They actually made me care about the guy here and I was hoping he would make it out.",oyxaam
h84aj72,"I appreciated the ""x-ray"" shot so there's absolutely no doubt.",oyxaam
h86gv8d,"I wonder if Joel Kinnamen was like ""Hey you think this time I could be a good guy?"" and Gunn was like ""Eh, sure.""",oyxaam
h7wq2xy,"They rehabbed Rick Flag pretty well, but I still found his anti-government conspiracy cover-up turn a bit out of left field.
  
But I also 100% believe it's because I've been watching all these Suicide Squad (2016) recaps on YouTube from content creators looking to take advantage of the algorithm, and I'm reminded of what he was like in that movie.",oyxaam
h7wu71y,He's brainwashed tho. You can see deep inside he didn't wanna kill ratcatcher 2 but he was so brainwashed by the government/waller that he really did believe that messed up things he did were essential.,oyxaam
h84c0ay,"The thing with Peacemaker is, for the first time in his acting career, John Cena actually..well....acted. There's something there to feed this series they are making.   


But yeah, completely agree, I can't believe this movie got me to care about Rick Flagg. Wasn't prepared for that.",oyxaam
h7xgxmb,"He would eat a whole beach of dicks, if he needed to for peace.",oyxaam

h86ob0v,this movie made me actually care for the characters more than the first 1.,oyxaam
h88vzy1,Same. He was such an uninteresting character in the first movie. James Gunn is a genius.,oyxaam

h8g08se,Joel Kinnamon did a great job portraying him.,oyxaam
h8g3s2i,"I don’t know if it’s that he was entirely forgettable in the first movie, or that I binged all “For All Mankind” a month ago and just took more notice of the actor (Joel Kinnaman) with this new film….but yeah,  I really enjoyed his character in this one.",oyxaam

h80jvmn,The best part is we watched it as a big group over discord and everyone was like SHIT THAT'S TRUE THO just before Idris said so,oyxaam
h83g4q8,"John Cena’s delivery of that line was awesome, and Idris’ response the cherry on top.",oyxaam

h89jz09,My friend said this to me a couple days before we watched the movie together and then this happened xDDD,oyxaam

h84q0t2,"I was expecting Idris Elba, John Cena, and Margot Robbie to be great, but the Ratcatcher girl was unexpectedly really compelling and great as well, so she stood out for me",oyxaam

h8g8f96,"I think I'm noticing that it's a trademark of Gunn that pretty much every character is memorable in some way, even if they only have one or two lines.  Like the guy in the first GOTG who says ""that was my favorite knife""... I'll always remember him just because of that one silly-ass line.",oyxaam
h82u134,The Thinker was under-utilised imo but apart from that everyone else was used to full effect.,oyxaam

h87c646,"Honestly I love how everyone, from Savant to Bloodsport and Peacemaker seem to have the same superhuman aim/precision/dexterity that Deadshot has. Just ""fuck it, you ain't special"", and they even go further by having Bloodsport and Peacemaker have the exact same backstory ahaha.",oyxaam
h8c59gr,Him also getting bummed out by Peacemakers cool kill,oyxaam
h7wyxxf,Idris Elba did so damn good. Will Smith current day wouldn't have come close.,oyxaam
h7zqoqp,I agree with Ratcatcher 2 she was like this movie’s version of Laura from Logan,oyxaam
h80h3kk,"Is this something that is confirmed? There are definitely parallels to the gun mastery, daughter motivated characters but I felt he was different enough that it didn't seem like it was originally written for Smith's Deadshot.",oyxaam
h85rjqi,"Sorry Will Smith, you’ve been replaced",oyxaam
h86rfm5,"I feel like they purposely lampshaded the fact that they used Bloodsport instead of Deadshot with Peacemaker too, with how he had the exact same introduction Bloodsport.",oyxaam
h8hakml,I knew she’d save the day. Rats can fuck shit up.,oyxaam
h9b63e1,"I think Bloodsport was refreshing. Deadshot in SS 2016 was really just Will Smith. He hardly wore the mask and was just acting as himself. Idris Elba is unrecognizable. And plus, he wears that badass mask every chance he can. He actually becomes the character, and I love that.",oyxaam
h9uxqxo,Was not expecting him to be the de facto lead,oyxaam
h7w5u71,Bloodsport is a poor man's Deadshot,oyxaam
h82g3fe,Yeah Will Smith just wouldn’t have came close to Elba’s performance. He absolutely bloody smashed it.,oyxaam
h83vhv9,"Yup. He could have been Deadshot and it changes nothing about the character, his story, or abilities. I bet Gunn wrote the script with him as the lead and Will Smith turned it down.",oyxaam
h7vzw0e,That whole sequence in the the rain was absolutely stunning. Never thought a guy being torn apart would be beautiful,oyxaam
h7x7i5o,[Will these do?](https://imgur.com/a/Jt9xCAz),oyxaam
h7wbw7s,Looked like a mortal kombat fatality,oyxaam
h7wx31e,"That and the scene of the fight being reflected in Peacemaker's helmet were really great. 

James Gunn is just a good damn director.",oyxaam

h7wlzwe,Funny I immediately said I want that as a gif after watching it.,oyxaam
h7wmjw6,Big GKOTM vibes,oyxaam
h7xou36,I literally yelped when this happened.  Thank the lord there are some directors who just know what they have and how to use it.,oyxaam
h87gp5o,That exact moment is the first time I’ve ever considered getting a tattoo.,oyxaam

h7wecy1,Oh hey it's Steve the Pirate!,oyxaam
h858tv4,I saw dodgeball literally right before the suicide sqaud. Scary coincidence.,oyxaam
h8antm4,Pirates are in this year >:(,oyxaam
h7wfm2e,That was one shiny toilet bowl.,oyxaam
h7xh38f,"Did you see Cena's ""You fucked up now"" stance when it started?  He knocks Flagg down and does this stance with his arms all the way down.  It was intimidating as fuck.",oyxaam
h7w3vwb,I just appreciated that it was something different.,oyxaam
h7woagj,Yeah to have that fight reflected on “a beacon of freedom” was a great touch,oyxaam
h7y170q,Flag getting his shit wrecked in the reflection of the Toilet Seat of Freedom was so disrespectful! /s,oyxaam
h7xgr7q,"Totally, but two seconds in I wondered how you'd edit the camera out of the reflection",oyxaam
h8165ak,What a genius shot,oyxaam
h81sgm4,"My only nitpick, because I think it was a cool shot/effect, is that it felt like it lingered on the helmet for too long before cutting back.",oyxaam
h8q8k5v,I’m not a big movie guy. But i did take some video classes in college. And i loved that shot so much and knew my teachers would’ve LOVED it,oyxaam
h848x3y,yeah my favorite part was how I couldnt see what was happening,oyxaam
h9p2279,"Anyone else thinking ""this will be on VFX Artists React 100%"" during that scene? xD",oyxaam
h7xy8n7,It's because they're reflections of each other,oyxaam
h812v4a,A short scene of Jason Statham jumping on King Shark from behind and wrestling him to the ground would have made the movie.,oyxaam
h8139gz,Won’t be long til it’s shown for Shark Week,oyxaam
h81hll5,"Discovery Channel really missed an opportunity because they aired Shark Week like 2 weeks ago, there easily could’ve been a funny special about King Shark to tie into the release of the movie",oyxaam

*King Sharknado*.",oyxaam
hggr4wz,LOL yes,oyxaam
h7w8ij5,Especially having Flag/Harley/Boomerang in that group so that it's not obvious.,oyxaam
h7wayii,It's such a boss decision. By killing off high profile talent that were introduced with a decent amount of characterization so early sets the stakes high because ANYONE can die.,oyxaam
h7x5npw,I kind of wish the flashback didn't come so quick. I was *rolling* when I realized the MC team was coming in later I just wish they had stretched that moment a little longer,oyxaam
h80jgzs,"My only wish is that the trailers had focused on them instead of the real protagonists. I knew going in that “these guys are gonna get slaughtered”, would have been better if the trailers made it look like they were the main characters.",oyxaam
h7y2owq,"I thought, oh wow, they're just jumping right in, no backstory, no setup, just BAM off we go. Then....",oyxaam
h804dcd,To be fair deadpool did the same thing with X Force a few years ago. Still liked it in this though.,oyxaam
h80j7el,"I don't think it was Waller's plan she just sent in 2 teams and one got betrayed by Pete Davidson, the distraction just worked out for the other team.",oyxaam
h7xhji7,"James Gunn is the living idea of ""ran out of superheroes, just make more gg ez""",oyxaam

h82gt2s,Wasn't Elba's team actually Team B?,oyxaam
h84oydz,"*Bloodsport when he arrives back to HQ*: hey thanks for the diversion back at the beachfront. 

*Desk Team awkwardly turns away slowly*",oyxaam
h8502we,"I remember people on Reddit predicting Savant would be the first to die, so it was interesting to see him stand back while pretty much everyone else got themselves killed.",oyxaam
h8b3eup,yeah i expected them to die but not as a diversion,oyxaam
hggr5rp,Yeah at the start I was like what the fuck and then bam death ah nice twist lol,oyxaam
h8ddt8o,but it made no sense - why would you waste a bunch of assets when a group of regular soldiers would have provided the same distraction?,oyxaam
h8p3hag,"The Flagg actor is also incredibly good in the first season of Altered Carbon, if you haven't yet seen that",oyxaam
h8uaj80,Wait wait wait wait... Peacemaker is getting a spinoff?! Who makes it? It might be the first DC series I watch.,oyxaam
h7zga52,"I was so disappointed by that at first. I was like ""oh great, these credits are spoiling the fact that Davidson, Fillion, et al are gonna be back for the rest of the movie. I was convinced we'd just seen a dream sequence or something.

Nope. I was wrong.",oyxaam
h7x1coo,Someone actually made a Reddit thread asking for movies/actors that have done this a week or 2 ago. I saw the movie last week (UK) and so wanted to mention it but didn't want to spoil it.,oyxaam
h7vysd0,I need a ratcatcher spinoff. The actress is wonderful and the character was fantastic.,oyxaam
h7w0cqh,that scene with Taika was ridiculously good.,oyxaam
h7we6tm,Ratcatcher was my favorite character. Such a big heart on her.,oyxaam
h7vzbfy,John Murphy is one helluva composer!  Seriously underrated,oyxaam
h7w63l0,"Never thought I’d give two shits about a character named Ratcatcher 2. But James Gunn and Daniela Melchior found a way. What a breakout role for her. Fantastic scene, loved seeing Taika, and the beautiful score from John Murphy was the cherry on top.",oyxaam
h7w26lz,Did they ever explain why she was so sleepy?,oyxaam
h811ruy,"Hers was actually the only character that I really connected with. The actress did an absolutely terrific job, and that CG little rat was cute as all fuck 

“....is that rat waving at me? Why?”",oyxaam
h7wh1jw,"Yeah I love Gunns super hero colorful epic emotional moments.

1st guardians when groot protects all of them and dies. 

2nd guardians with yondus funeral. 

This movie rat catcher/Harley inside Starro moment. Never thought rats eating a giant starfish could be so beautiful haha",oyxaam
h7w8gon,So happy that Ratcatcher 2 got a lot of screentime and honestly she's so cute and yet dorky cool. I love how friendly she was with Nanaue/King Shark. My favorite member of the Squad for the film.,oyxaam
h7xf3xx,"I really grew to love her character over the film. Going in I wasn't expecting to get emotion at the film, just have a fun movie experience. But her whole triumphant scene really got me tearing up. A+ acting",oyxaam
h8372g5,"The music was beautiful. I watched the movie yesterday in the night and already heard that song for about 10 times on Spotify. 

It's called „Ratism“ by John Murphy

„If rats have purpose, so do we all“ 

That got straight into my heart",oyxaam
h7w4hts,I expect the character to be a surprise hit for audiences. Charmingly played by the actress,oyxaam
h7w0qta,And Taika Waititi playing her dad was a nice touch.,oyxaam
h7wlo2a,Why was she always so sleepy? I'm not familiar with the character.,oyxaam
h7ym6sy,I wish they gave her more screen time. She was much more interesting than Harley.,oyxaam
h81s1jj,"James Gunn: ""I fucking told Marvel people would love Squirrel Girl, but they wouldn't let me do it. So Ratcatcher it is!""",oyxaam
h80sulj,"I feel that marvel made a mistake not going through with that series with Squirrel Girl. Seriously, controlling rats/squirrels would basically trump most powers",oyxaam
h80bd6w,"I actually almost got tears in my eyes when they did the flashback with her dad. Didn't expect that from a DCU movie, but I'm really impressed by how fun and awesome the movie was.",oyxaam
h80fqxp,Soundtrack was on point. Can't believe I heard a fratelli song in a big budget movie,oyxaam
h80jerd,You're right. That piece of the score was so beautiful. Could be one of my favorite sequences in a comic book movie. That shit was magic,oyxaam
h80qp9l,I hate to think that my city probably has that many rats.,oyxaam
h84138y,"Also - that moment when you realize the original Ratcatcher is played by Taika Waititi...  


So many cameos!",oyxaam
h841fdz,Do we know the name of the track?!,oyxaam
h84ff7n,I like that Taika came in for a minute to give the movie a moral lol,oyxaam
h84fujg,I totally thought shed be one of the dead ones,oyxaam
h87hqi9,That shit teared me up,oyxaam
h88mrn6,I'm downright shocked that they didn't kill off the cute animal sidekick. Either of them!,oyxaam
h8fwizn,I reminded me of a rock version of [Adagio in D minor](https://youtu.be/MGbC730C4BA?t=90) from Sunshine,oyxaam
h8hth5p,Just one of many wonderful things about her,oyxaam
i1zadd6,She really was I want more of Daniela Melchior as her! I mean ratism the scores name during that scene,oyxaam
h7z0a18,"Man, I thought that music was awful. Interesting to see so many people thought the opposite. I felt like it made that scene feel like a cheesy, low budget CW superhero show / Doctor Who.",oyxaam
h7wvb8u,"> I wasn't expecting her to be the heart of the movie

Seriously? I don't care enough to check if you are a bot/shill, but I'd bet on that",oyxaam
h7wfvu8,That rooftop title of Jotunheim* with the building fixtures at different depths was just gorgeous,oyxaam
h7wfqw9,"i didn't like the first one that was the soap on the toilet rim as i thought it was a bit hard to parse, especially if you aren't super familiar with english.

but i also really liked when the one changed from ""operation jotun(?)"" to ""operation harley""",oyxaam
h7wj0ci,That James Gunn's got style.,oyxaam
h80w0io,Especially Savant’s death turning into “Warner Bros. Pictures presents”. Definitely one of the more creative opening credits I’ve ever seen.,oyxaam
h7wxond,Reminded me of Hunt for The Wilderpeople which is hilarious,oyxaam
h7xtz7v,Exactly it was the first superhero movie where I felt I was watching a comic,oyxaam
h7wp68i,"To me it almost played more like the recent mini-series from other things we've been seeing.  Like, I loved that this was a full movie but I could see some people deciding ""We can split this into 5 episodes!"" and getting their way.  I loved the flow of it all. At certain points I was sure ""oh we are near the end"" only to be reminded that there's other shit going on over there we have to catch up on. Great choice.",oyxaam
h7xb47y,I feel like this is something that is really lacking from the Marvel movies lately for me. Dont get me wrong i love them too but at times they feel like they are lowest common denominator cashgrabs. This feels like the opposite and it works so well.,oyxaam
h7whhik,I just didnt like how some of them were hard to read.,oyxaam
h81uydr,Plenty of splash pages too,oyxaam
h826bbm,James Gunn is a master at his craft,oyxaam
h84xeyr,I was also just impressed by the graphical subtitles for translation. Such a creative way to tackle it to make it look like a comic. Going to basically redefine something so common.,oyxaam
h84zwqq,"That was actually the only thing that I didn't like. A few movies are doing that now, splitting things into named chapters, and this one was particularly gratuitous.",oyxaam
h8iqk6i,"The whole style of the movie felt like some kind of Wes Anderson (moonrise kingdom) mixed with Tarantino but in a way that also really feels like James Gunn. 

I liked the Snyder cut and some of what Birds of Prey tried to do but this is one of the best DC movies visually that has its own personality and a lot of heart that’s been missing story wise.",oyxaam
h834ptw,It took me quite a while to realize they were chapter titles.,oyxaam
h9qyier,"> the structure and spirit of a comic book.

Now that you point it out, they do seem exactly like issue title art",oyxaam
hggr94m,"Oh shit whattt they were chapter titles from the comic or like acts ya mean? Either way agreed, freaking loved that this entire film is like my favourite film of the fuckin yearrrr",oyxaam
h7wdnm0,It would be issue titles if we’re talking comic books lol,oyxaam
h7yu26d,His helmet is 10/10,oyxaam
h7wcos0,Top 3 comicbook movie costume!,oyxaam
h7zyy6x,His helmet was sick. Looked like a xenomorph.,oyxaam
h80yg94,"For real, they made a bunch of goofy fucking characters legit bad ass and cool looking. Especially Bloodsport.",oyxaam
h7y117v,It gave slight [Vanitas](https://images.khinsider.com/Kingdom%20Hearts%20Birth%20by%20Sleep/Renders/Main%20Characters/Vanitas01.png) vibes.,oyxaam
h80ouvr,Reminded me of Red Hood,oyxaam
h826cof,"I’m happy that they didn’t have to plaster idris Elbas face the entire movie like they did with will Smith, it was nice seeing him in it the entire time until it breaks at the end. The best of both worlds, have him in costume most of the action scenes but let idris have some face in the final 15 minutes.",oyxaam
h84v3up,"The skull mask was dope as fuck. He looked like a sadistic, long lost member of Daft Punk lol",oyxaam
h81plvy,Also his weapons are so dope,oyxaam
h7yjwnj,Isn't it the same costume Idris Elba wore in Hobbs and Shaw?,oyxaam
h7zgmbq,Fucking cool,oyxaam
h848qzs,"Dope as *fuuuuck* 

That's how cool.",oyxaam
h884uyp,Seeing him work in that outfit just made me more excited for whenever Deathstroke is finally gonna appear in a movie for more than a few seconds,oyxaam
h80mooc,Titty Guns were amazing,oyxaam
h88tfm4,So Where did he get all his toys from?,oyxaam
h9p2hid,His costume looked amazing with and without the helmet.,oyxaam
h8zx13v,Cool enough for me to buy his fortnite skin 😎,oyxaam
hggr9gp,So fuckin cool,oyxaam
h82vaau,"Loved his helmet, was not a fan of his little guns that came off of his armor. The gun *upgrades* however, were fucking sick.",oyxaam
h84piio,They really nailed that for me. His helmet was ridiculously dope. And I really appreciated the functionality of his suit to weapons. Felt like something batman would make.,oyxaam
h7x2e13,She was the heart of the film and was a delight.  I hope she gets many more roles.,oyxaam
h7wgkim,literally her first English-language role. what an incredible find.,oyxaam
h7woxhq,"Fun fact: She was born in 1996. Which, you guessed it, was Year of the Rat.

Get ready to see this same fact posted ad nauseam over the next few years.",oyxaam
h7wvgq1,"Even in Portugal she was not very popular before this … she entered in some soap operas and some indie Portuguese movies before , she’s still young and has a long career ahead , good to see they revamp her origin story so she comes from the city I was born ( Porto )",oyxaam
h7x2wyg,Really want a sequel to this and need her to live,oyxaam
h809gy7,"It's interesting reading how she almost didn't get the part cause of her agent's suggestion to dress up all fancy when meeting Gunn for the first time in person, or her audition tape was her just reading the lines and she thought it was crap.",oyxaam
h7wsl3j,*Melchior,oyxaam
h7zxee6,"Yup. I loved her... and I love rats, so her love for rats was all the more endearing.",oyxaam
h824nn2,I'm impressed they took a foreign actress to play a foreigner instead of an American or British actress imitating an accent,oyxaam
h809h8s,"Yeah, her character was my favorite.    


I'd be excited to see her show up in a Batman movie down the road.",oyxaam
h82b5sb,"Gorgeous woman appears on screen trying to go back to sleep, but when she does get her hair is a messy rat's nest (the phrase, not literally). Immediately loved her, and then the movie kept giving me more reasons to.",oyxaam
h83lha9,She reminded me of Diane Guerrero from Doompatrol.,oyxaam
h86q3pj,She's definitely going places. This was a star-making role for her,oyxaam
h7yv1w2,Reminds me of Ana de armas. Stars in a few local films and then goes big in hollywood,oyxaam
h83222x,"Not to be a contrarian, but I hope she remains intact",oyxaam
h8345dw,"Oh so she's actually portuguese, TIL.",oyxaam
h80j9f3,Could totally see her being a bond girl.,oyxaam
h80twtr,I honestly could see her wining an Oscar in a few years,oyxaam
h8z98y3,Its surprising they cast a no name for a key role in a movie where even the cgi character is voiced by sylvestor stallone. She killed it though and definitely the biggest winner of anyone involved in the project,oyxaam
h9zlaa7,The acting find of 2021.,oyxaam
hbnfry7,But not like Savant.,oyxaam
h80s96c,Was I the only one who thought her performance was the worst in the film? She was overacting through the whole thing.,oyxaam
h7w12xc,That shot of him ripping the soldier apart in the rain was absolutely stunning. I loved him in this and Harley Quinn. His CG was also some of the best work I’ve ever seen done on a character.,oyxaam
h7wahqy,"I felt so bad for him that his new octopus ""friends"" tried to eat him. And the way the movie was offing people, I was worried that at that moment that was going to be his death scene. 

What was the book he was ""reading"" back in prison anyway?",oyxaam
h7wfn0s,"Stallone's ""HURHURHUR""s after meeting his ""new friends"" in the tank destroyed me. He's SO hilarious.",oyxaam
h7w408q,Whoever was in charge of mo-capping and animating king shark did an amazing job.,oyxaam
h7xjdwn,The moustache line had me rolling.,oyxaam
h7wg0b2,And it was Sylvester Stallone!,oyxaam
h7y4hzj,Nom nom? No nom nom!,oyxaam
h87f0j5,Loved how he just casually walks up the ramp waving at the squad while licking his fingers. King Shark was awesome.,oyxaam
h7wjtum,"When they showed him wandering up in the wide shot, I thought it was going to cut to him with a big fat belly, finally satisfied.",oyxaam
h7wtsdm,The sound of the skull being scraped with his teeth was perfect.,oyxaam
h7wy2a1,King Shark rolled up to that last fight with the energy of a girl in Ugg's 15 minutes late to class with a Starbucks latte.,oyxaam
h9vvxz4,I really loved his pride at sticking the bomb to the wall only to turn around and no one was there to appreciate his hard work.,oyxaam
h7y0p3y,why didnt they let him eat corpses D:,oyxaam
h8bfec7,For me the best King Shark moment was during the assault on the insurgent camp to “rescue” Flagg. The simple visual of him sneaking through the jungle had my wife and I laughing so hard we had to rewatch it several times. I’m always a fan of the big guy tries to do a sneak trope but they really nailed it here. Something so very playful about it right before he murders a dude.,oyxaam
hggrbf7,I mean why can't he Nom Nom also I kind of wanted to see him Nom Nom ratcatcher too nice of an ending but I'll take it!,oyxaam
h7we8mc,There’s a “trivia” piece on the movie’s IMDb page that says Gunn described the movie as a 1970s war movie action comedy. That is the exact vibe I got and it was fucking glorious.,oyxaam
h7waz1b,"Totally agree it was like if Predator and Tropic Thunder had a baby. And then Guardians of the Galaxy and Commando had a baby. And then those 2 babies had a baby and then we got this, baby.",oyxaam
h7x0xl3,"Corto Maltese was in Tim Burton's Batman too, fun fact.",oyxaam
h824ots,"Resident of Panama here, we knew they were shooting here in late 2019/early 2020 (know a few people involved in the production), but to see the old quarter stand in for the nicer parts of Corto Maltese (outside president’s residence, etc.) and see the Atlantic side city of Colón get straight up wrecked by a giant alien starfish had me hollering.",oyxaam
h7yqk8d,They picked a great actual location to film for it too it’s a historical district in Panama that was ravaged by pirates.,oyxaam
h7ws31c,There were a lot of moments of pure ridiculousness that reminded me of the Far Cry series. Which is perfect because the next game will also be set in a Latin American island nation with a despotic leader.,oyxaam
h7wcfsa,They should’ve had it set in Val Verde!,oyxaam
h7x1wiy,Somewhere Vicky Vale was there taking pictures.,oyxaam
h7xht5q,I spent the whole movie thinking: why do I know the name Corto Maltese? Then I remembered it's the place where Vicki Vale took the pictures that caught caught Joker's eye. Such a great callback.,oyxaam
h7w9a69,Omg that’s so true,oyxaam
h81ftnb,Some obscure island nation is plotwise perfect for a movie about black ops team of super villains. Unlike previous movie that is set in American megapolis.,oyxaam
h7xxaja,now this I like,oyxaam
h83kmwc,This was a great Just Cause movie,oyxaam
h7vxunz,I so desperately wanted to see more of him using his powers! But I guess his powers are a bit too Alpha compared to the rest of the squad that it would have cut the tension of all the action scenes.,oyxaam
h7vygq3,"Closely followed by Ratcatcher 2, even more impressive considering this is Daniela Melchior’s first major role and Dastmalchian has been working for a good few years.",oyxaam
h7vx24v,I think you mean his mother stole it.,oyxaam
h7w589a,If he aimed at the center of Starro he 100% could have killed it himself,oyxaam

""That's kind of our thing.""

^""Yeah""",oyxaam
h7wssh9,Polka dot man could have been then hero but decided to use his power to burn off the tip of one of five limbs instead of going for the giant weak point in the middle that everyone else figured out.,oyxaam
h7vxls3,You spelled 'Sebastion' wrong,oyxaam
h7wivgt,He was the El Diablo of this movie. The only one qualified for the mission and they kill them off for no reason.,oyxaam
h7vxafq,The man has moves. Zemo could learn a thing or two.,oyxaam
h84obqj,"I am so happy for the actor; David Dastmalchian. I got to meet him outside a trailer award show I attended a few years back. I saw him and was like “hey, I know you, you’re great! I wish you were in more stuff.” He smiled and went, “yea, me too.” Super cool guy. Shot the shit with him for a bit before we got our car. I will always root for that guy.",oyxaam
h7wq0fz,"He was great, but his mother stole the show.",oyxaam
h7xxfly,Polka-Dot Man's Mom stole the show.,oyxaam

h7zc7e1,"When I first heard about Guardians of the Galaxy I thought it is a joke, I was thinking that someone is crazy to make a movie about a raccoon and a tree. Now it is my favourite Marvel movie.

When I was watching some trailer for suicide squad I was thinking that polka dot man and some others are so lame. This son of a ... again made me like characters which I thought are too weird to work in the movie!",oyxaam
h818rrw,"""I'm sorry that its so flamboyant""",oyxaam
h7w197s,"his line read of ""...it's ...easier"" is PERFECT.  just the perfect amount of pause before Easier",oyxaam
h7w7vyq,Agreed! He was the best. Glad he was around for most of it at least.,oyxaam
h7weuhl,"I disagree

However, there is no right answer.

I think it’s so awesome that this movie had so many characters that people can argue who actually stole the show.

Everyone connected with at least one character and the opinions are going vary wildly in the best way possible.",oyxaam

h7wifqu,I think his mom was the one that actually stole the show.,oyxaam
h7xyzbr,He really does just throw dots at people.,oyxaam
h80iz3r,I’m curious to see if they use a brother or sister of his in a future installment. Feels like they were hinting at that a bit when discussing his backstory,oyxaam
h80rq3l,"I really enjoyed him, but I thought Peacemaker stole the show…and Ratcatcher 2…and King Shark.

The only reason Idris Elba and Margot Robbie didn’t steal the show is because I already had high expectations for them that they met",oyxaam

XD",oyxaam
hggrc3h,Polka-Dot Man's mother issues you mean,oyxaam
h7w2da7,Yes,oyxaam
h7w6dqv,lol I caught that too,oyxaam
h7wfart,"Yeah, she was the redhead dancer. I've heard murmurs of that cameo before seeing the movie last weel, but I was surprised it was actually legit.",oyxaam
h7wgu0v,"Oh, yeah.  Forgot about that.  She never even came into play.  What was up with that?  Just a James Gunn cameo?  I was expecting the character to get caught up in their escapades at the club or something but it went nowhere.",oyxaam
h7wjifm,What a weird cameo. Contributed nothing to the film except for Pom’s Poms.,oyxaam
h859ymu,"You should probably watch the post credits scene

Edit: Apparently that wasn’t flag I totally thought it was",oyxaam
h7wlvs1,"John Woo would be jealous.  Then again, he'd probably think it needed more doves.",oyxaam
h7y2oq2,reminds me of River in Serenity,oyxaam
h8ffnnh,I was hoping for an equilibrium homage,oyxaam
h99da4n,That entire scene was just awesome,oyxaam
h7zv4an,That was SO a nod to Harrow's whorehouse rampage in Boardwalk Empire.,oyxaam
h7wabpy,"I love Elba's reaction to Peacemaker having the exact same tragic backstory as him. And then when they escape the military truck, all three muscly badasses strike the same pose with their guns and tight t shirts",oyxaam
h80fbh1,"I'm so glad Bloodsport also kept his mask for a VERY good chunk of time, he even put it on when he was without his full outfit and other realistic parts (about to drown? Put your tech helmet), these comic book characters sometimes have the coolest helmets but the actors gotta show the face and it sucks.",oyxaam
h7wb7fv,"No one gave a phoned in performance. Viola Davis was absolutely terrifying as Waller in this film. And she was already pretty scary in Suicide Squad. You knew deep down, that this Waller had no problem killing Bloodsport's daughter. That wasn't a threat. That was a promise.",oyxaam
h7yccbv,"Elba committed to the movie before it was even written, he and Gunn wrote his character after workshopping different villains, but he was already committed because he wanted to work with Gunn",oyxaam
h7ykq71,I didn't think their was a weak link in the cast. Even Pete Davidson played his part by getting his face blown off.,oyxaam
h7wcb2p,"I liked Peacemaker but I felt like him betraying the team was pretty obvious, it would have been a lot cooler if somebody else like Flagg or Bloodsport did it.",oyxaam
h7wkni0,I think that was Kaleidoscope?,oyxaam
h7w6nbf,The staff at Belle Reve and the ops center were amazing and they had the best turn of the movie. They saved thw whole squad and the world by knocking out Waller and directing the team to the fight.,oyxaam
h7wjucc,John Ostrander was huge influence. He played the doctor at the beginning who injects Savant. He is also the first name in the Thank You section of the credits,oyxaam
h7wa8b9,"> Ostrander 

I'm guessing you enjoyed his cameo in the movie?",oyxaam
h81jb9c,I actually interviewed Ostrander this morning. He was totally thrilled. Said it might be his favourite movie ever,oyxaam
h7wyp14,Yeah it’s a really nice contrast to shield to just see boring office workers who are just trying I get through the day. I loved it when Steve Agee’s character was excited about finding Luna because he’s just a hacker not an insane genius,oyxaam
h7xg2ws,With the last few marvel films and shows having people in chairs doing things as a tiringly boring trope. It was nice to see some life breathed into that part of the movie. The characters were cool and they didn't just fuck everything up for the team. They actually saved them!,oyxaam
h812urx,I liked that they still had a bunch of other Z-listers in the background. Like Calendar Man! And his joke is even tied into his gimmick!,oyxaam
h80cb4v,Lmfao them betting on who dies was so funny,oyxaam
h7wf61i,"When he said ""Bird"" is where he got me",oyxaam
h7w6nsi,King shark is baby.,oyxaam
h7x9xdt,"Stallone getting the biggest singular laugh of the movie is incredible and deserved, his performance was fantastic.",oyxaam
h7wdi4c,"It was so out of nowhere, funniest thing I’ve seen in a movie in a long time",oyxaam
h7xmf4v,That was Stallone's voice by the way. I was IMDB'ing the movie to see who PDM's mom's actress was and I saw his name come by. He's going the Groot route.,oyxaam
h7wbkbl,"My toddler says ""nom nom?"" every morning when he wakes up and wants breakfast. My toddler is king shark?",oyxaam
h846cdi,I paused the movie when it was revealed they killed the Freedom Fighters. I laughed for a good 5 mins lmao,oyxaam
h7x34ge,Pause? Is it available to rent?,oyxaam
h87980q,What about that sneaky kill he did on the one rebel. That was hilarious.,oyxaam
h8c43vf,Sylvester Stallone nailed it as Nanaue,oyxaam
h7w6vv0,"I appreciated that Harley, Boomer and Flagg all seemed to like and enjoy each others company, brief as it was.",oyxaam
h7vz7in,"I liked him getting killed in the first 5 minutes. Set the tone for the movie. Made it seem like no one was safe. 

I was actually more worried that the trailers were deceiving us by having him only in the shots with the B squad, and that he’d live the whole time.",oyxaam
h7wa6c1,"Im kind of sad he never really had a true face off with Flash minus the shitty last minute cameo for the first film, but the. I remembered we’re getting a Flashpoint movie and its very possible to bring him back.",oyxaam
h7w28tz,Honestly sucks that they killed him off. Would have loved to see him actually get a chance with a competent writer and director since Courtney is actually great in the role.,oyxaam
h7vz7gk,I was also sad that Milton had to die. He was just an innocent man trying to help the squad out. Wished we got to see more of Milton.,oyxaam
h7xuwvm,"all names are made of letters, dickhead.",oyxaam
h7vz97q,Was also great that he took the piss out of Blackguard so much before the mission.,oyxaam
h7vybl8,"Yeah it was a pity to see him die.

But, in a multiverse with gods, aliens and a man who can run at light speed, there's always a chance they could mumbo jumbo up a way for him to return.",oyxaam
h7wslcg,"Thats something James Gunn understands: If you have super-people, let them shine at least for a moment. Or dont, if they are just plain assholes like Blackguard. ;-)",oyxaam
h8135vr,"I was hoping he would come back in some really dumb way. 

Ya know

Like a",oyxaam
h7whb1p,"Lol that part was great, legit the most surprising one in the cast imo.

Internally I was praising the movie because the first thing we see him really do is throw his boomerangs as weapons, which I don't remember ever happening in a meaningful way in the first movie.

...aaand then the second thing we see him do is die horrifically. Chef's kiss.",oyxaam
h7y9ugl,The little ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ he gave as he died made it perfect for me,oyxaam
h7w1wzz,it might be the only thing i've like Jai Courtney in,oyxaam
h80g0we,Had to scroll very far down to see someone mention him lmao rip boomer,oyxaam
h7wouqr,I was hoping Jay could finally shine as this asshole... I was positively upset,oyxaam
h81jec7,"Honestly his casting as Boomer was so good, yet he was given absolutely nothing to do in the first film. I was really looking forward to this one having fun with him. His death hurt the most.",oyxaam
h7wjp4n,I made a bet with my friend that both Boomerang and Thinker would survive but Ratcatcher and Weasel would not. I owe him 20 bucks now. Shit would have gone up to 25 but even he didn't expect that Flag would go down.,oyxaam
h7yxjyn,He should have lived longer,oyxaam
i6m2rh4,"To be honest if I had to choose I would choose Flag to die instead of boomerang. Even though Flag was good in this movie, he still remains ""Generic good guy soldier dude"". Or it would have been better if they killed off one of the other cast members in the previous movie.

Boomerang could have died later, but the fact that people liked him despite the train wreck of a movie he was in makes him deserve a little bit more screen time.",oyxaam
h7wlkmk,"Thats the difference good writing makes. 

In the first one noone is really likable. Everyone is just plying cliche characters, everyone seemed souless. 

This one had character.",oyxaam
h7woe0b,That actor is great. I whole heatedly believe he's the only reason flag was brought back.,oyxaam
h7x46p8,"Goes to show sometimes it's not the actor, it's simply the shitty writing and script they're given. Joel Kimmaman did phenomenal in Altered Carbon though so I was excited to see he was coming back under Gunn.",oyxaam
h7wndkn,[deleted],oyxaam
h7wv5gc,"I mean...in the first movie, like, everyone is forgettable",oyxaam
h7wuil5,"Idk if it's just me but part of what made me sad is that it felt like they were building a romance between him and Harley, and I got excited thinking she could finally be with someone who cared about her",oyxaam
h8hje2p,"Gunn really went and twisted the knife with Flag's death. Was the heart shot really necessary? I wasn't prepared for that, it was extra and I can tell it was the intention. That beautiful bastard.",oyxaam
h80mg63,All except the guy we have been shown that sees his mom literally as everyone.  I only watched it once but I don't remember him calling anyone by their names.  Just Milton.  He meant something different to him.,oyxaam
h85ezpb,“Death”,oyxaam
h8ynb3d,i miss him,oyxaam
h7wksqj,She was terrifying. I was surprised she didn’t off her staff for what they did though.,oyxaam
h7zvk00,The fact I hate her character SO MUCH is a testament to how good she is,oyxaam
h7zuit9,"Honestly every scene she’s in is hers, constantly stealing the scenes",oyxaam
h80b8n2,The drool from her mouth in the end before she was knocked out was perfect!,oyxaam
h88qax9,I am so glad they brought back the actors from the previous film. They were far from being the issue there.,oyxaam
h7w15ms,"I’m really curious how much this one would have made if it came out when the original did. With the hard R rating, balls to the wall premise and characters, it would’ve be interesting.",oyxaam
h7w3hi9,"is it safe to call this the best dceu movie? has the combination of good writing, heart, and spectacle not many of the others can match",oyxaam
h7zdv6s,The DC movie we deserve.,oyxaam
h7w6b9s,Just fucking amazing.,oyxaam
h80o85r,I can't see a single soul saying the Ayer movie was better.,oyxaam
h7wyyus,"The first one wasnt bad. I have no problem dying on the hill to defend it to some extend. It was a fun movie with interesting characters and a lot of potential. The finale was kinda weak, but A LOT of superhero movies have problems with that, including the Marvel movies.

But yeah, this new Suicid Squad movie was pretty great. Want more of that.",oyxaam
h819vec,THE Suicide Squad movie,oyxaam
hb37cex,So that's what we are huh...some sort of suicide squad we deserve...,oyxaam
hggrgpp,Yeah what a fucking redemption comeback of that 2016 shitshow we'll all pretend never happened,oyxaam
h7vztai,he was CRYING ??? i seriously thought he was just hanging out a little bummed but that makes it so much sadder omg,oyxaam
h7w1lsv,"dude that was the saddest thing I've ever seen

you can also see him crying after he falls out of jotunheim later on",oyxaam
h7w2wga,[deleted],oyxaam
h7xk1q9,There's also the scene where he's looking out of the van at the couple kissing that just tugs at the heart.  He just wants to fit in.,oyxaam
h7w6pot,They did a really job making every character relatable in a way.,oyxaam
h7wo76q,That shark was seriously one of the best parts of the movie next to Harley Quinn of course. His weird delivery of lines is so funny. Like when they are on a mission and he’s like “bird.”,oyxaam
h7wh22j,I was really worried the fish were going to kill him. That would have been too tragic for him to go out like that.,oyxaam
h7w663u,"i didn’t see him crying, he’s just chillin in the van",oyxaam
h7wqeac,"James Gunn is the same director who made us care for a tree that could only say 3 words. Well, >!~~4~~ 5 words!<.",oyxaam
h7wjure,"I can't believe that essentially a cartoon voiced by Sylvester Stallone, in a hypervioent popcorn movie, could be so touching.",oyxaam
h7whf3s,I woulda stayed in the Van with Nanaue to keep him company.,oyxaam
h7xmh3m,[deleted],oyxaam
h7xig6h,"That scene with the alien fish was so well put together. The music, the tone the lighting. The undertone of the fish not liking King Shark but rather trying to eat him.",oyxaam
h869y35,Was he? I rewatched and saw no tears...I thought he was just bobbing his head to music from the club..,oyxaam
h811vot,I audibly went “aww...” and got genuinely sad. He just wanted to be with his friends!,oyxaam
h82qo2c,"I had no idea he was crying and reading that he was literally made me tear up. James Gunn did an AMAZING job at making me feel so much for a giant, land walking, man eating shark.",oyxaam
h7y4hc0,"And then immediately make it sad, because all Starro wanted to do was float in space and look at the stars. :'(",oyxaam
h7xstcd,"I loved it. It clicked early on that Harley was gonna stab that starfish with the javelin. But I liked that it was to let the rats get in and do the damage.

The scene of her floating was so pretty but fucked up and weird!",oyxaam
h7wqdts,Starfish is slang for a butthole. Does that apply here?,oyxaam
h7xsuy6,The score for that moment is fantastic.,oyxaam
h7zq0o6,Yes,oyxaam
hggrhtt,I still considered it fuckin disgusting what are ya all on about,oyxaam
h7x5odz,"Tbh I didn't even see her in any of the trailers so when she turned up in the film I expected her to be killed off quickly

Now I need her & Sebastian in future films sooo bad",oyxaam
h7x8m42,"You know how you can tell this was a great ensemble movie?

Every character in the actual main cast deserves to be a “favorite” character in their own way.",oyxaam
h7wn9pl,I honestly loved them all. Such great lines all around.,oyxaam
h7x11gv,Agreed! And I’m so glad her little rat buddy survived till the end.,oyxaam
h80kc8l,"Thoroughly agree. At that online media event DC did last year, Gunn said Ratcatcher 2 was his favorite. I was like ""What? Played by who?"" but lo, he was totally right. She was outstanding.",oyxaam
h818u13,She looked stunning in the bar,oyxaam
h8gzzce,I fell in love hard.,oyxaam
h86y4c6,I want a King Shark + Ratcatcher 2 spinoff.,oyxaam
h7xusgp,"At first i was like"" man is this another feminism type character? James you are better than this"" and than latter on i absolutely love her",oyxaam
h7w62c3,I need Sebastian,oyxaam
h7wcjsv,Sideshow collectibles 1:1 scale Sebastian has to be on the way,oyxaam
h806knk,I still want to know what Sebastian kept in his tiny backpack.,oyxaam
h7xx69o,I need a plushie of Sebastian,oyxaam
h7xxvoe,lemme get a Milton,oyxaam
h7zq91d,I need one of Ratcatcher and Sebastian one that preferably waves at me,oyxaam
h7wod8f,"you could probably find one in your basement, just freeze it and glue it to a stand, voila",oyxaam
h7wb9jy,And a lot darker,oyxaam
h7x6deb,Gunn is better without the shackles of Disney. He should get that Marvel money but the man needs to be unleashed in R Rated films.,oyxaam
h7we49g,"And I thought the movie felt very different from GotG (ie: very little music), which is impressive, and kind of hilarious because the first had obvious attempts to copy GotG's style.",oyxaam
h83lnru,"The movie was almost Rick and Morty level of crazy, loved it.",oyxaam
h7w3cqe,"The whole action sequence feels so wrong, and then you see flag relaxing in the camp and it hits you.",oyxaam
h7w4nnf,"The way they just stare blankly and then finally are like ""nah, we didn't see anyone."" 

Holy shit. That was good.",oyxaam
h7w1rsj,Just hand over the DCEU to Gunn.,oyxaam
h7w2ar0,Mine too. Moments like that are why I love the theatrical experience.,oyxaam
h7wij47,The awkwardness of the scene was just spot on,oyxaam
h814tr5,"Hand the keys to the DCEU over to James Gunn, this has been the best entry yet. Between this and the Guardians movies, the man's shown he knows how to handle an ensemble cast and treat characters properly. I'm fully sold.

Also, I need to see more of Sean Gunn as Calendar Man. I *need* it.",oyxaam
h7w87ya,It’s just like in Predator!,oyxaam
h7y9znw,It was like a twisted version of the attack on the rebel camp in Predator,oyxaam
h7wtyiy,Just hand all the DC stuff to James. He's so much better than Zack that it's painful.,oyxaam
h7wmhcd,He fuckin nailed it. This has been a fun move to watch. Capital letters FUN I say!,oyxaam
h7wh53u,my god I loved that and so did my theater!!!,oyxaam
h7wwm6v,Hand the whole dc cinematic universe to gun.,oyxaam
h7xgt73,The rumor is that after about a week of shooting this movie DC locked Gunn down and handed him the next Justice League film.,oyxaam
h7xo4tb,Why not just the whole DCEU?  Let him Feige it?,oyxaam
h803yiu,Hand the whole DC universe over to him. I want James Gunn Superman so bad.,oyxaam
h83a7b7,"remove snyder, insert james gunn. I know it won't happen cuz disney realized they effed up and are gonna hold onto the man for an eternity now...",oyxaam
h84geha,"When the camp tower fell down, why can't Flag hear it? That would be loud.",oyxaam
h8571f7,Just hand the keys to the DCEU to James Gunn. I wished he had been in charge from the beginning instead of Snyder.,oyxaam
h7wmiz2,"Just no, the movie was bad.",oyxaam
h7vy7ku,[deleted],oyxaam
h7w65bi,"Never really been a fan of John Cena’s acting, but he absolutely killed it in this",oyxaam
h7wknpi,The only thing that bugged me was Waller’s people  being like “oh you’re not gonna kill a kid right?” I assumed these people worked with Waller a lot so they’d have some idea of who she is. Everything else was amazing,oyxaam

h7wk0co,Understatement of the decade. Goes to show what the right hands can do with the right tools. I'm so happy Suicide Squad got this iteration and not the absolute disaster that was that first film,oyxaam
h7wi4v9,"I was blown away by EVERY actor so far and I'm only an hour into it. This is streets ahead better than the first attempt!

EDIT: I haven't nearly finished the movie, but my favorite character is King Shark so far. I am biased because I love sharks but still, I love him.

EDIT EDIT: Also at 1:08 into the movie, Columbian J.K.Simmons makes an appearance. He looks just like J.K Simmons from the Future War lol.",oyxaam
h7w9taa,Better than the *Oscar winning* Suicide Squad?,oyxaam
h7wb6jw,He was pretty fucking funny,oyxaam
h7x9i4p,I'm more and more impressed by Cena as an actor,oyxaam
h7z3cjx,"Hear me out... but if anyone could make a successful remake of the Police Squad/Naked Gun series, it'd be Cena.",oyxaam

h818wu7,It’s kind of baffling how much better it is. It eclipses the first in every single way,oyxaam
h858shq,This movie obliterated the original. It rendered it utterly and completely irrelevant.,oyxaam
h8mc43c,I’m being serious when I say this film might go down as one of the greatest sequel improvements of all time.,oyxaam

h8fqe96,"I think it’s my favorite DC movie.

It’s like devouring a limited run comic miniseries in an afternoon. I love how each chapter has a different feel, tone and focus. 

Parental advisory, obviously. Imagine “Mystery Men” but rebooted by Paul Verhoeven. Like “Robocop”, the violence is meant to elicit a visceral audience response, but also to make a point. In this case, that the only thing “clean” or “efficient” about the various real world military adventures we watch through our devices is the way their true aims and consequences are kept from us.",oyxaam
h7wh2f2,"Someone pointed out that Waller wanted Rick and Harley to die because last time they disobeyed orders. Walters orders were to kill everyone, but there was no way she didn’t know those people were rebels. So she wanted Rick dead and the resistance to also be killed. If the resistance takes over the US government can’t put in one of their own.",oyxaam

h813mug,"Well, the whole speech she gives General Luna after she shoots him explaining why she has to ""end"" her toxic relationships is pretty fucking hilarious.",oyxaam
h7ycatc,That was probably the intention of the writers but it actually makes no sense to me. The reason they were doing this is the old government was friendly with America. Aren’t these rebels the same remnants of the old government?,oyxaam
h964zdj,It was the opposite for me. Harley Quinn's scenes were the weakest part of the entire movie. Seems like she had her own movie going on and it didn't feel like it matched the rest of the movie.,oyxaam

Birds of Prey did the same. Its a great addition!",oyxaam

I thoroughly enjoyed it too, but I personally thought it could've stood to shave off 20-30 minutes. The whole Harley detour was kind of pointless to the plot and seemed like a blatant reason to justify her inclusion in this movie (and its advertising). Though her killing everyone to escape was super badass. The backstory with Starro was kind of meh when you know it was just necessary exposition to set up a big kaiju fight and you just want to get to the fireworks factory already. And I didn't love the Flag vs Peacemaker fight because Flag's anti-government turn seemed to come out of nowhere (especially when taking into account his character in the 2016 movie).

I too felt bad for Starro. He was peaceful in Space, only to be captured and tortured for 30 years. His ultimate choice of revenge was understandable and yet you can understand how he got there. ~~David~~ Peter Capaldi's regret at the end was beautiful acting too.

To be fair she's been shown to be highly effective in combat in her other films, the difference here is that Gunn directed it so well. I'm not sure what it is but in her other films she just kinda seems like she has plot armor while here everything seemed more natural. I can't put my finger on it exactly but it was just different.

I will also point out that her action at the beginning of the movie was very similar to her action in other films so I was nervous that her role here was going to be just as bad, glad that wasn't the case.

>I realized while watching I really wanted the entire core team to survive and was on edge at the thought of them dying, something the first iteration didn’t do in any sort of way.

Yup, totally agree. I would say the only guys that sorta had you rooting for them in the original was Diablo and Deadshot but not in a seriously invested kinda way. In this film I was honestly hoping king shark and polka dot man would survive, they really stood out as likable characters.",oyxaam

I think they kinda fucked up there, because she's traditionally a Jack Sparrow character as opposed to a Jason Bourne.

And while wolf was great, oh my god i love her as Harley. Before her i really didn’t know if they’d ever get someone who could nail that role. But my god Margot 10/10 in this. I cannot wait for the next one. Her escape scene was probably my favorite of the movie",oyxaam
h88ns4d,"It's really great how his character gets built up through lots of little scenes showing just how sadistic he is.

And then he kills Flag you can see that Flags last words really hit him.

And then the scene where he's about to kill Ratcatcher 2 and she asks him why and you can see he's just searching for a reason to justify it.",oyxaam

Omg what they're making a show? Fuck yeah 

Lmao and the casting choice was brilliant love that actor",oyxaam

And it finishes off with him saying that was happy just floating in space and staring at the stars... Fuck.",oyxaam
h7wrotc,"So many stylistic choices in this movie were amazing and instantly memorable. Can't list them all, but the rain scene, the Ratcatcher 1 flashbacks, Bloodsport falling through the floors, the Polka Dot body horror, the Starro facehugger horror, the entire team 1 scene, when Harley escapes/kills everyone surrounded by colorful flourishes, and all the ways they announced the different acts were standouts.",oyxaam
h7wk8z2,"""It's byooteeful!""",oyxaam
h7wpb41,Beautifully horrifying,oyxaam
h7wi0b4,"Yes, and it was my favorite kill of the movie. Just beautiful. I loved the Birds of Prey prison fight but this shit was on an entirely different level. Gunn really let Harley loose and it was awesome to see her have that entire sequence (that equally showed her insanity with the POV shots).",oyxaam

2 GOTG2 was so imperfect, but fuck it really was great. i hated the stupid jokes at first but if you just consider it like how friends and family make stupid jokes all the time, and you laugh cause you love them, then it makes perfect sense.",oyxaam
h7wkgz8,"Honestly, Gunn managed to do subverting expectations the right way.

You think X? Nope Y. Soandso is safe? Nope. 

And the key thing is it makes sense. Who the fuck is going to succeed in torturing Harley Quinn of all people? There is a version of this where she probably got off on it. Waller is seriously fucked, of course, she has a B team and a fallback plan.",oyxaam

I know he shows up later, but it made me laugh. 

Great movie BTW.",oyxaam
h7x1rp2,"As you said it has good emotional moments and all these scenes were given those few extra seconds at the end for it to breathe instead of cutting to the next topic quickly 

I truly hate it when MCU makes a joke at the end of an emotional/epic scene. In GotG 2, when the whole team makes a pose, the theme music is blasting, the camera turns and zooms out for this epic moment, and then a Fucking rock falls on batista. The whole moment is ruined. To top it all off, someone makes a dumb joke on this. 

I just never understood why they do this. In SS, there's similar kind of scene where Harley Quinn escapes herself and the team's plan were for nothing. But here it was actually funny, and more importantly this whole scene was build up for this exact joke. While in GotG 2, the humor is Fucking up an earned epic moment of a previous task. 

This is my favourite Gunn movie yet. I love GotG 1. But didn't like GotG 2. I had a lot of gripes with that movie. Hopefully he nails GotG 3.


Can't wait for his next non franchise movie.",oyxaam

Definitely but it really didn't have much competition. If I were to rank the movies I'd go:

* The Suicide Squad: 8/10

* Wonder Woman: 7/10

* Man of Steel: 7/10

* Aquaman: 6.5/10

h7w9kqv,I don't know if it's the acting but I felt like Rick Flagg's final words actually cut through Peacemaker's fanatacism just a little bit.  He didn't cut all the way through but just enough that it's noticeable.,oyxaam

h7wlgds,">John Cena is officially on the same level of The Rock and Batista

Man, I gotta say that both Cena and Batista are waaaaaayyy better actors than The Rock, or, at the very least, are significantly better character actors. The Rock just always seems like he's playing the rock -- he is the spectacle, not the role. Cena was fucking TERRIFYING in this movie, but gave it such subtle hints of honesty and goodness: he didn't want to kill Flag, or Ratcatcher, but he is thorough, he's good at his job, and he loves America.

And don't even get me started on Batista. Big Dave is one of the best big name character actors in Hollywood rn.",oyxaam
h7w0bnh,I always thought John Cena in WWE during his peak was more charismatic and better than the Rock in terms of his mic skills.,oyxaam

h7whbpn,"> That shot with Flag and Peacemaker fighting and it was all in Peacemaker’s helmet. Fucking phenomenal!

There were so many great shots throughout this.  A couple of the more subtle ones that stood out to me were the one where the scientist is splattered onto a window and then the camera pulls back and that's the background of Peacemaker (or someone) as a new scene starts and the end credits Weasel scene where he gets up with the camera starting as a closeup on him and pulls out to a wide shot as he runs off into the jungle.",oyxaam

Examples: 

Incredible hulk (Hulk stabbed with Abominations elbow bone), BvS (Superman and Doomsday getting speared), Infinity War (Gamorra stabbing Thanos, Thanos stabbing Iron man, Thanos getting hit with Stormbreaker), Thor Ragnarok (Hulk getting bit by Fenrir), Chronicle (Antagonist getting speared at the end), Pacific Rim (The Kaiju sword), Invincible (Robo-zombie getting stabbed by Invicible), etc.

In *Birds of Prey*, there were no tiny boy shorts, but still lots of skin.

Shame they try to kill him but oh well",oyxaam
h87ja9u,i want to see more of King Shark!,oyxaam
h885kid,"Being able to clearly hear Rick as he whispered the ""what a joke"" line was almost jarring because I'm so used to struggling to hear whispered dialogue haha.",oyxaam
h8aam68,"I was curious on that too. The thinker did say they were basically corpses underneath, but wasn't sure if Starro dying released them. Seems like the probes that connected Starro to the host did pretty good damage based on the limited view from the ""testing"" the thinker did.",oyxaam
h8e60nj,"I think Peacemaker was just talking shit and saying he *could* use a smaller bullet, but actually doesn't. Something something symbolism, something something peace and freedom, something something US military.",oyxaam
h8gkwu5,"Just looking at Elba's variety of weapons, it makes sense that he's got different sized bullets. Cena was shit talking him, and Elba wasn't going to give up any of his tricks, or like he mentions later his liabilities.",oyxaam
h8ffb2y,"What you missed was that it was a pissing contest. That smaller bullets line was basically the equivalent of ""I have a dinosaur that eats forcefield dogs""",oyxaam
h8nfjxx,"Peacemaker worked because it didn't work. Like it's such a garish and ugly costume but they just play it completely straight. They only acknowledge the dumb helmet once. 

It help sell the idea that peacemaker is kind of insane.",oyxaam
h95my3x,A masterpiece,oyxaam
h9dd9ns,Art,oyxaam
h7x2szq,and then disney rehired him back anyway. and hopefully after this marvel gives him even more creative freedom on guardians 3 although this will be hard to top in terms of sheer spectacle,oyxaam
h7wjsel,"Thanks, butterfly effect!",oyxaam
h80b9yv,"I mean the Starfish controlled people could qualify, but it definitely is not filling the same trope you’re talking about. Also the effects in this movie don’t look as cheap as others so it helps",oyxaam
h80oet2,No sky beam either,oyxaam
h837m4q,"Yeah, that was definitely a part of it. The rebel leader's speech after Bloodsport and Peacemaker kill all her troops, and The Thinker's speech are both very much about American interventionalism",oyxaam
h83eb64,Brutally direct yea. Almost to the point that I had the thought of how there could be people upset by it,oyxaam
h8379jm,"Enters a country, destabilizes it for it's own purpose, then years later blows everything up to cover it up... Yeah...",oyxaam
h85kzzc,There is absolutely no need to compare these two wildly different directors but I respect your opinion,oyxaam
h85e7do,What's really funny is that Gunn wrote the Dawn of the Dead remake that Snyder directed.,oyxaam
h85frp2,"This isn’t unpopular, are you smoking crack?",oyxaam
h8dkoq7,">Team B were the sacrificial lambs full of people who were, in Waller's mind, useless abilities wise (TKD, Weasel, Javelin), Traitors only out for themselves (Blackguard), cowards who would run (Savant), liabilities too crazy/stupid to control (Mongal, Harley, Boomerang), and a man who would have never gone through with the plan if told the whole story (Flagg).

Love the analysis. I only saw them as ""useless"" but this made more sense overall. Harely is probably like a roach Waller wants dead but keep surviving.",oyxaam
h85v2md,"i’m surprised they were “allowed” to do that, lol. i doubt disney would let marvel ever",oyxaam
h867ds7,"Black Panther was critical of white imperialism, Falcon and the Winter Soldier was critical of US racism and the US’s actions as a police state.",oyxaam
h85v0ks,Wow us government does something shady in a movie. That’s not that big.,oyxaam
h89ty6t,Woo US bad kinda crap we get it. Its getting tiresome at this point since we don't do that sort of stuff anymore.,oyxaam
h7vygns,"Its only available to stream on HBOMAX in US.

h7xdiwx,Try downloading Opera browser and switch the VPN location to us,oyxaam
h8b8p3h,It should come to Crave.,oyxaam
h7w78zw,It’s definitely set after the first Suicide Squad but you miss very little by not seeing it.  They do a good job of establishing what you would need from the first film (which is honestly just relationships between characters that were in the first movie).,oyxaam
h7w70so,It is a sequel and a reboot lol. Watch it and you'll understand.,oyxaam
h7zkehj,Oh I highly doubt there will be no consequences. Waller isn't someone who is going to straight up murder you. She engineers situations to get her results. All of them are on a list. Trust. Lol.,oyxaam
h7y6vth,They probably have a secret hard drive too.,oyxaam
h80h3m1,"I’d wager it was something like this:


James Gunn: Hey John Cena, do you want to be in The Suicide Squad? We'll pay you a buncha money


John Cena: Yes",oyxaam
h80j8z7,I loved how it looked almost adorable and you feel sorry for it even though you’ve been explicitly told it ate 27 kids. Great CGI work.,oyxaam
h80sxx6,"When he was hugging her and it cut to Harley and Bloodsport I really thought when they looked back Ratcatcher 2 would be gone and they're just like ""Where'd she go?"" and King Shark burps or something.",oyxaam

h84z7fd,Does anybody have a link to watch the movie without HBO Max or anything like that?,oyxaam

h8162qs,She's basically the head of the CIA but for superheroes. She's meant to be scum of the earth,oyxaam
h81efkk,That's how she is.,oyxaam
h82o0yc,She's good at her job. It's just that her job isn't about doing good.,oyxaam
h81jenw,Did you see the after credits scene?,oyxaam
h83a53e,There was a surprising amount of bird killing in this movie.,oyxaam
h837tjk,"You have the bird in the ball court, the one on Savants head, and the parrot aviary, oh, and King Shark's pigeon.

Is that a lot?",oyxaam
h88u6v6,Yeah that's called a motif,oyxaam
h84098q,"If you left the first movie feeling empty, I envy you. I was furious.",oyxaam
h83vojk,100% it also resonated with peacemaker. He really didn't want to kill Flagg.,oyxaam
h83xzze,Yeah I think that could’ve been the subtext,oyxaam
h84nudj,Honestly I noticed a lot of references in this movie. One that sticks out in my mind is the matrix reference with Harley,oyxaam
h85mgzv,"same. Loved that they actually felt like characters, but also the audience at the same time since they were watching and reacting to all the same stuff we were.",oyxaam
h89u7ix,I wonder if the CIA admin in HQ would be doing the same shit with their own covert operations and operatives irl.,oyxaam
h8865p5,"Honestly I do think people overstate how bad other DC movies are

I think Man Of Steel is pretty boring, but Batman V Superman is an interesting movie that gets too much hate. Its worth watching for Ben Affleck's Batman imo. Its messier than the Snyder Cut (plot is stupid convoluted when you think about it) but still a decent film. Its just not a good ""versus"" movie.",oyxaam
h87ipel,"No, you haven’t avoided most of the bad ones, you’ve just liked them for some reason.",oyxaam
h88aajk,based on the end credit scene she's going to torture them with bad assignments. She's probably going to make them wish she had just fired them.,oyxaam
h88gukg,"I mean, how else can ""had his way with me"" be taken? It's either the Starro victims, Starro itself, or both.",oyxaam
h898dyd,"I didn't catch his response, just that he was being smarmy about it.",oyxaam
h898bcn,"Flag I thought was the best character, but I don't know how characteristic his turn against Waller was.  From my vague recollection of the first movie his values felt in line with hers. 

Peacemaker was a blatant satirical teardown of ""This is what Captain America would be if he were created today"" and while they aren't necessarily wrong I don't think it deserves best character.",oyxaam
h8a0hva,Deadshot has entered the chat,oyxaam
h8d12ng,"He disobeyed her in the first film, so did harley quinn",oyxaam
h8d5sya,"She could not fully trust him, so he was expendable. Team 1 needed to look legit so thats why she put him there",oyxaam
h8d3s0t,She most likely put everyone in the first team to die as a distraction.,oyxaam
h8efwnj,"Well Taika was also in the movie so could’ve been a homage I guess, probably just a coincidence though",oyxaam
h8mvcm6,"Bloodsport says he doesn't want anyone to know his weaknesses or have anything to use against him, so it seems like nobody except him knows he's scared of rats.

Waller doesn't need to know if Weasel can swim or not. That whole team was just cannon fodder to distract the soldiers from the other team and were completely expendable.",oyxaam
h8l1u0z,I assume she wanted the rebels dead too. And she likely felt confident they’d have an answer to Starro.,oyxaam
h8m82ir,I think Waller probably intended for the whole A team to be wiped out. She wanted all those villains dead for whatever reason.,oyxaam
h8pnawu,"The first team was meant to die, she probably knew Weasel couldn't swim. She also meant for them to kill the rebels.",oyxaam
h8k7e44,">Assuming Flag has been captured by the enemy and ordering the extermination of what would be allies.

All Waller wanted to do was cover up starro. If she felt these rebels were a threat to expose that secret, she would want them dead as well. That might not have been an accident.",oyxaam
h95nxs2,Yes. Yes he did.,oyxaam
h94bl69,I feel exactly the same about who lived and died.,oyxaam
h95u4rt,The guy who edited this movie also edited Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. He said when editing he could tell that they didn't use a stunt double because he saw Margot Robbie's feet so often while editing the other movie that they're instantly recognisable to him.,oyxaam
h84tkqo,Agreed. Something was missing.,oyxaam
h84ssx2,"Sometimes the pacing just don't vibe or narrative structure with the flashbacks and some scene taking a little longer than they should. I had the same energy watching GOTG 2 and Thor Ragnarok, but they are easily my favorite films now after you get over those vibes and the creme rises to the top and film making stands out.",oyxaam
h850jts,"I think it was a bit too overstuffed. There were backstories for all the major characters, all the stuff happening with Corto Maltese, Walker’s staff, the experimentation on Starro, and then Starro himself. I think it could have benefitted from a little streamlining of the plot.",oyxaam
h7vy6xk,Peacemaker :(,oyxaam
h7vyzu9,Peacemaker.,oyxaam
h7wdgra,"Peacemaker, he's got a show on HBO next year",oyxaam
h7wc0dd,I do love the King Shark from the Harley Quinn show but I think Stallone absolutely nailed what they were trying to do here,oyxaam
h7wcvjw,King shark is a completely different character in every iteration lol. He's hilariously inconsistent. But yeah the Harley Quinn iteration is the best one but this a close second for me,oyxaam
h7w4ecu,">Harley is obviously a given

Is there another birds of prey?",oyxaam
h82ub2t,Flula Borg is such a hidden gem. Every time he was on Conan he was fucking hilarious. I’d watch an entire movie of that guy narrating paint dry.,oyxaam
h7w0y8o,"I'd agree that this may be the best DCEU movie. Which is fitting seeing that Suicide Squad is the worst, IMO.",oyxaam
h7wd95k,"It has wonder woman 1, Shazam, Birds of Prey, etc. The bar wasn't really low but it blew it out of the water for sure.",oyxaam
h7wm1du,">	Really made me wish Marvel would do an R rated movie, because it’s a whole different ballgame when you get that freedom. Maybe with Deadpool, but we’ll see.

I think they already confirmed the next Deadpool is going to be rated R so your wish will probably come true.",oyxaam
h81zcpm,"at first i thought you said “i can’t recommend seeing this in theatres, though” and wondered what you had against the big screen after such a glowing review. i got impatient and watched on HBO but will definitely go see it in the theater too",oyxaam
h7w3e9p,By “eye candy” you mean Weasel right?,oyxaam
h7w3gls,">Not gonna lie kinda mad they killed the eye candy.

Who, Savant?",oyxaam
h7ywalq,"Crazy they gave her an incredibly deep monologue, really wasn't expecting that out of her. Such a massive contrast to her writing in the first movie",oyxaam
h8czo3c,And James Gunn says the lock bit was all her.,oyxaam
h7wkfxo,"Followed up with a hilarious double beat when he tells Polka Dot Man ""that's your mom.""",oyxaam
h7xjfe8,Honestly that whole scene reminded me of Avengers 1 where Cap was giving everyone orders.,oyxaam
h7wqk0b,I think it was just the way he had it arranged in his tight whites.,oyxaam

h7x7sel,"There was a guy about 3 seats away from me and when it panned up and towards the action right after the Jotunheim card this guy, pretty damn loudly, goes 'THAT SHIT IS SO GANGSTER.'

Turns out they were all true and found himself forced to go along because even he had something Waller could control him with and that was June Moon aka the Enchantress.,oyxaam

The scene between rat collector 2 and bloodsport where she shares about her dad and he explains why he fears rats was played totally straight. A heart to heart. I was waiting for that annoying joke or something from one of the other characters but it didn't happen. And I loved it more because of that!

Not taking itself seriously most of the time let's the serious moments land all the better",oyxaam
h7xdkuo,This is by far the worst take I’ve seen in this thread. Marvel doesn’t take anything seriously. Every couple minutes there’s a quip from literally every character. Every serious moment is undercut with a joke. Im genuinely astounded that someone thinks they’re too serious.,oyxaam

h7xy2hg,the perfect tone for Starro,oyxaam
h80dcjs,This is what he movies should be. Comedy instead of trying to be Christopher Nolan,oyxaam

h7zdp76,"I still enjoyed the movie a lot but I could think of several jokes that didnt land very well:
The shot of the squad looking like Polka Dot’s mom.
The fake mustache shark joke.
The eating dicks joke by Cena. 

Polka Dot Man was pretty funny though.",oyxaam
h8qoyeq,It was a weird mix of boomer humor (haha millennials bad) and dick jokes that just felt incredibly juvenile. I was insulted,oyxaam
h7wqj7k,To add to this - it was very formulaic. The joke would be set up with time for it to land. I didn't watch this in the cinema. I watched it on HBO. I wonder if it's obvious that they're waiting on audience reaction in theaters as it is at home. It's jarring. Like the polkadot mom gag. Or the rat waving gag. It was very distracting.,oyxaam
h7w2oj1,"A lot of the jokes were peoples faces exploding or dying in other brutal ways. Not particularly funny. I'm not opposed to gore the Thing is a favorite of mine but it's supposed to be shocking and strange, a specticle of morbid curiosity. When its played for laughs it's goes from ew that's crazy to what the fuck is wrong with us? This level of violence and I am expected to laugh? Like the reaction they expect is ""he was just shot in the face and his head exploded haha so random""",oyxaam

Have you guys ever picked up a Suicide Squad comic or thought about the general idea of what you signed up to watch? You can’t hate the thing for following through on its promises. 

The movie was a lot of fun. They could have cut 15-20 mins of it, sure. But the rest of it was so balls to the wall crazy that I didn’t mind too much. The ratcatcher 2 story had a lot of heart. All the actors came to play. King shark was endearing. The Idris Elba / John Cena rivalry was excellent the whole movie. The action scenes were everything you could want. The deaths were impactful when you wanted them to be. The jokes were rapid fire, but in my opinion, they hit more than they missed. It was just a good time. Does it deserve an oscar?

I liked Harley, Ratcatcher 2 (the like 15 seconds of Taika as Ratcatcher 1), and King Shark and I really didn't give a shit about or enjoy spending time with any of the other characters.  The humor was mostly ""extreme violence lol"" (a lot of which was very predictable, I rolled my eyes when Polka-Dot Man died) which I haven't found funny or entertaining since like season 1 of Rick and Morty.  The Polka-Dot Man's mom running joke might be one of my least favorite jokes ever in a movie (I honestly wasn't even sure if it was supposed to be funny) and having her look like a fatter version of a stereotypical Karen kind of rubbed me the wrong way.  There's none of the heart, humor, or visuals that made me enjoy GotG (even when comparing it to Birds of Prey, that feels like a major upgrade compared to this) that I kept waiting to kick in but never did.  It's better than the first Suicide Squad, but honestly if someone asked me if I would rather rewatch the first one or this one I would say the first one because it's at least entertaining with how inept it is and how every choice is so wrong.  

If you enjoyed this one, I'm honestly really jealous because I went into it wanting to fucking love it.  Just goes to show how subjective art really is",oyxaam
h849nit,"I feel the same way. The pacing was awful, way too long and so much could have been edited out.

The funny jokes on top of the insane violence and gore just didn't work for me. It was a clash in tone that was so off. Go one way or the other, humor or gore but not both.

Individual scenes were good, there were plenty of funny jokes but ultimately the plot was nonsense.

No but it's not trying to be, it's a bunch of nobody super villains from comic books brought to life and shown how silly they are but in interesting or funny ways.

The freedom fighter scene felt like it was just a lot more than it needed to be. The joke would have been just as good with killing only a few guards or innocent people.

&#x200B;

Felt like it tried to be a lot of things (funny, emotional, ironic), and *almost* got there, like really close, but never really achieved any of those. It felt fine. I thought the ""moral"" or whatever was portrayed well. Other than that... meh.

- It completely went downhill when they introducted the Harley subplot followed by some dragged on scenes. Literally an hour of nothing happening.
- They went overboard with the gore. I get that they wanted to put the R rating to use but it was like ""hey let's see how far we can go and show as much gore as possible"".

>It felt like DC tried to ""copy"" the Marvel formula and just overshot it to the point of it looking like a poorly made parody

I don't know Gunn's intent but I basically viewed it as a super hero movie satire. Some of the subverted tropes, like them steamrolling the freedom fighter camp cracked me up.

I don't think it was too long, it was only a bit over two hours, I think. But the movie was draining and I had to watch it in 15 to 30 minute chunks. It was like a really rich piece of cake. Eating a lot in one sitting was too much but great to nibble on.

>Every character is invincible and there are no real stakes to anything. 

This is the one comment I have to strongly take issue with. They killed off a lot of characters and not just disposable red shirts. Up until 30 seconds before the polka dot guy got killed, I figured he was safe and had plot armor (as soon as he started celebrating I knew he was dead).

Boomerang guy seemed like he'd be around for a few more movies as a side character. Same with Savant and especially Flagg.",oyxaam

I agree this was probably 15-20 mins too long though, at times it felt a little indulgent.  I didn’t really care for the final battle scene with the starfish and how it met it’s demise with the rats, it just wasn’t satisfying or fun.  The rat girl wasn’t that pivotal of a role to the overall story for that ending to really hit.  Also, they tried to go for a nice moment with Elba and the daughter at the end but that felt shoehorned in, they just had the one scene together in the beginning, so the ending with them also didn’t feel totally earned.  The earlier scene with the daughter was kind of funny, but I didn’t envision from that she would tear up watching her dad on tv help stop a monster.

havw47p,"> Q1) I've seen about 4 - 6 comments here saying that Thinker abused Starro. Where in the movie was this illustrated or stated? (The audio is a little unclear, and where I'm from, subtitles are in Mandarin, so if a character's voice was muffled, I pray that I somehow can read the Mandarin subtitles)

All of Starro is one being, meaning it feels all the pain of those with the smaller starfishes on their faces, the ones that Thinker was torturing and abusing. When Ratcatcher 2 is watching in terror Starro also says something like ""He tortured us... had his way with us"" and Thinker gives a smile and shrug, which has a clear and dark implication

> Q2) Re: when Bloodsport shot Peacemaker, it showed a zoomed in illustration of how Bloodsport's bullet went through, I don't understand what I'm supposed to make out of it? Small bullets are better?

There's no real/complex reason why Bloodsport's bullets were stronger other than something to do with aim, but it was a call back to the ""smaller bullets"" conversation from the start of the movie, and proving Bloodsport as the better marksman

> Q3) At the scene where Thinker is showing that apart from locals he used ""Journalists, Political rivals."" Apart from their faces also stucked with a mini Starro, why are their bodies torn apart bleeding? They look semi alive

Part of the Q1 answer, but because they are alive since they're connected to Starro

> Q4) How did Thinker keep(housed) Starro? I legitimately thought there was lava / in a volcano action going on.

No specific answer with this, but it can be assumed he thought of some sort of containment as Starro slowly got bigger

> Q5) When Nanaue/King Shark was enchanted by the aquarium with its ""New Dumb friends"", why were they also following him around as Nananue/King Shark jumped around?

Another that might not be too satisfying of an answer, but simply because the animals behaved that way. Also seen the theory that they were ""sizing him up""

> Q6) So sad about Flag's death, why didn't he shoot Peacemaker? Or realistically, fake it. Pretend that he did not want to share the clip. Say smth like ""You're right, for peace, I shan't share this clip."" OR JUST KEEP THE MOTIVES TO YOURSELF. LESS IS MORE.

The purpose of that sequence is to show us that growth for the character (no matter how violent it still may be), and to take the President off the board in order to further destabilize the political situation on the island leading into the third act. Keeping one of the Squad there also gives us more of a tether to jump to scenes that involve the newly installed government (as opposed to just doing it while Harley is with the rest of the squad, which might feel disconnected given that not many of them actually interact with the squad itself outside of the General, briefly).",oyxaam

Also when Harley escapes, she killed trained military guys charging in with automatic rifles with just two pistols in her hand?

So there's a rotating cast with various Superman villains, Batman villains, Flash villains, Wonder Woman villains coming and going.

Usually writers prefer to use the lamer, more minor villains when they want to kill someone off because it won't affect their original comics much.

I think Waller was hedging her bets with two teams. Bloodsport's team was probably more of a back up than anything. 

When one team gets knocked out, she pivots and restragizes.

My reason for thinking this is both that Flag was on the ""diversion"" team (someone who she has Bloodsport go and get later), and how tense and disappointed she seems watching everything go wrong. She even seemed upset Weasel died (not upset in a human/empathetic way, upset in a tactical/sports coach way.) If she had planned to flush those people down from the beginning, she wouldn't have been so tense watching it all go to shit.

Once Flag's team went down, she pivoted and focused on Bloodsport's team.",oyxaam

But this time DC let James Gunn have creative control, so he was able to just make the movie he wanted from the start, which allowed proper time to do post. Ironically Suicide Squad cost LESS than most Marvel movies because James Gunn knew what he wanted from the beginning instead of making things up as he went along. It’s one of the extremely few superhero movies that had zero reshoots.",oyxaam
h8nvbvd,The only scene where the CGI was 'obvious' to me were parts of the rat swarm at the end,oyxaam

The lighting and the details including reflections on his fish scaled skin look top notch.

Compare that to the crock guy in the 2016 movie. With a design to make a somewhat realistic crocodile-man but just ends up looking like a guy with makeup and VFX. In the end that's even less convincing and more distracting somehow.",oyxaam

When he went AWOL with Peacemaker in the room, from that point only one could walk out of their alive. I think the movie only has stakes if these characters can get unceremoniously killed off.",oyxaam
h84bvan,"We never saw his body. Maybe he did a last minute teleport to the alternate polka dimension before being crushed.

Gunn went the extra mile to show us the bodies of the first team (RIP Boomerang) but we never saw Polka's body.",oyxaam

h9tlj3j,"Yeah that’s really one of the only things I didn’t like about this film, the characterisation of Waller. There are times where I’ve seen her angry and shouting but not to the extent shown her, very aggressive and out of control which is the exact opposite of who Waller is. She definitely felt better in Suicide Squad (2016), something the first one got right at least.",oyxaam

h815drz,At least the other bird got revenge eating savants brain.,oyxaam
h84mlm5,Oh my god the stress I had when Sebastian was leading the charge at the end. I was in tears,oyxaam
h863s8n,"My husband watched the movie before I could so when I watched it I was like, “Just tell me one thing. Does Sebastian survive? *You promise?* You promise? Please don’t lie to me.” I don’t think I could have handled it if he didn’t.",oyxaam
h86r46k,I have pet rats and them saving the day was such a treat. Didnt check anything about the movie first so the first appearance of sebastian was also awesome,oyxaam
h8115cr,There were bird animations around Harley during her escape too,oyxaam
h859iiw,Don’t forget the Bird King Shark points out!,oyxaam
h84tkyb,Birds....and they are being killed...Birds of...Prey...AYYY LMAO,oyxaam
h7wy9k1,"I felt so bad for King Shark, he's adorable.",oyxaam
h80yb7f,"I honestly thought he was going to die in that scene, there was a lot of blood. I'm glad I was wrong though, him and Rat Catcher (2) had a great dynamic.",oyxaam
h81c3d3,"Oooo I just realised they reversed it, with Nanaue wanting to eat his not-yet-friends and then finding dumb friends that wants to eat him!",oyxaam
h83kik6,"Yea when he falls out the building and lands on the ground you see him shed a tear while looking at his colorful ""friends"" dying",oyxaam
h858d58,"It's amazing because it actually contributed to his own character arc, himself realizing that it's not good to betray people and nom them lmao",oyxaam
h7y05nv,I thought they were going to be the source of Polka Dot Man's virus.,oyxaam
h85rym5,"If you rewatch the film, look at his eye after he falls to the ground. He's crying.

Idk if its because his new friends died or because he got betrayed.",oyxaam
h85jb49,The way he laughed. He was genuinely happy. Great CGI work and voice acting.,oyxaam
h864lm4,"But in hindsight, they were following his body movements because they were trying eat him. D:",oyxaam
h87wj4o,"Speaking of which, do we know what those creatures are? or if they appear in comics?

I was just not expecting them to attack at all.",oyxaam
h89093s,"The music in that scene was amazing. Friendly, relaxing, and yet with the possibility of creepy the whole time.",oyxaam
h7zxlh0,I thought my boyfriend was gonna cry at that bit.,oyxaam
h86psfi,What were those creatures btw?,oyxaam
h87971s,"The eerie music was warning us, but still, all I *wanted* to see was Live-Action Ponyo.",oyxaam
h8lolnd,Lol I saw it as they were lining up tryna get as close as possible to their meal. They outlined his body because that would be like the spot they have dibs on so to speak,oyxaam
h88h6p6,"The amount of foreshadowing in writing.


They foreshadow this when she makes friends with him and says ""You wouldn't eat friends"", followed by Idris saying ""You're an idiot"".

Basically foreshadowing that there would be a friendship involving the shark that would be a betrayal. 

There was a metric fuckload of foreshadowing beautifully done in this script.",oyxaam
h89k891,Had a Galaxy Quest cute aliens vibe for me,oyxaam
h8k73ym,"Whenever I saw that scene in the trailers, it reminded me of a Pixar movie.",oyxaam
h954pw4,The fact that King Shark shed a tear over the betrayal / deaths of his new dumb friends after getting “flushed” to the ground :’(,oyxaam
h80ql33,I thought he said dope friends,oyxaam
h9ggqb4,"Sly has gotta relax with his ""i'm a big dumb guy laugh"" it was borderline offensive lmao",oyxaam
hbbt4ej,"The moment there was a scene that peaceful, I knew that something was off. I expected those to just smash the glass and come out or something.",oyxaam
hggqdeb,LOL yeah it was cute and then nom Nom makes sense like irl people think animals in cages are their friends but once out nah prey and predator lol,oyxaam
h7wmj23,"Bro, he ate 27 children.",oyxaam
h7w07io,“Did no one check if the Weasel could swim!?” had me rolling.,oyxaam
h80i80o,weasel is a terrifying enigma who eats children but im kinda glad he's ok.,oyxaam
h7xkbpx,"Honestly though, Weasel still has the tracking explosive in his head. I was waiting for his head to explode the entire time he was shuffling off screen.",oyxaam
h7wbs77,I knew he was going to come back when he didn't straight out drown (which was the best bit in the entire movie). I was cheering so hard when he *finally* got up at the end.,oyxaam
h81mjgb,I felt bad for Savant. He died pissing his pants. That slaughter broked him into crying like a little bitch.,oyxaam
h83cgtm,He was all I cared about from the minute I saw him. I hope he’s living his best child-eating life now.,oyxaam
h821sxl,"I really wanted the credits to end with ""Weasel will return in....""",oyxaam
h7wh6gi,"Yeah, that's probbo a problem for the children of Carto Maltese.",oyxaam
h822ehz,Kinda thought the first death was going to be Rooker heroically attempting CPR on weasel only to get his face chewed off tbh,oyxaam
h83ra16,I'd be terrified to know that a creepy humanoid weasel creature that had previously been incarcerated for killing lots of children was roaming my forest.,oyxaam
h8115dx,"As he was getting pulled from the water at the beginning I thought he _had_ to be alive, otherwise why show him getting pulled from the water just to say he’s dead? It was nice to see that at the very end!",oyxaam
h7x7xjw,"That was the one thing I knew was going to happen.  It just seemed so weird that they focused on him drowning a bit too much.  In the back of my mind I was like,, Weasel is going to survive right.",oyxaam
h7y0jiu,"And now 27 more children must be very, very scared.",oyxaam
h7zxg7o,He's gonna kill so many Maltesan(?) children.,oyxaam
h8280kp,"Since he's basically a rodent, it would be funny to see him interacting with Rat Catcher 2",oyxaam
h85gjxx,Thought it was an ironic joke of how killing kids was the drawn line for almost every character and the child killer still gets to live,oyxaam
h89omi2,"I didn't like either of the post credit scenes. Those moments his better when the characters stay dead. Obviously I suspected Cena would live because of his series.

The Weasel needlessly dying because of typical bureaucratic incompetence was just fucking hilarious.",oyxaam
h8jlamb,Imagine how I feel right now.  I'm a dumbass who watched it on release and turned it off before any post credit scenes... I can't believe the weasel is alive and my day is now significantly better.,oyxaam
h7zgm3p,We’re gonna need a bunch of tiny coffins soon,oyxaam
h8wlwej,"I told my husband he’d live, right again",oyxaam
h80svhz,So what was the point in killing him off? What a waste of potential comedy moments,oyxaam
h7x2xwt,They did say they were probably sure he was some ancient god.,oyxaam
h816zof,"I didn't see him as Invincible, just incredibly durable. I took as having super thick skin, but he was actually injured when those fish with sharp teeth were attacking him.",oyxaam
h80i3zz,"I thought it was over, I think I whispered ""no!"" to myself because I could imagine the splat in my head before it was going to happen.",oyxaam
h8i0t22,"i thought for sure he was gona get brutally ripped in half like the brainiac guy was. He was grabbed exactly the same way, right after polka dot died, so i was expecting the 1-2 gut punch",oyxaam
h7wv8dy,Sebastian mate,oyxaam
h7wmk5q,[deleted],oyxaam
h7w62xm,He is the best shark-man himbo.,oyxaam
h7w5o3d,It’s gonna be a token James Gunn trait to get a high profile actor to voice like 10 lines of dialogue for large CGI companion.,oyxaam
h7wghgk,"Nah man, Sebastian was. I just knew that little dude was gonna die and I prepared for it the whole damn movie. His ending with Idris was just perfect. This whole fucking movie was perfect.",oyxaam
h7vzp3e,I was thinking ragnarok Hulk,oyxaam
h7wlye6,"Nah, he didn't have a metal jaw or mohawk here, he was safe.",oyxaam
h8hthr0,He's better than Groot,oyxaam
h8zp4h9,I mean they are aliens. Their teeth might be made of a denser substance than whatever Bloodsport's packing.,oyxaam
h7wgljt,I was seriously thinking we were about to discover like an unknown power he had. Like communicating with sealife and they were going to become his minions. I was wrong.,oyxaam
h8i10jw,i was super ready for staro to rip him into pieces exactly like brainiac guy. Was SO glad to see him get yeeted right into a building instead,oyxaam
h891a67,lmao same with the building,oyxaam
h81kzhh,Nom nom?,oyxaam
h7w2trp,"Characters I needed to survive:
1. Sebastian
2. King Shark
3. Ratcatcher 2
4. Polka-Dot Man

considering the body count … 3/4 ain’t bad at all",oyxaam
h810okg,"Ponyo!!! YES!!! That's exactly what those things reminded me of, I just couldn't place it!!",oyxaam
h8qdc0b,I mean the rocks doing Black Adam.,oyxaam
h7w7t0n,They used plastic store baggies to hold bombs! They were the real heroes,oyxaam
h7wv0cw,"I like how Flag wasn't willing to give Milton a gun, but giving him a bunch of explosives was fine.",oyxaam
h7xr3o3,"I got a good laugh when Harley calls Bloodsport Milton at the end. 

Her Harley has gotten really good. I didn’t watched the first suicide squad or birds of prey until a few weeks ago. This side of the DC universe is definitely shaping up better than the heroes.",oyxaam
h7whlou,He was even in the slow mo super hero rain shot hahaha,oyxaam
h7wtwby,Milton was great. Went out like a hero.,oyxaam
h7wb50n,"As they were walking into the building, my wife was like, wtf is this guy even still with them??",oyxaam
h7xe5nt,"I loved that he was on the far right of the ""hero's entrance"" scene lmfao.",oyxaam
h883tx6,Dude wore sandals to an assault raid. Absolute legend.,oyxaam
h7zu31o,Right up to when Harley called Bloodshot Milton at the end!!!,oyxaam
h7w3znc,He was also the guy who brought them to the bar to capture the dude with all the dilldos sticking out his head.,oyxaam
h7wxmrr,"Seriously! Such a genius joke/scene. We as the audience SAW him in the background, and those who pay attention during movies would've noticed a minor plot hole of a background character suddenly disappearing. Was a really meta joke about the badass heroes in action films never concerning themselves for the background characters in poorly written media.",oyxaam
h80tt6z,"it was like there was extra footage of them getting to know Milton but it wasn't used. 

The whole movie felt like there were chunks missing that could have made a lot of jokes land better. In place of those scenes we just got more killing.",oyxaam
h89qbtj,Me too. Milton should have stayed in the Van. Seeing him in that white rain scene was weird.,oyxaam
h7vzv6q,Idris Elba's character,oyxaam
h7vz94w,HE WAS THERE THE WHOLE TIME!!,oyxaam
h7wfl5g,Steve the pirate,oyxaam
h80ogkg,There's been a guy with us named milton?!,oyxaam
h7y3bwt,"Are you serious, he's been here the whole time?!?!",oyxaam
h7wn7e7,"jim milton, nice to meet you",oyxaam
h7z2umq,"You’re Milton, we just talked about this for like 3 hours. We",oyxaam
h7w7pn5,Friend what is your icon on here it looks rabidly cool,oyxaam
h86iydk,He wrote Paradise Lost.,oyxaam
h80padb,Honestly Polka-Dot man surviving so far and actually doing shit was so fucking fun. Shame they killed him at the end,oyxaam
h7wkcr7,"The gag happens in a office open space, this is definitely a nod to the movie Office Space where a character named Milton is mainly ignored by all the rest of his coworkers.",oyxaam
h7xjisn,"Many, MANY native latinos have english sounding names. Latino mothers think it looks fancy.",oyxaam
h7w51k9,His parents thought it'd be memorable name for their son.,oyxaam
h81durj,"I was honestly hoping that “Milton” was a name that Polkadot imagined and dude’s name was a typical Latin one. So when they’d report back to rebels, everyone would be confused at who the heck is Milton.",oyxaam
h7wf9xe,Mike Judge fans maybe?,oyxaam
h8p5crc,Her?,oyxaam
h80pe8c,"I don’t think he could’ve, unless he has a Bloodsport fall through the building and survives",oyxaam
h7x2ixr,Catwoman,oyxaam
h7y3jnf,just absolutely minding their own business. this is the suicide squad we always needed.,oyxaam
h7z43y1,[deleted],oyxaam
h8061u8,"I knew within the first second because the one ""bad"" guy offered to take the other ""bad"" guy's coffee cup for a refill. Bad guys just don't do that in movies.",oyxaam
h865cxb,"I started to think something was off here with the lady (I thought she was doing laundry).  
""These people look nothing like the well armed army from the beach. Are you sure these are the bad guys?!""",oyxaam
h83tt3y,The guy in the bed and Peacemaker chopping him to bits.,oyxaam
h81oo1j,Bad people don't wash dishes and take baths,oyxaam
h8h3i2p,I've been playing Last of Us a lot recently so Ive gotten used to brutally killing *seemingly* innocent people. Didnt see that mini twist coming at all,oyxaam

h7yjd5v,Wasn’t that bloodsport that did that? Then Peacemaker shot the guy behind him,oyxaam
hc3unwc,"A bit late but I love this comment, made me laugh out loud.",oyxaam
h88kik4,"It seemed pretty intentional. Like theyre trying to be all stealthy and shit, but are making a big mess and no one is reacting to it. Found it quite funny",oyxaam
hy9u0n4,"I noticed there were a lot of scenes that they decided to suspend belief. Harley Quinn did like a 12 foot vertical, guards are surprisingly inattentive. The rain was impressively blinding. I think they’re just fun creative choices the team did to make the movie a little more fun",oyxaam
h85gfqw,"They aren't random American, it's literally a group of super villain criminal. They are meant to be evil and careless.",oyxaam
h8vdp7d,still less collateral then any avengers outing,oyxaam
he23nmz,Dats da jowk. They've turned Blue Skies into a portent of Drone Strikes.,oyxaam
h82oheu,Yup. You got me. I’m 13.,oyxaam
h80btqw,"The funny thing about that is that she’s apparently Flo Crawley, Waller’s niece in the comics. In the original series, it was a recurring theme that Waller surrounded herself with subordinates, including Flo, who would keep her amorality in check and prevent her from committing atrocities.

Which is what she did here too",oyxaam
h7x4273,I was surprised she didn't kill Waller. Leaving her alive was a grave mistake.,oyxaam
h800db1,I think the only thing that saved her was that she attacked from behind. Usually I consider it a pussy move but I’ll allow it here. Prevented Waller from knowing 100% who hit her.,oyxaam
h7yjk2y,Yup. I think she's already dead tbh,oyxaam
h84z12p,"I understand why people would remember it that way, but she's actually looking at the big dude and the blonde woman. I think that moment is a callback to the previous film. She shot her own comms people because they ""didn't have clearance"", but was annoyed that she wouldn't do the same for revenge. Can't have personal grudges if you disconnect your own person from your purpose that completely.",oyxaam
h80xxnn,"Right, that dirty ass look right at the end.",oyxaam
h86mul0,Maybe not. That character is Flo Crawley who is Amanda Waller’s niece or cousin in the comics. She gave her the job as a favor to her family.,oyxaam
h88fqm2,"Previous movie, she murdered her team. The real heroes were the sweating nerds in the ops center. Working men heroes.",oyxaam
h9g8pun,She's notably not with the others in the post credits team.,oyxaam
h86z6bv,They were perfect. Too bad they’ll be 6 feet under by the time the credits finish rolling,oyxaam
h88rrel,"Jobs like that can get incredibly bleak. Human life isn't taken lightly but when bad things happen, jokes after the fact don't hurt anyone.",oyxaam
he237bn,"Definitely >!Cabin in the Woods,!< but that's a massive spoiler, mate!",oyxaam
h7wm1p6,"They did a \*really\* good job of getting you invested in these characters.  I wish it was telegraphed just a \*little\* less, but I'm sitting here sad that the fucking Polka-Dot Man got smished.",oyxaam
h80b7u5,I was so good that Flag was an actual characther in this. Even Boomer's death was das because of Harley's reaction alone. It's crazy how good this characters were this time when you give them something to do,oyxaam
h7wlohg,"My first thought after the movie, other that thinking that it was great, was that I cared more about Flag, Bloodsport, Harley, Ratcatcher 2, and freakin King Shark than I did emotionally about any previous DCEU Superheroes. And these guys are even superheroes! I've seen every DCEU movie and none of the characters feel warm. NONE. This is the movie that had me emotionally connected to characters and this was a ridiculous movie! Best DCEU film ever for me.",oyxaam
h80ll1m,"They are proving they could kill anyone at any time aside from Harley Quinn.

Flag was always cast well... The butchering they did to him in Suicide Squad didn't impede the character or the casting.

Hit me right in the feels.",oyxaam
h80wkmf,Didn't give a fuck about him in the first movie.  Had the same reaction as you when he died in this one.  Gunn did such a good job making all of the characters likable.,oyxaam
h7wvg98,I liked Flag from the start he was likable in the 1st one too so it was extra sad for me as i really wanted him to survive considering the glow up he got here,oyxaam
h7yrxat,"Same! All I know about him after two movies, is that he's just some army guy, but his death really hit hard",oyxaam
h7x743l,Because this movie made him an actual character instead of generic soldier number 4 like the first one did.,oyxaam
h80ie5r,"They did him dirty 

When jotunheim was in the movie I was expecting a heroic end for him like the comics. 

Oh well peacemakers cred had to built off of killing Flag /s",oyxaam
h86qbtr,This version of Rick Flag actually had a personality and I was rooting for him.,oyxaam
h88j2ab,That was my reaction to Boomerang Man! I thought they'd keep him.,oyxaam
h8899gx,"Because Joel Kinnaman

I've thought ""oh no Joel Kinnaman's character"" too many times",oyxaam
h80ahet,Yeah but that actor is so one toned dude. It is hard to get into him at all.,oyxaam
h817i53,"Yeah, I thought he was fine in the first movie, but they actually got me invested in him in this one.",oyxaam
h84l8ef,"For some reason he reminds me of Bullseye, from DareDevil netflix series...",oyxaam
h802sl0,"If you haven't seen it, check out ""The Killing"" on Netflix. Slow burn murder mystery Kinneman is in. He's great in it.",oyxaam
h7xfzt2,"June Moon presumably is yeah, I think Enchantress is technically dead.",oyxaam
h891eij,He died the way she lived: being literally stabbed in the heart.,oyxaam
h839zrm,"It'd be realll funny if she brought him back as the vessel for her brother, and Gunn writes in this weird ass pseudo incest love arc where Rick and and June are in love with each other, and both them and  Enchantress and Incubus are kinda grossed out/ trying to figure if it's okay.",oyxaam
h7wk23z,He was obviously advised to not get killed by it,oyxaam
h80idbo,Yes! I’m used to just one or two members dying bc that was the original tag line on the first comic for SS but Gunn said fuck it everyone dies.,oyxaam
h7yn9fh,I think she's pretty good about having her friends' backs.,oyxaam
h7wzh9x,"Unironically would watch a Katana solo movie. Just go full samurai revenge with it, and play up how horrific the idea of having your soul trapped in a sword really is 

She was by far the coolest member in the first Suicide Squad movie, they just had no idea what to do with her and had the terrible introduction scene",oyxaam
h8a8qvm,"They could have just cut Rick Flag from the last movie and had Katana lead the squad in his place. Then again, they also could have and should have three other characters from the previous film because they did nothing.",oyxaam
h7wrq0k,[deleted],oyxaam
h7zqezk,"I genuinely thought it was spelt with two g’s, Flag as a surname seemed way too on the nose so I figured they would have made it Flagg to make it a smidge less ridiculous.",oyxaam
h81yliv,I'm used to Flagg from GI Joe and Randall Flagg,oyxaam
h7wu78r,Her sword traps the sooooooouls of her victims,oyxaam
h7x1iz6,"That shot of the shard going directly into his heart doesn’t really give me much hope, unless Flashpoint resets the DCEU then I think this is the last we’ll see of Flagg.",oyxaam
h7xnu2d,"Most of the deaths in this one seem...very final. They kinda drove it home when most of them died. And in some cases, buried it a bit (Polka-dot Man).",oyxaam
h7z6ipr,That was Peacemaker.,oyxaam
h7z43d7,No he did not.,oyxaam
h7zg82q,that was peacemaker.,oyxaam
h8eodfi,"That was Pom Klementieff, she plays Mantis in the MCU, Katana was played by Karen Fukuhara (who now plays Kimiko in The Boys).",oyxaam

h80xm3m,Milton’s “Sí” when the squad meets him for the first time was A+++ comedic acting. That was one of the best lines into he movie for me and it was packed full of good lines,oyxaam
h7ytubl,Hey! I’ll have you know I liked him from the very beginning!,oyxaam
h8d56go,What? Is he going to stay in the Bus and get interrogated by the government? I noticed he was coming with him and I fucking love that it payed off.,oyxaam
h8e2d76,"I saw him too, but I think the goal was for him to be there the whole time and nobody pay much attention. The audience should have been as surprised as Harley.",oyxaam
h8dt05d,his shuffling gait with the flipflops was a great touch,oyxaam
h8qsw4b,I was dying when he was still with them walking in the building in the back,oyxaam
h9mbcf5,It was funnier for me because I legit didn't notice him until his death scene. I was like Harley.,oyxaam
h856iuf,Reminded me of Peter from Deadpool 2.,oyxaam
h80oaya,"Sadly, you could find out who it was in the second trailer. You see him on the roof and it matched his shirt.

But I didn't expect anyone to care when he died",oyxaam
h80sekd,"Right after I watched it I went back to some of the 11-month-old threads, when the plot got leaked (supposedly), and it seems like quite a lot of stuff actually lined up! Some interesting departures from what was posted and what was in the final product, such as the character Idris Elba playing instead Vigilante (I think?) and Vandal Savage being the Big Bad.",oyxaam
h7wzdoz,"That's hilarious, I didn't even pay attention to those trailers. But I did notice him in the background of every scene, and KNEW there would be a payoff because it's James Gunn lol",oyxaam
h7ycule,It was Ralph Bohner all along!,oyxaam

h8342xd,"I thought they would be loveable little things that would all die and I would be sad, then they betrayed king shark and I was sad for different reason but I hated them.

So are we to assume killer croc and katana are dead? What about deadshot?",oyxaam
h811m6f,I had to pause the movie when he proudly yet flatly showed off his little peacemaker bomb. I haven’t laughed that hard in quite a while.,oyxaam
h84sa94,Man my wife was literally in tears thinking he died a half dozen times. She was already bent out of shape about weasel so at least that turned out good,oyxaam
h80pnlc,He was so happy!,oyxaam
h7wmrk0,"The fact that I know it's Stallone voicing these lines, makes them even funnier.",oyxaam
h7zmpyg,"I was upset at first that he wasn't voiced by Ron Funches, but man Sly worked here. King Shark is great in both Harley Quinn and The Suicide Squad.",oyxaam
h7yj9hb,Charisma?,oyxaam
h899zz7,Pretty sure marvel/Disney is in a perfect position for that now with Taika doing the next Thor and Gunn back with GotG,oyxaam

h7x5ufz,Honestly felt a bit teared up.,oyxaam
h87ahed,"It should've been a parody of how Gunn just keeps humanizing the worst scum shitheads, but I *couldn't help but genuinely feel sorry for it*. The thing was tortured and raped for decades, because they wanted to make a weapon out of it.",oyxaam
h80bbwn,"Definitely had some ""tears in the rain"" vibes",oyxaam
h85j6m9,I found it kinda funny they had Harley deliver the final blow. A common critique was what hell can Harley do against Superman level threats.,oyxaam
h8a71bk,"James Gunn is truly a fantastic filmmaker. Stuff like that, you just don’t get in most movies. He’s special.",oyxaam
h88wh42,Amazing. Even Starro had a storyarc.,oyxaam
h88sznw,That part made me feel pretty sad. Could’ve just left starro a villain but it was enraged and rightfully so. But starro made it sound like it was neutral for all its life,oyxaam
h88sn0m,That really hit emotionally. Dude never asked for this.,oyxaam
h8d7obk,didn't some dude on Reddit make a whole web-comic series about a killer star fish from Spongebob? Swear that was the last line too lol,oyxaam
h8d8t1q,"I didn't hear the line clearly and only heard ""I was happy.""  I thought it was Ratcatcher's rat saying goodbye to Ratcatcher.",oyxaam

h90v9lr,Also never expected to see Starro in full colour like this.,oyxaam
h7wkacn,"And the little Starros looked so silly, but there were so many terrifying shots of them.  Like in the lab, where he tries to remove one and it peeled the face off or when they were first released and you see the mandible gnashing it's teeth as it aims for a face.",oyxaam
h7wozgl,My favorite thing James does is bring humanity to everyone. Even starro at the end saying he was happy when just staring at the stars is so lovely. While other directors would just make him a 2D menace,oyxaam
h80d6j9,"I thought he did at least one incredibly cool thing, the first time it walks and stumbles and then resets 72 degrees on different arms. Great use of the radial symmetry of starfish.",oyxaam
h7yzge9,"Remember when everyone said ""Oh Taika Waititi is voicing Starro, isn't he?""  


So glad even Gunn knew that would be a stupid Idea. The idea that we can go back and have him as the original Ratcatcher if they wanted is awesome.",oyxaam
h7wxkgk,"Which of course made it cool, because it was unique. And unlike other movies in this DCEU franchise it actually had some FUCKING COLOUR, it wasn't just a huge grey blob",oyxaam
h80l41k,I thought for sure he'd be treated like a joke based on his appearance alone. Nope. He's a terrifying eldritch abomination hell bent on destruction and somehow it works perfectly.,oyxaam

LOOOVED it.",oyxaam

h7wgu3w,Definitely had Bikini Bottom Horror vibes during his premiere,oyxaam

h7yxvy7,At least the HBO show did it in a flashback and it was pretty horrifying too,oyxaam
h7z5vfs,The movie is no longer the premier adaptation of Watchmen. The show has taken over that spot and alien squids are a huge plot point in it,oyxaam
h80d2ja,The movie did it better so...,oyxaam
h7ykz9x,"Wait, its budget was $200 million? For an R-rated movie? Released during the pandemic?

WTF was Warner Bros thinking? It may be great but it's going to bomb. Now I'm afraid there won't be a sequel.",oyxaam
h7xyn7x,"Yep. Thought the same thing. Like, the Squad or Bloodsport was gonna talk to Starro, reason with it and then it'll blast off into space or something.",oyxaam
h9fgnbb,And was happy while doing so! Poor thing.,oyxaam
h813mnu,"I remember years ago, Kevin Feige was asked what advice he'd have for DC and their movies, and his response was along the lines of respecting the source material no matter how weird it was.  And I think that's something Marvel has done a much better job with.  I mean, James Gunn brought us a raccoon and talking tree and made them beloved characters.  Meanwhile, DC tended to play it a lot more straight and typically went with the dark and serious angle. 

It's good to see DC finally start to lean into that more with their movies, and James Gunn was really the perfect choice to fully embrace the crazier aspects of DC.  Hopefully the fact that this is one of the most critically acclaimed DCEU movies recently shows DC that audiences are perfectly fine with them digging into the stranger aspects of DC, because there really is a ton of content there to mine.",oyxaam
h7zaazz,People rightfully think of DC films as inconsistent but the looser universe also means there is much more creative leeway and the films don’t feel as generic even when some of them are bad whereas with MCU you get consistent mediocrity,oyxaam

h82hxv7,"I don't think it was for shock.  I think the idea here is that they have to kill off about half the team every movie so that they can bring in new cannon fodder in the next one.  It's not like there's any shortage of C-list DC villains.

h7yr5up,>Suicide Squad,oyxaam
h80uon2,"I agree with you honestly. If they had that type of death for one of the 1st squad, it works a lot better in my opinion. I felt like PDM’s death was a little unceremonious and silly given the point in the story it happened at, and how much they had developed him as a character. We’d probably be saying the same thing had they done an over the top “noble death” saving someone else or sacrificing himself to kill Starro, so it’s hard to say what would have been the perfect death for him. It also didn’t help that it felt telegraphed from the trailers as well, maybe it would have worked better had they not shown him yelling “I’m a superhero!” and it was more of a surprise.",oyxaam
h7zs2iw,"I knew he was dead as soon as they cut to him. You are getting downvoted but you're right. A death executed this way fits right into the movie and that's the problem - it was expected.

h7wutuz,"The deaths of everybody in the beginning of film had no impact at all, or were funny. It's an interesting contrast to Polka Dot Man and Flag. Flag's death was surprising, and Polka Dot Man's death was pretty sad.

At least he died happy, though.

You know, it just occurred to me that Captain Boomerang's death means he won't ever appear as a Flash villain in the future. That's fine, considering a dude who throws boomerangs is such a stupid, weak villain for a guy who can run so fast he can literally travel back in time.",oyxaam

He lived to the point of being a part of that “family,” and yet had a joke death. Every other death at the beginning worked because they were meant to be cannon fodder, and this one still got me, but maybe because I wanted more of him and really didn’t like how he went out. At least he had a good moment before he went out.

h7x568x,Calendar man calling him a Pussy was a highlight as well,oyxaam
h811bbu,I was just sad that Nathan Fillion was included in that. There’s never enough Fillion,oyxaam
h7x0s9v,"We all knew a ton of them were going to die right off the bat, but the way he did it, where they weren't even the real squad! Amazing fake out!",oyxaam
h802q68,Also I'm glad they made him a snitch. Made the headshot even sweeter.,oyxaam
h86m4v6,Im more annoyed that Pete played a character literally named Dick Hertz and didnt get his dick shot off.,oyxaam
h7zsrot,"Same, we all had a feeling it was going to pull a Deadpool 2. What I was surprised was that it kind of didn’t make any sense. Blackguard somehow was in communication with the other country while in a Superprison? How did he even know the mission until right when they were sent?

That kind of bugged me the more I thought about it",oyxaam
h84592c,I was bummed about a certain Aussie cause he was actually the standout of the first IMO,oyxaam
h8gy8kv,"I knew a lot of the cast were going to die with how large it was, but not in like, the first ten minutes.",oyxaam

Fuckin nope.",oyxaam

h7xdsn3,I could tell it would be early on because he’s nowhere to be found in any of the dramatic scenes in the trailer.  but he didn’t even make it past the last of the title credits!,oyxaam
h7xrjtz,Right?,oyxaam
h81fdnc,"His Stan parody was fantastic.

And the way he shit on Dan Crenshaw and then basically walked back the apology that NBC had forced him up give",oyxaam
h83elz4,"Only Pete haters I know are older Republican folks who were miffed by his jokes about Crenshaw. Which is really stupid because in one of his recent standup specials you hear a little background on that whole deal. If I recall correctly, the joke wasn’t even one he wrote. Regardless, even if he wrote it, it’s Saturday Night Live. It’s comedy. 

Beyond that, I don’t know other reasons he may draw hate.",oyxaam
h8mtp83,"Shit man, he's funny now but he was much more brutal before he got really famous.

I remember he got two producers to quit live on a radio show when he first got on SNL.",oyxaam
h7wgikc,Or just people who don’t like talentless douchebags,oyxaam
h7z8qcb,Have you watched King of Staten Island? It's first Pete being Pete and not some legendary performance. But it's kinda endearing and feels extremely heartfelt.,oyxaam
h7y9ajb,I don't get why they don't put some movie makeup on him to stop him from looking like he has a disease. I guess that's part of his look.,oyxaam
h7w0y68,"I hear he’s leaving SNL to do more movies too. Not sure if he’s got staying power to last outside of it, but he’s like Lorne Michaels’ pet project now.",oyxaam
h7xvvre,https://youtu.be/Ie6LpKOJVf0,oyxaam
h7xnv5i,The larger bullet was actually a hollow point bullet. Pretty cool detail.,oyxaam
h7x5iad,It also works as a subtle way for Bloodsport to admit Peacemaker was right lol,oyxaam
h7we2ob,"Chekhov's golf club playing an important role, too.",oyxaam
h80898j,Just drove home even more how full of shit Peacemaker was since he was the one bragging about having smaller bullets at the beginning,oyxaam
h82wdtx,I loved the subtle use of a hollow point on the bigger round vs the armor piercing tip of the smaller.,oyxaam
h80n33m,I think that's why the smaller one was a pointed bullet.,oyxaam
h8m5jkf,Well the movie is produced by Zack Snyder so you can’t count on something like that paying off,oyxaam
h7zlc1o,Smaller impact force gives it more “weight”.,oyxaam
h7xm6vl,"When Idris Elba landed in front of John Cena I told my wife

""Wow. Its like James Gunn looked at the last Suicide Squad and said, 'yeah I'm gonna do the opposite of that""""

""What's the opposite of that?""

""A good fucking movie""",oyxaam
h7wb9lm,"Same. Said it as soon as I saw the show down about to happen. Just ""smaller bullet"" had husband confused for a second lol",oyxaam
h80l22a,"If you notice, when the rats are inside Starro, the hole they make kinda looked like an asshole. I think that’s why Harley was smiling",oyxaam
h82al3c,Definitely turned Rick flag into a red one,oyxaam
h7x2m1r,That was said while bragging so either it wasn't true or Bloodsport got himself smaller bullets after.,oyxaam
h8z6y6a,That didnt seem like he really meant it. More like he was just making shit up to make his boasts make sense.,oyxaam
h7zqg6d,"Yes, using rounds that are considered by the Hague Convention as inhumane.

Fun fact: That provision of the Hague Convention was downvoted by the United States",oyxaam
h809ve1,"Nah, you got it. You were supposed to think “looks like Bloodsports were smaller after all!” 

It’s most likely just showing that Bloodsport really was more badass after all, but he was just less cocky about it. Another thought is that he knew to use special super small bullets, since Peacemaker bragged about it earlier.",oyxaam
h80a0ss,"He claimed that, yes. But it was supposed to be more of a childish fight, he didn’t actually know the size of Bloodsport’s bullets, he was just trying to one-up him.",oyxaam
h84p39o,"He had joked that he would shoot more dead center than Idris Elba, and when asked how that would work, he said smaller bullets, so that he could shoot straight through Elba's bullet hole without even touching the sides. That would technically be a more accurate shot, as the radius from the center would be less with a smaller bullet than with a bigger one.",oyxaam
h84pwmb,"For what it's worth, that is actually the shape of a hollow-point bullet, so it was more than just a random design element to have the other bullet shoot through it.

The bullet is shaped in that way so that it pancakes when it hits something, while a conventional bullet is designed to shoot cleanly though as much material as possible before stopping. Hollow-point bullets are useful for reducing collateral damage as they will stop when they hit something, but are banned by the Hague Convention because they cause significantly more damage in whatever they hit.

So in a way, the scene also served to paint Peacemaker as a war criminal by having him use the dirtier option.",oyxaam
h815q8p,"Earlier when Bloodsport was like, ""Why is he here, he does the same thing as me?"" And peacemaker mentioned that he shot smaller bullets that fit in larger bullet holes without hitting the side.",oyxaam
h87kr1u,I’m confused what are you talking about?,oyxaam
h81i2qz,Probably a studio note.,oyxaam
h81g8dl,Yeah I never watch the trailers these days. Only a small minority does something creative with trailers without giving away an entire movie plot. But most of them just do a quick summary with the biggest eye candy moments. What’s the point of watching after.,oyxaam
h89ew5w,I couldn't hold back my laughter while weasle was drowning,oyxaam
h7xravm,I mean they didn't have much choice.  The cast straight up rebelled to Gunn being fired.,oyxaam
h822962,Gunn making both DC and Marvel amazing,oyxaam
h8g7gdd,"Honestly, there was a part of me that was worried everybody was putting Gunn up on a pedestal here, just assuming that handing him the keys to Suicide Squad would be a sure-fire slam dunk because ""hey, he did the GOTG movies and those were fun, right?""  It seemed possible that maybe he'd been spread too thin with this AND being re-hired by Disney, and the other shoe might finally drop with this movie.  But nope, he nailed it.  I'm now very optimistic for GOTG3.",oyxaam

h89hexa,"There’s a non-zero chance he could return. Supposedly in the comics he’s had access to some stolen time-reversing tech that lets him “boomerang” himself out of being dead, and folks are noticing how brightly his boomerang is glowing in his upthrust hand. It *could* have just been the moonlight reflecting off the blade, but having gone back and looked I gotta say… it glows really brightly.

So take heart, there’s a loophole for ol’ Boomer if the writers wanted to use it. This is supeheroes! We used to say the only people who ever stayed dead were Uncle Ben and Jason Todd, and then Red Hood happened so… ;)",oyxaam
h885n0p,That last smile he gave to Harley tho.,oyxaam
h86rz57,Wow,oyxaam

h7zpf8c,I wonder if they had some payoff with her working for the rebel fighters.,oyxaam

The late dictator's one-night stand with Quinn, where they thoroughly and passionately redecorate his office. We get a quick glimpse of his exposed ass before he smokes his last cigarette. 

At the nightclub, while the squad is exiting through the back door, they wander through the dancer's dressing room with exposed titties.

h7we5lr,I loved his stack of superhero landings at the end lmao.,oyxaam
h81l57e,The scene with Bloodsport and his daughter was great. It made him feel like a real villain and Idris is great actor. Deadshot couldn’t hope to be as good as Bloodsport.,oyxaam
h7xg83b,"He looked genuinely scared in that scene more than any other time I’ve ever seen him. And this, the guy from the Wire and Luther, among others.",oyxaam

h87gv31,"The question is that what will they do with Deadshot now that Bloodsport is basically the same character but more likeable considering he has a greater potential for growth and empathy. But they haven't addressed whether this movie is canon and replaces the events of the first one, or if the first one was set in an alternate universe.",oyxaam
h88nf5a,"I was so happy it wasn't Deadshot.  Deadshot it's like... seen a bunch of Deadshot, and you know he'd live.  Bloodsport you could totally off the character at any point.

Only person you knew would live is Harley, and that's like the comics too, Harley always survives in some crazy-improbable manner.  Then again comic Harley is legitimately really tough to kill.",oyxaam

h7w8mlc,"I'm kinda in favor of keeping the grim tone of Snyder's DCEU heroes with this movie's tone for the villains, to be honest. 

Marvel and DC will always be compared to each other, so while Marvel has (largely) one-note villains and quippy, comedic heroes, it'd be fun to reverse it for DC going forward: the heroes are the straight-men, and the villains are multi-dimensional and fun. Since DC heroes tend to be more archetypal, this wouldn't be out of left field for them, either.",oyxaam
h7w98wb,Idris Elba’s character even said Dim Mak in the humvee scene. That’s the karate move JCVD had to prove to the judges in the Bloodsport movie. It came full circle haha,oyxaam

h9ad5km,Watching Idris in this makes me upset that the Dark Tower sucked so fucking much,oyxaam
h7xfdha,There's no way this movie would he better if we had individual movies for these characters. No one would stand on their own and the only reason why they would is because this movie was made,oyxaam
h7wjnb7,"It's a superhero comedy love letter to cheesy 80s-90s action movies, I think they intentionally didn't go too deep on anything so the focus is on just doing fun stuff. All the supporting characters are hilariously 2 dimensional so you can watch a bunch of them get killed and not feel bad",oyxaam

h814j3j,"I didn't really like Margot as Harley when I watched SS, but tbh I think it's just because it was such a bad movie. I watched Birds of Prey this summer and, damn. Margot really is perfect for Harley.",oyxaam
h814z63,"I wasn't sold on her in the beginning, but it's definitely a role she's grown into and proven how great the casting is.  Even her accent has gotten much better.  I hope we get the Gotham City Sirens movie she's been pushing for.",oyxaam

Then he was among my favorites in TSS. I hope that guy and Ratcatcher 2’s actress have a burgeoning career after this.",oyxaam
h7xjm1g,It helps that they didn't write Rick Flagg like he was trying too hard to be badass with every line. They dropped the whole military vibe and I swear his accent is different too. Just made him more like an action hero dude.,oyxaam

This is obviously Very VERY morally grey. Sure Peacemaker killed Rick flag. But is it any different then when Doctor Manhattan killed Rorschach? Peacemaker knew if that information got out more people would die. It would break a lot of the trust most countries have in the U.S.
Was it the right thing to do? Well that depends on your outlook. But no matter what your outlook, You have to admit this movie has been better than 90% of the schlock DC has produced and I’m looking forward to what James Gunn can do with both the peace maker character and Amanda Waller.",oyxaam

h7xi4ni,"Critics: no one likes a showoff

Gunn: *crafting that scene* unless what they are showing off is dope as FUCK",oyxaam

h8118o4,And the rain fight scene!,oyxaam
h7wzhaa,fuck! thats true!,oyxaam
hggr2hf,And we clearly need more of it fuck yeah,oyxaam

h8btsil,"I was hoping he was gonna outsmart them, since ya know, that's his thing. 
At least he looked cool and I dug the performance.",oyxaam
h8i51vn,"I liked the movie but GOAT status? He makes good action comedies but I don’t think that puts him even close to contention for one of the best directors of all time. (In my opinion same applies for Soderburg and Wright). It sounds pretentious but, man you gotta watch some more movies...",oyxaam
h7xhjmt,Him freaking out in the end while Rats swarmed him and Ratcatcher protectively wrapping a arm around him was one of the most touching moments on in the movie.,oyxaam
h7xdo5n,McCavityyyy….,oyxaam
h88obay,I think when Idris is in other blockbusters he kinda goes with the flow and acts a little campier. I think this time he really played it straight and acted like he was in a serious drama which really played a better straight man than being sarcastic all the time,oyxaam

h9vvta7,It's almost enough for me to forget The Dark Tower...almost.,oyxaam
h854c2u,"My inner child absolutely fucking loved how he just took shit out of his armour and transformed them into weapons.

Modular tech is so fucking cool and I love it when they get a spotlight in movies.
 
Props to the team doing his armour/aresnal design. So consistent, so precise. Cool sounds and animations. Little things that absolutely play a part to enhances the portrayal of a character like that.

It's like James Gunn got the team who did Star Lord's retractable helmet effects and gave them the opportunity to absolutely flex.

Anyway sorry to ramble and fixate on this very niche thing but hey, it stood out to me and I'd like to verbally appreciate the work that went to it.",oyxaam
h7wem66,also i love that while he cares for his daughter he’s not a doting father. their screaming match in the prison was a great subversion of the trope especially based off what we’d seen of her from the trailer,oyxaam
h7wv13d,"It’s weird you say that. I just watched a youtuber review the first film, and he said the exact same thing: Will Smith is too well-liked as a person to play grizzled hardasses or anti-heroes.",oyxaam

h80wb9y,"> And Smith is just too likable for that

I think this is Smith's problem, honestly. He's so obsessed with his brand that he only branches out for oscar bait roles. He could be amazing if he let go a bit more.",oyxaam
h82zj1c,Will smith isn't the right tone for a suicide squad movie.,oyxaam

h7wrn74,"Also, him being a friend of Rick Flagg is said far more than it's ever shown.  Almost like that entire relationship was developed offscreen, or in perhaps another (much worse) movie...",oyxaam
h7wqnym,"Exactly. With Bloodsport's story being one of the major focuses of the story, I'm guessing they couldn't exactly just completely change it. They picked a character that they could use and simply change a few details, and came up with a different way to play the personality, to make him feel distinct enough without changing much of the underlying details.",oyxaam
h7ymtyn,Enjoy Edris Elba in this way more than I did Will Smith in the last film. Admittedly this one was a lot better.,oyxaam
h7yb35n,The sense I got from it was she knew what it was and was just incredulous to see it in this hyper advance government building.,oyxaam

h88oopr,His helmet / helmet-voice was sick,oyxaam

h836f02,She didn't recognize bloodsport and he had his mask on. She recognized Rick. She even called bloodsport Milton,oyxaam
h851a44,"I'm seeing a lot of weird comments suggesting Will Smith isn't a good actor here. He's a great actor. He's great at certain things, and Idris is great at other things. I think both actors could have brought something great to this movie in different ways, but I simply thought that Bloodsport felt a bit more fresh to the team, personality wise.",oyxaam
h80c52l,True,oyxaam
h864amd,Yes!,oyxaam
h80hjrf,"It was a rewrite. Originally, Will Smith was supposed to be back but there were scheduling issues, so they had to rewrite the script slightly with a new character. It was changed enough that it felt different to a degree, but you can very much tell that the core of that story came from Deadshot. As someone else mentioned, there was even a familiarity with Flagg and Harley",oyxaam

h80zyz4,"That whole fight scene felt like the choreographers took a step back and just let Cena fight like a WWE superstar, and Gunn had a great idea to make it look as awesome as it should on the big screen.",oyxaam
h89fkpp,"I noticed that, and appreciated it. The people who shot and choreographed that scene had a proper understanding of what John Cena does naturally and well, and they showcased it.",oyxaam
h8932zc,Different  but not amazing. Seemed artsy for no reason,oyxaam
h7xo7df,"The fight was shot normally and then rendered as a reflection off a virtual helmet using the shot as environment-based lighting. Honestly pretty simple in comparison to the rest of the CGI in this film.

I'm always surprised they didn't do something similar for the doorknob scene in The Matrix.",oyxaam
h82bvs0,"And I was like, ""Oh... the helmet is CGI in this shot. Huh.""

I keep thinking back to that Rocketjump video about ""why is CGI so bad"" and yeah, there's a lot of well-used CG in this movie. I'm sick of fucking energy beams and turnkey ""wow it's a billion particles that must be hard to render hurrdurr"" type effects.",oyxaam
h82c4ka,"Yeah I ended up missing a lot of the fight because I was looking at the helmet instead of through it.

But can I also point out that in other fight scenes, I could see what was happening? Almost none of that ""cut-cut-cut-cut-cut' shit. You can see who is where, what they're looking at, and what they're doing.

I feel like comic book movies used to half-ass that.",oyxaam
h834znr,"Yeah, my friends and I talked about it. It goes on long enough that I was getting excited for it to be, like, a 2-minute continuous fight shown in the reflection; it needed to be like a 5-second shot or the whole sequence. 20 Seconds was just an awkward amount.",oyxaam
h87d9cv,"Yeah I wasn't a fan of that shot, it was definitely new and different, but it really just made it so you couldn't see what was going on.",oyxaam
h892im0,Discovery and Warner Bros haven’t finished merging yet. Wait for that to finish before we get that synergy.,oyxaam
h7wok84,And I spent the whole movie wondering why Waller was willing to sacrifice Flag like that and not put him in with the A team. That came back around in a major way at the end with Peacemaker's reveal and then everything made sense.,oyxaam

h7xhhxp,"High profile? You're talking at best B listers, and that's being very generous.",oyxaam
h80wup5,Wish they had an introduction montage or something so that the deaths were more shocking,oyxaam
hnbqiq4,"I think the point is that they weren't assets. Flagg, Boomerang and Harley were shown to be unreliable and prone to dissent in the last mission/movie. TDK and Javelin had lame powers that couldn't really be utilized. Weasel and orange lady were too unpredictable/unwieldy. And Pete Davidson and Savant are too cowardly. Waller basically wanted an opportunity to weed out supervillains that were of no use while freeing up prison space/money for potential new Suicide Squad members. 

Take Weasel drowning. Since the audience is still being misdirected, you're supposed to look at Waller's face and think she's saying *you idiots didn't research if Weasel could swim or not!?* When in reality she's saying *finally, we got rid of the fucking Weasel.* The calculated part is, if the A team somehow did competently take out the army, that's all the better. I guess what wasn't anticipated was Harley and Flagg making it out alive. 

Also, sorry for replying months later. I just watched the movie and am late to the party.",oyxaam

h85ltip,"I remember thinking the same. Not necessarily that it was a dream sequence, but when we flashed back days earlier, I thought we'd spend more time with all the characters as Waller assembles them, maybe the have a training montage then we'd see what was the movie's opening about mid way through and we kinda got that...but only for Bloodsport's team 😂😂",oyxaam

h7wezam,"I legitimately did not expect to care about fucking rats, but that line almost made me tear up. It was so simple yet poignant.",oyxaam
h84djkq,"What a phenomenal scene that points to an underlying theme of the film and Rat Catcher’s ethos (which is why she is so quick to befriend everyone). And look what happens as a result of that personal ethos. King shark goes with them to fight Starro because he’s going to follow his “friends”, and Bloodsport, a real loner who doesn’t give a shit about most people, goes out of his way to save Cleo at least twice in the third act (from Peacemaker then from one of Starro’s legs).

My eyes were starting to water during that whole scene. By far, one of my most favorite scenes in a DC/Marvel movie. Thanks James Gunn for making me care more about a girl who controls rats (and her pet rat) than any hero in the DC universe.",oyxaam
h7wtj47,The movie with the giant shark man voring a dude had me choking up at the end. What a movie.,oyxaam

h7wj5ev,I thought it was because she used to sleep on the streets so now she just sleeps in cosy spots whenever she has the chance,oyxaam
h7wtvwc,"If it's intentional, it's probably because her father was addicted to heroin and would ""go to sleep"" a lot, and so she picked up the habit of napping whenever she thought he did.  She loves him, despite his addiction, and so the sleeping habit became a safe space from her childhood, instead of a major trauma.    


I wouldn't read this far into it but they literally fucking show us the more psychotic characters' worlds, from Polka-Dot Man's mom to Harley's flower blood.  I don't really think a detail of random naps would be a random choice, because it works too damn well with her childhood and how heroin addiction works.    


I mean, I also make this connection because I personally know someone that picked up such a habit from their parent being a user, but it was out of trauma, so it's definitely a thing.",oyxaam

h856p2a,"I agree and kind of disagree. She was my favorite member of the team. But, I think her getting less screen time made it more satisfying when she pretty much took out Starro on her own.",oyxaam

Margot is always great as Harley, Joel got to do Rick Flag right, and boomer makes me sad. I'm fine he died, but its the only role I ever liked Jai Cortney in. Plus I wish we got a proper moment with him and the flash. Overall fantastic movie.",oyxaam
h7x6pbl,"I think - of all the incredible performances and characters - Viola Davis knocked it out of the *PARK*, and Gunn wrote - in the midst of a movie full of over-exaggerated characters and scenes - the most subtle characterization in Amanda Waller.

And I agree, Amanda Waller *at the beginning of the movie* had absolutely no compunctions about killing off *anyone* (in fact, I'm certain that she picked the ""A"" squad deliberately, as people who were *almost* out of the Task Force X program, just to keep it secret) and was WELL on her way to becoming the very thing she despises: a Mindless Bureaucrat, happy to play the game with no concerns about... well, anything but herself.

By the end though - thanks to a well-placed concussion - she was beginning to realize how far down the Road Of No Return she'd actually gone by the end of the movie, and what a wake up call it was. I mean, she let her underlings live, FFS... and we all know she's killed for less.",oyxaam

In this version, all the characters are interesting so we don't get that effect. Harley's still fun, but so is everyone else.",oyxaam

h7wronx,"That slow pan of her sitting in her office staring at the oblivious staff members had me nervous. We saw what Waller did to Flag, Harley, and Boomerang in the opening sequence. Clearly she had held some grudges from the first movie after Flag disobeyed her orders and Harley defected from the original suicide squad in her attempt to reunite with the Joker. Waller probably never got over it and was willing to sacrifice them the next chance she got. So I’m worried for these poor staff members who were only trying to do the right thing.",oyxaam

Not that she wont punish them though",oyxaam

h7w3s4y,"Tough call, it certainly up there. I really enjoyed WW and the less popular around here, MOS.",oyxaam
h89fwmz,"I think it also does a good job of matching the tone I often got from DC comics and animated shows like Justice League, where comic universes are full of bizarre fun things that are also dark and scary as fuck. It's difficult to capture that because it's such a thin line and most films end up being more dark and serious (Burton, Nolan, Snyder, Watchmen, Joker) or more funny and fun (much of the MCU, Shazam), but rarely do they pull off riding the line (though Deadpool comes close too).",oyxaam
h831fr3,How do you make a good DC movie? Just hire Marvel directors and actors.,oyxaam

h84r4ye,"There's a certain innocence to his character that made me feel for him. He's a shark-man. He eats living things. It's just what sharks do. He is incapable of understanding why that is wrong, but feels bad about it all the same. He is a monster who eats people, but there is no malice in him at all.",oyxaam

h7wyls9,The reason Feige works for the MCU is because he is a **producer**. It's so fucking dumb when people want directors to take on that role and even dumber that people want the DCEU to have one singular vision exactly like the MCU.

I also liked her falling for the guy, if only for the fact it allowed us to see that she truly *is* the Harley that won't take shit from anyone trying to manipulate her in a relationship. Which is my absolute favorite Harley, the one that would fuck up Joker's day if she so much as found out they were on the same block together.

h7wedhy,"Because whether people want to admit it or not, Gunn is firmly entrenched in the Marvel film playbook of respecting the origins of the characters, but making them relatable enough to  be a hit with regular folks who then forget about the characters less than believable quirks or attributes.

A sentient tree doesn’t work. Especially one that utters only 3 words in different provocation. 

But anyone who has a special needs person in their life - especially one that is non-verbal and communicates differently - can tell you that love doesnt always need words. And a sentient tree who just wanted to fit in, communicates through tone and emotion; who just wanted to have a family is easily, and wholeheartedly relatable. And a talking raccoon doesn’t work either. But a character who was abused and as a result, has a huge chip on their shoulder who also doesn’t fit in - yet is super sarcastic to hide that vulnerability? Again, very relatable.

A living planet doesn’t work. Especially as an antagonist. But a living planet that manifests itself as an egotistical (no pun intended) narcissistic who simply procreated as a means to have a prize offspring but never actually do anything for it or care for it or own up to the responsibility of that action? Well for many, that’s super relatable and easily believable as an antagonist because there’s plenty of them in real life.

h89ac51,It's kind of sad that this is the first enjoyable film with Harley in it that's not total garbage.  The first SS movie needs no further elaboration but Birds of Prey was just so forgettable.  It's like they were waffling about it being a full-blown Harley movie and just half-assed it with the rest of the female hero cast tossed in as an afterthought.  Really goes to show that the Harley character really needs a strong and well-written ensemble to bounce off of so that she doesn't end up chewing the scenery.,oyxaam

Madness also allows some people to operate beyond the usual limits, and an extreme lack of impulse control can translate into being very decisive.

The US could even get a nice PR boost (especially locally) if they decided to deal with it themselves.

But the part that stands out is Yondu's funeral at the very end. The whole time, I remember saying to myself, ""don't cut to comedy, don't cut to comedy"" and they didn't and it was *great*. Perfect bittersweet ending to the movie. They didn't ruin the moment. I've never understood the dislike for GotG2. I liked it more than the first one because I felt more attached to the characters.

Contrast that with Thor Ragnarok, which people seem to love. It has the exact same immature comedy (Hulk's dick, ""The Devil's Anus"", Mjolnir ""getting Thor off"") and during its emotional climax, when Asgard is being destroyed, they're cracking jokes non-stop. Thor also doesn't seem to care that his friends died. For two such similar movies, I'll never understand while GotG2 gets treated as a letdown while Ragnarok is hailed as a masterpiece when they do the exact same shit (and Ragnarok does it worse).",oyxaam
h86d72l,"The scene also helps to solidify Flagg as a likeable guy, just in time for them to have him killed off.  I think without the Harley Quinn escape stuff I wouldn't have cared as much about Flagg dying, which just makes the difference between it and your falling rock example even wider.

Usually its just like, blowing off super villains heads and shit, which is fucked up, but not REALLY fucked up. But willing to sacrifice an entire country? Willing to purposely threaten a mans daughter and knowing in your bones that she'd do it too?

That's The Wall Amanda Waller. She's no saint. She's practices Peacemakers line perfectly. She loves peace, and will absolutely kill as many many women and children as it takes to get it, and she'll do it with a god damn smile on her face and have 0 issues sleeping at night after doing it.",oyxaam

I think he sees himself as a serious actor trapped in a ""monsters body"".

They are all great on their own, i wouldnt compare them. Cena has yet to break through, but i think he is getting there. With the Fast & Furious movie, Suicide Squad and his own Peacemaker series he will probably rocket to the sky.",oyxaam
h7wlr0u,Cena in train wreck was amazingly funny too.,oyxaam
h7w5f0l,To be fair he ran circle around Rock on the mic during the lead up to their first WrestleMania match. The line about Rock having to write his lines on his hand was brutal,oyxaam
h7wgneu,I had the same reaction.  It felt like a weird choice considering what went down and how recent that was.,oyxaam

h7wpz44,Still has a brain bomb tho right?,oyxaam
h89en5n,"Yeah exactly it's kind of weird to have a villain like The Thinker without having the main characters fall into his trap. 

Again like you it doesn't ruin the movie for me but it's a weird choice to have a villain like that for what is essentially your Generic Evil Scientist Type. 

He doesn't even seem *that* clever to be honest you'd expect him to at least have one plan to escape even of he's an ordinary person.",oyxaam
h8bhk0y,He'll probably do one more Guardians and bounce from Marvel and Disney. I wouldn't want to keep working for a place that doesn't have my back. I'm sure he has some resentment towards them for dropping him. Be great to see him handle the DC properties. I'm kinda done with the Zack Snyder dark superhero world.,oyxaam

h8gz52m,Worth it!,oyxaam
h8tba4b,"I mean, Waller placed Quinn in the first team so she was supposed to die. The only reason Waller knew Flag survived was because his tracker was still working? So its possible Waller had every reason to assume Quinn had died; if not on the beach then in the possession of the regime? The electrocution tortute could've short circuited whatever plants were in Quinn. The best way to confirm would be to watch again and see whether Quinn's bio stats back at Belle Reve HQ indicated if she deceased or not",oyxaam

Chris Evans would be hilarious though.",oyxaam
h7x5xei,"I mean, it didn’t have to be be anyone. Considering he wasn’t even Clifford DeVoe or Desmond Conner, it could’ve just been an original character named “Dr. Gaius Greeves.” It’s not like they used any of his powers or did anything unique to the Thinker. They didn’t even use his name. Gunn seemed to make the character the Thinker just for the aesthetics of the head things, which weren’t even explained. Just felt like a waste of a great character.",oyxaam

I've never heard that phrase before (""I have a dinosaur that eats forcefield dogs"") but I understood the conversation was basically ""I have a bigger dick"" but I think it seems backwards.

But yes his turn against Waller made sense (killed kids) but it just happened so quick. ( which seemed like a common thing in this movie very little fat). 

But as much as I liked Flagg I enjoyed what they ultimately did with his character. Mostly because of the impact it had on peacemaker, you could tell deep down he didn’t want to do it but had to follow the orders or his “code” almost like Rorsach in Watchmen, almost. 

Definitely made peacemaker a favourite character. Subverted expectations big time. And can’t wait for the tv show.",oyxaam

I kinda wished they wrapped up some of the setup, like what happened with Bloodsport's daughter's court date, or how Waller felt about the mission's results (after going so hard for the entire movie about it), or what happened to Harley, etc - there was a lot of unresolved or unspoken loose ends at the end.",oyxaam
h84w2rc,"Character building. They don't make you care about any of the characters at any point really more than like a five second scene.

Great imagery and cinematics, and a decent soundtrack.",oyxaam

h82oqq1,"I read all the suicide squad comics as a kid, I love silly, gory, grindhouse-y over-the-top movie kills and all that shit. Gratuitous violence is an inherent source of bathos, and bathos is the root of most comedy.

That said, I thought the movie was kinda weak. I think it was undermined by a few performances and production decisions. I thought John Cena was atrocious. 

I thought the revolving door of villains was just strange.

 A man called ""the thinker"" had no plan or escape method or attempt to create some devious plot. 

I thought the jokes were largely out of character, and tending towards Joss Whedon territory. Where you feel that the comedy is coming from the WRITER, not from the characters. Its almost like non-diegetic humour. Jokes the audience might laugh at, but nothing you feel the characters would actually say. 

I thought Harley Quinn was bolted on quite frankly. She didn't really have a role to play as part of the group dynamic. She wasn't actually in the group for 75% of the film. Additionally I find her character grating at the best of times, it reminds me far to much of ""lol random"" internet shite circa 2008. ""*I'm walking back and forth!*"" etc.. fuckin gimme a break. 

Overall it was fun, and I appreciate the idea, but it all still felt a little TOO cookie cutter, I could feel the corporate touch, and even though it was R-rated it felt like it was aimed at children. And it kinda was because it was aimed at adult manchildren, lets be real here.",oyxaam

h7y0sfp,"The movie rubbed me the wrong way. My complaint points:

* I don't like ""comedic manchildren"", so the early Bloodsport vs Peacemaker clashing was really grating. For comparison, Will Ferrell often plays unflappable characters like this. For contrast, I'd consider Homelander to be an example of a manchild with depth and more understandable reasons for what he does. Harley also hit these notes sometimes too.
* It felt like the violence was a bit gratuitous. I'll contrast again to The Boys, which I feel does a better job of having violence when it's necessary to the story.
* Similarly, the swearing seemed over the top, and that the story was just doing it because it could in an R rating.
* Bloodsport's dynamic with his daughter felt really toxic, and for her to seem to lighten up so much to him on the TV felt unrealistic. Bloodsport was willing to save her from Belle Reve, but it feels like bridges have already been burned and the earth has already been salted on the father-daughter front. We could also see it coming a mile away, which made confirmation even more painful.
* I'm partial to the gruff mentor role that Peacemaker played in the start of the Jaime Reyes Blue Beetle run, so seeing him as a comedic manchild here was a bit painful.

By the time we got to the club, we were both really burnt out and started fast forwarding through parts. Which was a shame because the bits I saw after often seemed much better. I'll definitely have to watch it the rest of the way through without skips at some point, but not right now. I'm tired and disappointed.",oyxaam

Ill Call it a ""lie"" or at least desingenous when IGN and some fanboy gives it a 9 out of 10 and calls it a masterpiece, its going too far and ignoring flaws that make it objectively average, i can like a  movie a lot and i have a lot of guilty pleasures, but if those movies are not very good even though i like them, i can see call out the flaws and admit as much from an objective perspective, i think objectivity is whats lacking on ppls minds these days and critics, its a easy way out to give something praise that you like while beeing blinded by it.",oyxaam

h8jk58n,"You seemingly went into the film with the right viewpoint to enjoy it. I personally believe this film was made to appeal specifically to non-fans of suicide squad. As an ""over the top satire"" it has its merits as a somewhat humorous (but still majorly flawed) comedy, that would have worked better (for me) as a standalone concept unrelated to suicide squad. That seems like it was James Gunn's vision, anyway, as none of the characters in the main cast shared anything with their comic book counterpart besides for their names. It quickly became clear to me that each character was selected for a specific punchline in the film, and had nothing to do with the characters original personality, powers, etc.

I can totally understand why others enjoyed this film if they knew nothing about any of these characters at all. Ironically, DC Comics published two new suicide squad collections, called ""case files"" 1 and 2, that detail the origin story of all the characters in the film, and which serves mostly to highlight the major discrepancies between comic and movie. Its like no one told DC that they were throwing away all that backstory that was being used to advertise the film. Anyone who has read these books and then sees the new film, as I did, will likely have a similar reaction of ""wtf did i just watch"".

I've always recognized David Ayer's suicide squad as a flawed, and usually just try to convince others that there had been a good movie in there somewhere originally before it was edited to all hell. There is an ""extended"" edition of the film with only 9 extra minutes, but in just those few moments you easily see that we got 50% or less of what the original film was supposed to be. It seems a lot of scenes went on much longer then we ever saw, with added dialogue that helped build the relationship of the squad. There was also entire plot lines cut that included more joker, harley, and batman at a minimum. The amount of joker content cut alone was multiple hours worth, supposedly. I always enjoyed Leto's joker (another controversial opinion, I know) as another interesting interpretation out of many that I've enjoyed. I'm sure others would have had a more positive reception to the character if they'd gotten more screen time.

Everyone on Flagg's team was *supposed* to die on insertion.      
It was both a diversion and a means to clean house.     

Flagg, Harley, and Boomerang Dude defied Waller in SS1 and she's petty and vengeful. 
Also, I don't think Waller had handles on Flagg anymore.  
(I can't recall, did Enchantress die? If so, then she had no leverage on Flagg anymore.)   

Look at the calibre of Flaggs team:      

* TDK and Weasel weren't practical choices, so no loss.   
* Mongal was a loose cannon. That chopper stunt made her a team killer.  
* Savant and Javelin weren't particularly useful, so they were also highly expendable.   
* Blackguard was included so that he *could* betray them.  Think about it, it should not have been difficult to sequester prison inmates before a top secret mission.

Shazam was cute, but nothing memorable. Not saying it’s a bad movie.

AquaMan was bland for 60-70 percent of its runtime, IMO.

Wonder Woman had the blandest action sequences I’ve seen and the last fight looked like it was directed by Michael Bay. I also just don’t like Gal Gadot as a person, she just comes off as insufferable 

James Gunn has a really impressive mix of sound, visuals, and spirit in his movies. The characters are memorable and distinct and none of it felt cookie cutter. Maybe I’m sucking his dick too much but the Harley escape seen was really wholesome and fun. The use of the Javalin to kill the Starro followed by the infestation of rats into the eye really set the tone of a suicide squad feel. It was just a really cool set piece I haven’t seen.

They wanted us to care. They didn't add those backstories for nothing, giving us that last shot of Waititi during the climax to drive her story home. It just wasn't enough to make it effective IMO.",oyxaam
h92jwgu,They’re totally expendable. That’s the point. If they don’t follow orders then they are useless.,oyxaam
h8uj2pc,Yeah exactly. She has a team that actually pulled off a suicide mission.. Makes sense to keep them alive.,oyxaam
h8ajvpt,"And the guy who made The Joker also made The Hangover. Turns out directors aren't robots who can only ever produce the same content. And while SS and GOTG were very tonally similar (GOTG also has some of the better humor in the MCU), I found SS to have a lot more organic humor and be less quippy, relying on humorous situations as opposed to characters telling jokes, and the number of jokes was also much lower as well.",oyxaam

h84vys0,"I understand your viewpoint 80 percent. But I feel like it hurt the film drastically when all the deaths are in the beginning. No one died in the middle of the movie and Milton, Flag, Thinker, and PDM died at the end.

I would’ve just killed off TDK and Weasel in the beginning (I know Weasel survives, I would’ve killed him as there has to be at least some deaths in the beginning), Blackguard could’ve double crossed them later on and have died. Mongal and Javelin could’ve died somewhere along that also before the final act. 

Flag dying sucked but I think I would keep it in as it develops Peacemaker potentially. I’d replace Polka Dot Man dying and keep him alive and Captain Boomerang could die a badass death which he deserves or better yet survive for Flash movie.",oyxaam
h84zupw,I think Deadpool 2 pulled it off better. We knew alot of squad members were going to die nobody expected them to do Xforce like that. I do feel like it would have been a better decision to save some of those early deaths for the middle act,oyxaam

h84p2g2,"Haha I agree. But after about the fourth time it coming up, It felt like such a jab at the response to old jokes he made that even he admits are and were pretty tasteless. 

And in a movie of villains, you gotta separate the death validation somehow. And, “that guy kills kids” will always be a fast track to the audience accepting that death.",oyxaam

There’s nothing wrong with not liking it, but why on earth are you going out of your way to convince yourself that people are buying reviews or paying bots or lying to themselves? It’s as though the fact of you not liking it means you can’t conceive that *other* people like it, so you assign a bunch of cynical motives to them. *Your* opinion must be correct and everyone else must be full of shit, because there’s no *way* you could stray so far from the consensus.

The amount of plot armor Harley Quinn gets is annoying,killing characters off is easy,killing characters which people have emotionally invested in and carries weight is the real hard part.

Bad villain, bad writing,bad screenplay and bad humour and no emotional weight whatsoever has all the elements of a kids movie.",oyxaam

We know Krypronthe is the only power against Superman, so the character is crafty enough to trick Superman around a kryptonit’e bullet.  Superman? The guy with the Super hearing? The guy “faster than a speeding bullet?” And what hospital ICU is prepared to actually treat Superman’s alien physiology. “COME ON, MAN!” This is way off the realm of any universe or reality.

h7xvn40,It had its moments though. Like the scene where Lawton shows off why he's called 'Deadshot'.,oyxaam
h7yjyzl,Rated r for retarded,oyxaam
h7womym,It's still capeshit.,oyxaam
h7xbd63,So it's another form of capeshit.,oyxaam
h80xa85,Then why did they spend so much time giving me tonal whiplash by getting all sentimental with her character going into that stupid history with her dad?,oyxaam
h81r0je,"Honestly, I expected dark and gritty. The comedic feel to it felt cringey.",oyxaam
h81qyvi,"YES!


Finally recognized for that. Thanks boo.",oyxaam

h84rbtn,Will Smith is the OG.,oyxaam
h82e5yy,"That is true we never see him dead on screen. 

His torso never gets shot, Javelin is the one whos torso get's shot up. The last time we see TDK he is coughing up blood on his back, just before that we see him listed as critical on the monitors, and you briefly see his injuries next to that picture, the only red marks are on his shoulders.",oyxaam

h8f5dyp,"So basically and unlikeable jerk. Him thinking he's a good guy is irrelevant, Bin Laden thought of him as the good guy as well lmfao. PM is just a deranged psycho with 0 good qualities, that's literally the point of his character in the movie, nothing good about him, even when he hesitated slightly he still killed Rick Flag, he still almost killed Ratcatcher 2.0 if it wasn't for Bloodsport, how y'all like him I'll never understand, I fell like Punisher is what Peacemaker would wish to be but Punisher is done right. And keeps peace my ass, even Flag said ""what a joke"" to that mantra lol.",oyxaam

h88npga,What was flag on that team though? I get her being sick of Harleys shit possibly but why flag?,oyxaam
h88qeib,Waller probably sent Rick in hoping he wouldn’t make it. If Rick dies in the beginning Peacemaker would (maybe) had to only kill Bloodsport to get the drive.  As the other redditor pointed out the only reason Team 2 was sent to rescue Flagg was most likely to kill the freedom fighters.,oyxaam
h93wxfq,I have a hard time accepting this considering she stuck Nathan Fillion’s detachable arms on team 1. I struggle to imagine how he would’ve been useful in an armed combat scenario even if things went well,oyxaam
h9l0shi,I disagree. I think Team 2 was put together with way more thought into team dynamics and potential teamwork.,oyxaam
h8lkee1,"Yeah, my read was that Team 1 became the decoy team when everything went to hell for them. Not that that was the original plan. She just decided to cut her losses and roll with it.",oyxaam

I was born in 1998 and have only seen him in Encino Man and Bio-Dome as a kid and he was horrifically annoying and unfunny in both. I thought everyone agreed with that when I saw his self-deprecating appearance in Futurama. 

Maybe he's a good standup, but from his movie appearances only I thought he was basically a less successful Rob Schneider.",oyxaam

h84toc0,"Asked This elsewhere here, but why all the Pete Davidson hate? I know there’s a lot of it but I never really understood the reason.",oyxaam
h8brmpl,Same dude. Idk even without seeing the trailers I still would have called him dying pretty early in the movie.,oyxaam
h80utlp,True but when Waller was talking to Bloodsport it seemed like she knew in advance that the double cross would happen,oyxaam
h84iz0b,"I assume Waller probably set it in motion for him to be able to contact someone while in jail, explaining how he did it and how she might have known.",oyxaam
h8d45dl,Waller planned on him to double cross. It's why the diversion worked so well.,oyxaam
h8ipkki,"My headcanon for how blackguard doublecrossed them is Waller ""accidentally"" leaving a cellphone where Blackguard could steal it, with ""Squealy Willie, villainous fixer for cheap"" on speed-dial.",oyxaam
h8za2dz,I have to assume he was supposed to give them up. Otherwise it's just a weird unnecessary coincidence that doesn't add anything to the movie.,oyxaam
h86omi9,"I just like how much of a subversion it was from typical tropes. It’s so easy to see how a less ambitious, shittier movie would just turn it into a plot point where they go to save Harley and have to have her realize the dude’s bad… but nope, she picks up on it right away and doesn’t hesitate a second. It was still a big deal to the plot, and felt worth while, while also *not* being that big of a deal. 

In general there’s a lot of that kinda thing in this movie, just creative ways of playing out story bits that seem, on a surface level, kind of played out. And as a result, it feels far more artistically driven, rather than just being the new superhero movie product #153",oyxaam
h899mqr,"To be fair, she only drew the line at children",oyxaam
h8h73jt,"I doubt that? I feel like he’d watch the movies to know where she’s at. Although maybe he just got the info he needed from her or the writers or something, either way, seems unlikely that he didn’t know about it.",oyxaam
h8ehy1w,Classic shmosby,oyxaam
h899rgm,"Too bad we still had the stupid ""we have guns but we'll run right into her"" idiot ball",oyxaam
h8ezskq,"To clarify I like the character of Harley Quinn, just wasn't a fan of the cinematic interpretation until recently. I have to get around to watching the cartoon, I've heard good things about it.",oyxaam
h8j8mjh,"I'll stand by the cartoon as well. It has geat character arcs, not to mention it's really fucking funny.",oyxaam
h8azap7,Because he did such a great job with the First suicide squad movie lol.,oyxaam
h8q08ru,Can WB hire Lake Bell to play Poison Ivy and like 30% of the Harley cartoon writers and someone to slap him around when he makes it too grimdark?,oyxaam
h8zmbm3,"HAHAHAHA ""She wasn't romantically involved with Weasel"" idk but that made me laugh irl",oyxaam
h8fxu5d,I knew she was fine during the torture.  I figured that a trained psychologist who was in a mentally and physically abusive relationship with the Joker would hold up well to any form of torture... maybe even find some pleasure in it.,oyxaam
hcp4i6v,"It was supposed to be absurd, it all happens over one afternoon! Though I did find it weird that the President character seemed to ultimately be sincere about Harley where it seemed at first that it was setting him up as manipulating her",oyxaam
h8pvlzr,"That actually surprised me, Gunn originally described his character as having different powers, that his arms just grew back after popping out. 

I thought he would just have a scene where he relentlesly shoots his arms at people with grenades in them or something and someone would just blow up his leg and he'd comically bleed to death and scream about how terrible it is to lose a limb......",oyxaam
h9nzwz6,omg i just realized that was Fillion,oyxaam
h8iph68,*slap slap - slap slap*,oyxaam
hagt3cb,"Yeah, that was vintage James Gunn humor. I'm done with seeing superhero movies on the big screen, but Gunn has managed to retain the humor of his Tromeo & Juliet in his mainstream flicks, seeing his Suicide Squad at the theater was a real treat. The movie felt decadent AF, and that's it's strength.",oyxaam
h8w22x3,The exchange Elba and Cena had after the exploding bullet gave me the biggest laugh,oyxaam
h8rzey8,That scene felt weird from the start.,oyxaam
h96c86f,When the freedom fighters leader just silently stands in the middle of the camp looking at all the dead bodies while the suicide squad stands behind her like a bunch of kids who know they messed up and are about to get grounded.,oyxaam
h8ub1il,It feels like a guilty pleasure funny moment or something. I was like i wanna laugh but should I? I still did tho cuz haha funny unexpected subversion.,oyxaam
h8z5mb6,"Same, that one was unexpected (at least for me) and probably the funniest scene in the movie",oyxaam
h8bqec0,Yes it was somewhat funny first time but then again each to their own,oyxaam
h8bf7vj,"""They killed Milton!""

""I thought he was waiting at the bus what the hell was Milton gonna do?""

Just perfect",oyxaam
h8qiv85,I was dying when they went into the building and Milton is just following behind them,oyxaam
h8bjtd9,Underrated cameo from Sean Gunn,oyxaam
ha7ysmc,When King Shark is sitting against the tree after trying to eat  Ratcatcher 2. Then she summons all of the rats for the first time. You see them crawl past Bloodsports feet and his toe is sticking out of his sock.,oyxaam
h8bfolh,"I love when something happens in a movie that makes you go ""what the fuck?"" Then a character verbalizes that. Never gets old",oyxaam
h88sajo,"I'm not criticizing the character, merely commenting on the ""rules"" to comedy and such.",oyxaam
h88tnhw,"Exactly.

It's the kind of line that has ""shock value"" and is a perfectly fine line by itself.  But when the movie begins with a gruesome head shot of a supposed protagonist and already establishes clearly that vulgar words and gestures are the norm... well, that kinda line loses a lot of power and offers almost no shock value anymore.

Again, most humor comes from subverting expectations.

In the trailer, you can catch the audience off guard.  At that point in movie, not so much.

And, for what it's worth, I didn't even know it was in trailer.  I figured Gunn was doing the film and that was good enough for me, so completely avoided trailer...",oyxaam
h89064o,"Also, Elba looks great smoking a ciggie",oyxaam
h8ebnnz,Storm Reid was poised to be a big star in Ava DuVernay's A Wrinkle In Time and that didn't turn out well.,oyxaam
h98h4rz,For real. That trope suckkkkks,oyxaam
h852tlk,Well that explains Black Widows budget of 200 million vs the budget of The Suicide Squad with 175 million.,oyxaam
h8eqnju,"Oh, no complaints at all about King Shark. They did a fantastic job on the CGI. I hope they win some awards for it because both their direction and execution was fantastic. But part of that is not going the hyperrealism that our brains go ""that looks wrong"".",oyxaam
h8rbj8o,I hope we get a better version of Killer Croc at some point. He was absolutely TERRIFYING in the Arkham games. I want to see that Croc on the big screen vs King Shark,oyxaam
h990uc2,"Small detail but I love how in the shot where he's sitting alone in the van, his fin wipes against the fogged up window",oyxaam
h8awxj0,"i mean the Flash' Shark was still awesome. But because they tried to make it too good, it's also blowing their budget lmao.",oyxaam
h8cz801,"That tends to go the other way. Infact, a lot of the issues with DC up until this point has been the hyperrealisation of their characters and changes in costumes to appear more edgy and muted. 

This is really the first movie that embraced things like Shark and Starro. Before this, we have got stuff like Ares and Steppenwolfe. Guys with unique designs that were instead stripped down to ""grey thing with horned helmet"". Meanwhile, Marvel made one of it's movies based around a Racoon and Tree, and whose big bad guy was a giant purple man.

Given that DC comics tend to be more fantastical in nature, their movies haven't been until The Suicide Squad",oyxaam
h8hiocy,"Comics? Yes.

Films? No.

Perhaps that's why their success in both is inverted.",oyxaam
h99ihkg,It did look very fake but it also reminded me of a gore shot from a Troma movie so it worked for me.,oyxaam
h8zndd9,Yeah his durability was actually really interesting. A whole section of a building fell on him and he kinda just shrugged it off.,oyxaam
hxe0hnk,"So how the F. does Waller get him in a pretty normal looking prison ? Pokadotman had a power dampener, but that was also his only power, pretty easy to kill, but a shark demigod ? Besides JL and when i mean the i mean Superman/Wonder Woman, who else could even knock him out ? I don't think Aquaman could, especially with his power showcase. The flash ? Not this one.  


I can roll with no explanation is better than bad one, but lol...",oyxaam
h84ys8r,"I assumed they were automatic, part of their implants",oyxaam
h8hl19j,Do you think Waller killed the girl that knocked her out lol?,oyxaam
h864awx,Another member is still alive.,oyxaam
h86614s,There's a scene after the credits,oyxaam
h8a46iu,"I thought the show was a prequel, apparently not?",oyxaam
h8b4db5,"Yea, but it had been described as an origins show",oyxaam
h8ac98m," Exactly. I don't know when I quit watching. I'll rewatch it soon 

 It just wasn't the same. I loved Mackle in the Falcon and Winter Soldier but in AC? Nope.",oyxaam
h8hr9qa," I have to watch it then. If he was my teacher in HS I would be like yes sir, no sir, due to how intense he can look. Haha. 

 I like him in roles and he and the Punisher need to get a series. A mini series on whatever with whatever as long as they are intense!",oyxaam
h8hmldg,"I dunno, not sure if it's been officially said. I could believe they *said* it was going to be a prequel so as not to spoil him surviving, but anything I heard prior to seeing the movie I figured was all just rumor and speculation.",oyxaam
h7wsbue,"Hey, if Mortal Kombat X-Rays will let me stab someone in the head and then still have to fight them for the other half their health bar, I'm sure Flagg could survive.

Warner Bros be like that.",oyxaam
h8524qi,I’m just wondering why they do the whole heart thing to not keep him alive. Knife to the chest you’re dead. Did they need to spend 2 million in CGI to confirm that? It was odd. I was expecting something to come of that.,oyxaam
h7wm60c,"Is that actually happening, or is it like the Channing Tatum ""Gambit"" movie that's totally still in the works?",oyxaam
h7wjovu,Probably for the best there were no callbacks to that “first” one,oyxaam
h83843l,"I have nothing wrong with the scene. I have everything wrong with the character being alive after killing Flag and only being stopped from killing Ratcatcher by a bullet to the jugular (killed by the very thing he sassed Bloodsport with in the prison). 

Peacemaker was the worst of them! The ABSOLUTE worst! Okay, Waller may be a tiny bit worse (her not wanting the squad to defeat a kaiju that would threaten the country that tortured it for 30 years seems wildly out of character for a woman who's entire job is threat assessment and elimination), but Peacemaker was the worst Suicide Squad member. 

Even if killing Flagg starts getting him to reconsider his mentality and realize that not everything is black and white (or red, white, and blue, I guess) and that there are better ways to get what you want than just killing everyone (he could've just shot the drive the second Flag pulled it out and been done with it), he was the biggest asshole there, and I bet that isn't going to change no matter what ""character growth"" he gets in the spinoff.",oyxaam
h85ekie,Just as easy to set the tv show in an earlier timeline...,oyxaam
h85r6sa,Say that to Harley Quinn.,oyxaam
h84dhd6,"All we saw were bloody portions of his costume, which given his condition might be all that was left after he was cruahed and whatever virus he had left ate portions of his body.",oyxaam
h84lg7b,It has at least another season. This last season was rough though. Partly due to COVID and partly due to the show trying to address the current climate.,oyxaam
h8533sg,I went the whole movie... well you know not even know that was him.  The rookie?  I immediately think ODST.,oyxaam
h9g7u6d,She wasn't with the others at the end.,oyxaam
h8esge1,"That's the problem with existing in the same world as Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, etc. Leak that some evil bitch is threatening kids to those folks and they should be showing up on Waller's doorstep. :)

Now I'm imagining Christopher Reeve's Superman showing up to deal with her. ""Suicide Squad? That hardly sounds ethical, Ms Waller.""",oyxaam
ha47edk,Thank God YOU'RE not a writer. Really.,oyxaam
h8rkyzb,"So a minor change from ""gets hit by underling with a golf club, lives and scowls at people who did it"" is fine but ""gets shot by underling"" is apparently terrible writing?

Rather than being a smartass, why not give your counter argument with such a change?

I'm not even decrying what they went with, just saying I think Waller being killed instead of knocked out would have served the story better (as would letting Peacemaker stay dead). Obviously you don't think so, but maybe share why?

Oh, and I am, incidentally. :) Unless you mean ""the"" instead of ""a"" which is completely true; I'm not James Gunn, who I am a huge fan of as a writer and director.",oyxaam
h9g7zct,The woman wasn't with the others in the after credits sequence,oyxaam
h9uw9l0,"It made her seem impotent. Also didn't understand why she would care if the suicide squad decided to fight Starro, it's not like his existence was vital to any plan. Worst case she loses some assets, killing them doesn't help the situation.",oyxaam
h9tmhsz,"Thats the thing like- she is more intimidating when she is calm and collected, calculating and playing people like pawns.  

Screaming out of control woman left a bad taste for sure.",oyxaam
h887a6u,I'm convinced that Gunn watched Ratatouille sometime during pre-production and just decided to make Ratcatcher 2's story the heart of the movie.,oyxaam

h80j7j5,He deserved a lot better than a comedic death.,oyxaam
h842b88,"> They did a *really* good job of getting you invested in these characters.

There's honestly a very simple reason for this. Unlike the previous SS movie, the idea that humans have the potential to be good and empathetic isn't framed as some big twist reveal in the latter half of the film, but is treated like a basic fact. That's always one of Gunn's biggest strengths, and that's why the characters felt real instead of caricatures saying cool stuff.",oyxaam
h7z2buq,Polky was too over powered though. I think that's why they had to kill him off.,oyxaam
h8112o5,"Right when he turned and went “I’m a superhero!”, I immediately went “yeah he’s fucking dead”. Squish.",oyxaam
h7ydm0n,Interesting… maybe I was too baked but my fiancé and I were comparing SS to Guardians and we both agreed that we thought SS story was better but we liked the GotG characters better. What does “telegraphed” mean?,oyxaam
h875yfi,"You wanna talk about telegraphed? Polka Dot's death couldn't have been more telegraphed if he was from the 1800s. As soon as he smiled and looked away, I brought up my arm and almost *right* in time with the squishing, brought it down",oyxaam
h838d2i,"That one was so telegraphed I said out 3-4 seconds before that he was gonna be squashed, the shot was just so obvious",oyxaam

h85p5kg,"I dunno I don’t think it was telegraphed that bad. I genuinely didn’t see him dying, when I saw him and peacemaker fighting all I was wondering was if he was gonna spare him at the last second.",oyxaam
h87ay8q,Joel Kinnaman is just that good of an actor. Check out For All Mankind,oyxaam
h88rir1,How was flags death telegraphed?,oyxaam
h8g0zwa,Right? Some TV shows can be 10 episodes long and you get no character development for certain characters and feel nothing when they're killed.,oyxaam
h8lxhf1,"It's probably James Gunn's strongest point, since he basically did the same thing with the Guardians

literally everyone got a story arc with that franchise.",oyxaam

h7wq3jv,Gunn is so damn good at making you emotionally invested in his characters.,oyxaam
h7ws7o9,"Because those had feelings, emotions and ""real life"" problems of some sort. The DC heroes are living mostly upper class, because they are gods of some sort.",oyxaam

h83ribn,Idris Elba was originally cast as Deadshot to replace will Smith but they changed his character in case will Smith wanted to come back as I understand it,oyxaam

I'm just imagining Superman using heat vision to rip away at Starro with ease. The Flash rescuing civilians before they could be controlled, Aquaman and his trident and/or Wonder Woman ripping through Starro's eye. etc. Cyborg assisting Supes and Batman probably uses his tech to analyze the threat or help coordinate the attack.

I say that because ""just going back to floating and staring at the stars"" was always an option for Starro when they released him.

Impeccable writing and unreal understanding of character and story.",oyxaam

So Marvel will never hit the lows that DC has and will hit, but by the same token, they'll never hit the same highs DC has and will hit.

I mean, it's a fun punchline to see that Starro becomes his mother in his eyes, but it's actually nothing we don't already know about him.

Imagine him shouting at Idris, ""I'm a goddamn superhero!"" and then pausing in shock, because he can see Idris's face instead of his mother's. Tears of joy. A moment of blessed relief. ""You're you."" ""I'm what?"" And then SPLAT.",oyxaam

Yeah, I loved that. It shows that she truly doesn't give a fuck about these people but it also established the stakes of being in ""the suicide squad"" in a much better way than the first movie did. 

After having watched it, that setup seems super obvious, and it should've been done in the first movie. However it took James Gunn to actually put it on screen. This movie, along with Judas and the Black Messiah, justified my subscription to HBO Max for the entire year.",oyxaam

h8c5i96,And Harley's along with the idiots lmao,oyxaam
h839pnx,"It made me really hope the ending (even post credits) would be Flag or (if he died) someone else killing Waller right at the end.

h7xq0y0,"Nah, Nathan Fillion dying that soon was what surprised me for some reason.",oyxaam

Would love to have seen him return in this franchise or other DCEU ones a few more times at least first.",oyxaam
h802g89,They were decoys.  Waller set up blackguard to betray them so everyone would be on that beach and the other team could sneak in,oyxaam

h98rx1l,Bloodsport doesn't strike me as the sort to switch ammunition to prove a point. I think he was an unrivaled badass from the beginning and always had smaller bullets.

One of my biggest gripes with the first movie is that there was so much that could've been done his character, and it seemed that they made him regress in certain circumstances.

But if Rat Catcher wasn't there at the end to sort of sway him into fighting Starro, I can totally buy that he would have just walked away from the situation in other circumstances.

Waller = US government

Flagg = patriot

I mean, it's telling how the actual criminals have more of a conscience than Peacemaker, who will do any immoral act as long as it's sold to him as being for justice and democracy, and Waller, whose job it is to protect America (while ignoring that Starro is a global threat).",oyxaam

There's no way James Gunn isn't familiar with the running joke in the Marvel comics that Squirrel Girl is unbeatable because there are just so many damn squirrels in the world.

I'm happy with Stallone big dumb King Shark being the main movie version and Ron Funches shy hacker one being the beautiful animated subversion, just as Tom Hardy's Bane is the latest 'serious' version of that character but the Harley one is a genius mix of the old cartoon brute, the scheming ambitious villain who the others don't take seriously, and just keep the ridiculous Tom Hardy voice because it's hilarious.",oyxaam
h8p27ke,With the fucking nutiness of the Aquaman movie you totally couldve had a Ronald Funches King Shark,oyxaam
h7yvpjz,It was nice to have a  dc movie that didn't have slightly odd and blurry visuals,oyxaam
h7zfq5g,Yes and no. Steve Agee (the Task Force X techie in the glasses) played live-action King Shark on set in a giant body suit/helmet. Then they composited King Shark over him.,oyxaam
h8a7wb5,"Yeah, he was very detailed but definitely cartooney and not realistic.",oyxaam
h80is3e,"I just want to know who was the guy who gave him the book. Did they do it as a joke or did they think, ""Yeah, that shark-guy can completely handle this""?",oyxaam
h8161jo,Loved that scene. But his speech pattern there was so specific I wonder still if Gunn had originally envisioned Bizarro for that role in them movie.,oyxaam
h7wh17x,Thanks. Now I am curious about that book.,oyxaam
h80ra5w,Most definitely. I actually thought for a second about Force 10 From Navaronne while I was watching them storm the fortress. Loved it.,oyxaam
h8zz8j0,Commando vibes is what I got.,oyxaam
h82btps,"Yeah, it was referenced in Batman because of it being in the comic The Dark Knight Returns. 

Was pretty cool that they brought it back for this film",oyxaam
h85ykdw,It's where she did her combat photography,oyxaam
h883wmq,I think Bane is from Santa Prisca. DC has a surprisingly large number of fictional Caribbean islands,oyxaam
h7x1br1,You are more right than you probably realize. The majority of the movie was filmed in Panama and the video game Just Cause gets its name from a USA military operation Just Cause to depose Noriega the dictator of Panama.,oyxaam
h81eamx,"Yeah, well, I know it because Vicki Vale took some pictures.",oyxaam
h7w47uo,He died a superhero,oyxaam
h7xdvlb,"Never thought we'd be having a conversation about how OP ""polka dot man's"" powers are.",oyxaam
h7wemiq,"Dude, when he used his polka dots on that set of guards, that was my only ""Oh fuck"" moment in the movie.",oyxaam
h7x71bj,"Right? I was sitting there wondering ""which of these guys actually has the firepower to kill the giant freaking monster?"". Followed by ""Definitely Polka-dot guy, it's gotta be him right?""

Killing him off after that was a great, 'oh, fuck' moment. The rat swarm being the answer took me by surprise, but in hindsight it shouldn't have. The smoothness that all the pieces clicked into place in the final act was astounding.",oyxaam
h7zmx9j,"Ratcatcher 2 killed a kaiju by extending a microphone with a light on it and thinking about it. At least polka dot man struggled with his power, so I think who is overpowered might need reconsideration",oyxaam
h7wrzhe,"Imagine ever saying ""polka dot man was op""",oyxaam
h7zujgw,I don't see how he's OP. He has a limited amount of Polka dots he can use. And if he doesn't expell them from his body at least twice a day he'll die. That's the info I got from watching the movie.,oyxaam
h83pinn,I got frustrated as hell when he started celebrating after hitting starro once.....why would he not aim for the eye,oyxaam
h8asntu,Glass Cannon. All the firepower no actual defenses,oyxaam
h87dsg6,"more op than nom, nom?",oyxaam
h7w4cu6,"Yeah that's how I read it too, but I don't remember then getting to explicit house much before he runs out. 

He did say he had to expel *some twice a day, but that was a minimum (who knows the max).",oyxaam
h7wah7b,None of these characters have a concrete backstory other than harley and Flag of course. That's probably why James chose them,oyxaam
h83rors,"His backstory and power set in the movie is completely original. In the comics, he was an inventor who created a bunch of gadgets and weapons that could compressed into small circles, which he wore as polka dots on his suit.",oyxaam
h8532kg,"Earlier in the film, we hear something about Polka Dot Man having to ""let loose"" (or some similar term) his dots specifically **twice per day.** Which led me to believe that he could only unleash the dots twice per day, but apparently that is not the case. So I genuinely do not understand why that line was in the film or what purpose it served.",oyxaam
h7we0w4,I was certain she was gonna get eaten. Glad she didn't. She was the heart of the team. Especially after what happened to Milton :(,oyxaam
h7wx8zn,"Amazing performance by her. Can't believe a character whose whole gimmick is ""I'm the weird girl in hs who talks to rats"" pulled my heartstrings. In a DCU edgy universe film of all places.",oyxaam
h7wtt4w,"He’ll also be in Dune later this year, so I think he’s gonna be showing up in more things. And honestly, good for him.",oyxaam
h7wn7j0,Yes she is.,oyxaam
h7wh9iq,"People always say that about young actresses and sometimes it does not happen, so we will see.",oyxaam
h7wtr9i,"I will be honest, I come into this post with zero context so I had thought this is a reference to Lynne Ramsay haha.",oyxaam
hab7ui9,no it doesn't lol,oyxaam
h847obp,"Not a powerful character but he was also Dwight in Gotham, a guy who was like a wannabe joker. That's where I knew him from. He did great in this movie!",oyxaam
h8ri79p,"When I first read this comment my first thought was ""The Detachable Kid had a show already?""",oyxaam
h7vyzgz,Just watching a giant Polka Dot man's mom destroying the city was both weird and oddly entertaining.,oyxaam
h7w19s6,"Also, man in hindsight it’s fucked that he sees everyone as his mother. It means he’s comfortably able to kill them, so he’s willing to kill basically anyone and everyone he sees.",oyxaam
h7vzree,"When we first see his ‘worldview’ and every member of the Squad is his mother, I thought it was oddly heartwarming that King Shark was also his mother. It means Polka-Dot Man views Nanaue as a sentient being rather than just a dumb animal.",oyxaam
h7we2m7,I lost it when he looked at the giant starfish and saw his mom,oyxaam
h7wez1t,"Did you notice that he was saying he finally was a ""mother-fucking super hero""? I was a little worried about that phrasing...",oyxaam
h7w2j2c,Talk about Oedipus Complex.,oyxaam
h7whq2q,Pretty sure there was a Milton Mom in there too.,oyxaam
h7wid3z,Made me think of the music video where they sing I want your soul. Can't think of it for the life of me.,oyxaam
h7whax0,yeah it took me awhile to see that but then you see how happy he is lol.,oyxaam
h7wi6db,It took my mind way too long to register that the all changed from their normal selves to his mother.,oyxaam
h7w2ymt,I have to say this response is not surprising given your username.,oyxaam
h8eiff8,I agree. When he took out the tower in the rebel camp it basically looked like it had the range of a confetti cannon.,oyxaam
h81dnr7,"Had a little ""S"" on it and everything.",oyxaam
h7w24zb,Nooooooooooooo damn it.,oyxaam
h7w0mpd,"Ah fuck, gonna crawl in a hole now.",oyxaam
h7x0x0n,"Sean Gunn’s cameo as Calendar Man was hilarious, especially because David Dastmalchian very recently played Calendar Man in the animated movie Batman The Long Halloween.",oyxaam
h7wp4f3,He’s also Weasel.,oyxaam
h82rx5s,"He does the MoCap and I believe the “voice?” of Weasel too, just like how he did the MoCap for Rocket in GOTG.",oyxaam
h80vgyb,And themselves,oyxaam
h80t8sf,Dean Pelton is in Civil War and Abed is in Winter Soldier as well.,oyxaam
h7xw1r7,Dammit.  Now I have to watch it again.,oyxaam
h7wncn8,"classic rat crate, good one, Dad!",oyxaam
h80i1nf,I'm glad they didn't have a drawn out fight.  Two marksmen unloading bullets at each other would have ruined the characters.,oyxaam
h812r1u,"I was fully expecting Cena to finish Elba's sentence about the rat crate and then say ""Yeah, me too."".",oyxaam
h895zyf,I liked that Peacemaker reflection moment too,oyxaam
h7zpzf7,Lol,oyxaam
h7wsdnr,"Cena is an insanely straight guy. From a comedic point of view like if you want to mold a perfect ""american ubermensch"" of some sort. No nonsense attitude, perfect body, good looking, great voice. And Cena knows that and it seems to be his brand of comedy.",oyxaam
h8c4i5e,"His dancing was fantastic as well, and then when they cut to polka dot man dancing and then cut to his perspective, so great!

Pacing of the movie was great, no scenes that feel wasted, can't think of any scene that wasn't enjoyable.",oyxaam
h7wy62s,The transition into how Harley sees the world during her escape was so well done. That woman is fucking nuts and I loved every second of it.,oyxaam
h7x10gk,"For me, they kinda did. When I first saw all three captured in the truck, I remembered that shot from the trailer and it hit me that was them escaping from it

Still an awesome scene though",oyxaam
h7wkq2o,Yup had this same thought. Then next frame showed him t-posing like all is well as the vehicle flips,oyxaam
h8f60pl,In a really cool continuity though in all the scenes afterwards he's got a big circular bruise/cuts/scrapes all around that one arm in the area where he had it in the hole.,oyxaam
h804q2q,"Damn that makes sense. She needed empathy to lead the team, but conviction to complete the mission.",oyxaam
h7wf3f1,"Hey we still very much could, with all the time travel/multiverse shenanigans that are happening in the Flash movie next year",oyxaam
h7wx74s,You couldn’t see him!,oyxaam
h7xltrj,"If there was going to be a double cross, it was going to be him, up until the night club scene I thought it was coming but at that point I started to have my doubts but when it happened I wasn’t shocked in the least. I’m just saying that if anybody on the team was going to betray them it was Peacemaker and part of the Suicide Squad’s appeal, to me at least, is that the unexpected is going to happen. In this case it didn’t so I was kind of disappointed, but I liked the Peacemaker character and his fight against Flagg was beautifully choreographed.",oyxaam
h848wp7,"You get to watch THEIR development too as they realized how fucked up this whole operation is and how far Waller is willing to go, it was great.",oyxaam
h7wu7w7,[deleted],oyxaam
h7zk0s0,He was the one injecting the bomb into Savant at the start of the movie,oyxaam

h7wb3t2,Nom baby?,oyxaam
h7wvssm,naaaa,oyxaam
h7xdsab,"Oh damn! No where to rent here (don’t think). Unless Disney buys them! We’ve been getting some films to rent like Black Widow, Cruella, etc on Disney+",oyxaam
h8lnyvy,Harley isn't in the original Suicide Squad comics. She didn't become a part of it until the New 52.,oyxaam
h7zr2v1,"No worries, if they want him back, they can have him.

In the comics, the powered Boomerangs are his very accidental attachment to the SpeedForce which has time/healing shenanigans.  The fact that it was still glowing means the door's open if it needs to be opened.",oyxaam
h7w1qn0,"I really appreciate them letting Polkadot Man make it to the very end, just to be smooshed. Gave the last fight a little more weight than everyone just walking out fine.",oyxaam
h7yrv34,Sort of disagree in the sense that I wish the deaths were more spread out. I wasn’t worried about characters dying anymore after they killed 2/3rds of the cast in the first five minutes. Sure we lost some more people in the end but we went most of the film without any casualties because there were so few left.,oyxaam
h7w61is,"While I totally saw Team 1 getting fucked up in the first 10 minutes coming, just from the line up and trailers, I didn’t think that Team 2 would be on the job right then and there. I figured they’d be the B team sent rescue Flagg and Harley.",oyxaam
h7zp8g1,"There would be riots in the street, and honestly for good reason lol.",oyxaam
h81n4ad,"Harley was definitely coming out of this alive, there's no way DC would kill off their most consistent brand even in this move.

Everybody else, including Bloodsport and Ratcatcher were fair game. Especially after Flagg and Boomerang bit it.",oyxaam
h7w410z,I just spit-laughed,oyxaam
h7w1zru,Bloodsport obviously they had a 3 hour conversation about this,oyxaam
h7w4qgj,Are you kidding me? He's been with us the whole time!!!!,oyxaam
h7w4q9i,"Harley and Flagg’s friendship was also surprisingly wholesome, him willing to risk the mission to save her and her genuinely being upset that he died. I also loved that little look they shared in the rain when the squad approached Jotenheim. As bad as the 2016 Suicide Squad was, Gunn really used the few elements that film set up well to great effect.",oyxaam
h7whwv3,Varro is his best role for sure. The story never felt like it had real stakes until his plotline sets the tone for the rest of the show.,oyxaam
h8e896a,"It is for me as well. Can't tell if recency bias, but man I haven't laughed so much throughout a movie in a long while. And the quality was up there with what I consider action classics. I was shocked (in a good way) how strong they went with the dialogue/humor and violence. It was refreshing in that it wasn't geared for kids or to sell merch.",oyxaam
h80nqyu,This is true,oyxaam
h88le4l,"I feel like the original Ayer would've been better but still not good.

The dialogue and character beats we got that didn't seem to be reshot still weren't that good.

But I guess it's one of those things we'll never know for sure.",oyxaam
h8749q7,"They don’t want good movies, they want popular movies",oyxaam
h88rf3e,"But do we know studio interference made it worse?  A lot of times reshoots do genuinely improve a movie.

I wonder if the original was grim, gritty, and had no humor.  And they reshot it to add some humor but didn't fix any of the underlying problems.",oyxaam
h7zgy59,I am curious to see David Ayer's opinion on this movie.,oyxaam
h7wp3sc,"Luckily (or unluckily) for them, Waller is the type to get some use out of people she hates first rather than immediately discarding them. I guess we'll see how rough the Peacemaker assignment is going to be on them.",oyxaam
h7yr8z7,"Well, to be fair, we didn't see the staff member that knocked her out, just 2 of the other ones.",oyxaam
h86v3pp,Doesn’t this movie have nothing to do with the other one?,oyxaam
h7wbb65,Joker too. It's the highest grossing r rated movie yet.,oyxaam
h7x2fgt,"Yeah, if anything, Deadpool 2 did the X-Factor fake-out before Suicide Squad 2. Reminded me of how Terry Crews and Bill Skarsgård were hyping up their roles in Deadpool 2, only to die immediately after being introduced.",oyxaam
h7w5yw7,Which is ironic because despite the rating for Suicide Squad 1 made more than 80% of MCU movies.,oyxaam
h7w3lvp,"Yeah, but it takes a lot different elements coming together to get that result. Sadly, I don't think in the current environment, the movie will turn a profit, but it probably would've done very well when the original one had been released.",oyxaam
h7y8iwx,"Which is part of the reason the original was further trashed in editing, I believe",oyxaam
h857pg6,its almost as if making a good movie will make you money.,oyxaam
h86mi5i,"It also demonstrates that there are certain titles/properties that will flop if you don't go all out with a hard R rating. 

You can try to make the NC-17 based material a PG-13 movie if you want, but it's going to flop and the studio will realize ""we shouldn't have neutered this"" AFTER they lose a ton of money. 

The hole idea that PG-13 brings in more money is only true with certain movies; this being one of them. 

Granted, the rating is not why the first one tanked.",oyxaam
h8g82s8,"Shit, it would've been the same year as Deadpool.  It doesn't feel like that movie and the first Suicide Squad came out the same year for some reason.",oyxaam
h7xzrfu,"Deadpool: ""We're bigger than Jesus.""",oyxaam
h7wl2z3,joker too,oyxaam
h7yrpjz,"The original SS movie made more than either, didn't it?",oyxaam
h80929k,I think The Joker is what solidified it for WB.,oyxaam
h7w7t81,That’s a really good point. God if it was a box office success that would’ve been amazing.,oyxaam
h851deq,"You'd get an R for much less than this has. I've of the opinion that the US rating system could use a PG-15 rating, though I think it'd still get an R here.",oyxaam
h7wfhjw,yeah both have some charm in their own way. i’m more familiar with aquaman and it’s entertaining but christ almighty as a movie it all over the place. explosions interrupt every other conversation. the pitbull toto cover. and the final battle has a ton of cool ideas that are absolutely wasted on the fact it’s hard to actually notice anything or keep track of because everything is happening at once. here in the suicide squad the action scenes are staged very deliberately and you can appreciate what’s going on on screen,oyxaam
h7xwnp9,Aquaman was fucking terrible lmao,oyxaam
h80n3lc,"No they are not.


This is the first DC movie since the Dark Knight trilogy that is actually good. The Joker was the only other movie that was at least interesting. The rest are all shit.",oyxaam
h7w4xpw,"I have a soft spot for Man of Steel also, probably in my top 3 for the dc movies. ww is great too ofc.",oyxaam
h7xh5sb,They didn't even let him try the fake mustache.,oyxaam
h82cu00,"I thought he was sobbing.

I was disgusted by him the whole movie after he eats that guy, but I was also like ""Where's Nanaue? Everyone else is in the club. Where is he?""",oyxaam
h80tex5,FUCK!,oyxaam
h7zszah,He is clearly crying lol,oyxaam
h7wfiok,to nom,oyxaam

h7ylqoe,I can emphasize with that,oyxaam
h84jl3e,"You could literally see a tear run down his face, it was because he was sad the fish creatures tried to eat him after they escaped the tank.",oyxaam
h7xbd3t,He cried when he landed after his friends tried to eat him.,oyxaam
h7yajl9,"You would not eat your friends, would you?",oyxaam
h84wsrm,The DCEU has already failed as a franchise,oyxaam
h7x2bc8,"I thought he was just groaning cuz he was getting shot at multiple times, lol",oyxaam
h7x711c,We,oyxaam
h7wm67a,He doesn't nom nom friends,oyxaam
h822bbd,"Oh yeah. The movie is pretty blatant about all of it being the U.S.' fault. It was nice hearing a little bit of Starro's side, though. He was innocent until they took him in and started messing with him.",oyxaam
h82dulp,"Not borderline! Full stop facts. Everyone on the stage was a victim of American hubris, including Starro. I’m glad Gunn took the time to make that crystal clear.",oyxaam
h80m5v3,And Harley,oyxaam
h836bol,Taika always kills the emotional payoff moments. The man is a treasure.,oyxaam
h86iodt,"How viscerally the eye deconstructs as the rats gnaw through the layers was an awesome touch, but that fucking song will stick with me. I had big FLCL vibes with the heavy guitar riffs coming in for the insane final battle.",oyxaam
h83jw6o,Hand?,oyxaam
h817okh,I was expecting the whole time he was shaking her whole ass arm that he was gonna chomp it off. Glad he didn't and glad she made it to the end cause she was my surprise favorite.,oyxaam
h88f62i,"“If I die because I gambled on love, then that will be a worthy death.”

I read that as foreshadowing. James Gunn got me. He’s so good.",oyxaam

2) i dont have anything with feminist or female character per se but i dont i like when they shove ton of them into my face. For example, the previous one with Harley Quinn, Bird of prey, that movie literally woman good all man bad",oyxaam

h8hsznz,Thanks,oyxaam
h8873mx,Anything less than an R would've ruined the movie,oyxaam
h7zi2zr,Nah. Not his style. Deadpool is more obnoxious wink wink cool guy comedy whereas Gunn is more immature irreverent silly comedy. Wouldn't mesh.,oyxaam
h7xe6k4,"Maybe. 

I guess I find Ryan Reynolds to be obnoxious. Gunn might be able to use that but I’d rather see him on some other project.  Let him make some crazy version of Howard the Duck or something of his own creation.",oyxaam
h8398j3,This movie reminded me of a mix of Deadpool and guardians.,oyxaam
h7y2hbw,"I mean there were songs for sure, but they didn't really take over any scenes like in GotG. I guess I didn't realize how many songs were really used in this one, but I felt there was a much larger reliance on the score of the movie compared to GotG.",oyxaam
h7w8uch,"When John Cena darted the woman washing clothes  I was like ""hold up somethings up""",oyxaam

h7wh3r0,"I think I noticed they were a different group than the military but I was not sure if they were good or bad until you see Flagg, lol.",oyxaam

h7xipev,"Honestlu think its just good for Gunn to take the reigns of a part of a universe. Maybe I'm wrong, but this is his field house. Can't really see him directing a superhero movie",oyxaam
h7w5bgf,"I doubt Guardians 3 will be the last thing he does with Marvel. Before they fired him, he was heavily involved with what the next phase of movies was going to be. He's the guy they've got behind the entire galactic side of Marvel which is supposed to become a bigger part of the movies.",oyxaam
h7xswrz,"I doubt he'd want that kind of role, at least at DC. That sort of thing burns you out and it seems just doing The Suicide Squad took a lot out of him. He's said that he plans to take a break after GOTG 3.",oyxaam

h7xtz9n,It could if he and WB could mentor other directors with a similar style. Like the Conjuring franchise.,oyxaam
h83ju9d,"MCU can give us The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy. That's a pretty flexible franchise.

h85rcj6,">  think he's much better as a comedic actor than he is in a more serious role

h856xl1,"There's also a fair number of places in the one shot sequence where you can tell the actresses aren't actually hitting the stunt guys. It's small enough in the big action sequences that you can't really tell most of the time, so it's not all bad. Looks really cool in the big scope, but then when you watch it afterwards you slowly kinda start noticing the background.

h7x33qb,"Respectfully, it's not a ""Marvel"" thing, so much as a ""good writing"" thing - *Young Justice* (DC Animated, for those unfamiliar) does a similar thing with characters like Sportsmaster, Vandal Savage, Cheshire, Black Manta, Psimon, and so on - that can be done regardless of subject matter; the fact that both were done with respect for the subject matter of the original backstories, while adding a fresh take in so many different characters (without losing the essence of the characters) is *excellent* writing.",oyxaam
h82t4kr,To be honest Gunn does the exact opposite most of the time. In both Guardians 1 & 2 and The Suicide Squad he took the characters concepts and then redefined them for his own ends. The only character he left alone was Harley as her personality was well established already and he really liked writing that character anyway.,oyxaam
h7wyu3e,"Its a good writeup. You kinda have to handle comic book characters straight and serious but always need a grain of campyness und sillyness into it to make it work.

It also helps that Gunn (like Marvel) based this movie on a ""real world"" setting. You can relate to that. You can believe a squad of criminals with superpowers, doing the dirty work for the government, especially in some ""rogue nation"".

Sadly, the other movies were so bad, the prior Suicide Squad and Harley Quinn solo movie in particular, that Starro's usage, even here, depowered, is still better than nothing.",oyxaam

One pebble on the road and she was down. Here, she was barefoot while being tortured. So, the moment she was freed, she grabbed herself a pair of combat boots. Great for fighting especially on uneven ground. And I just love the combination of this ""princess"" dress with these military boots for personal reasons. I've been known to pair up my most girly-girl skirts and dresses with my pair of men's brogue boots.  I love the contrast. It was great to see Harley do the same. It works.

But John Cena as a person is just terrible. Him delivering the news of the death of Osama Bin Laden at the hands of Navy Seals during a wrestling match is like something out of Idiocracy. 

Then him doing all these western monkey videos for the chinese where he acts like a dumbass and shills bing chilling and hot sauce. Apologizing for calling Tibet a country, all that shit. 

The man is the size of a fucking house but he's completely spineless, tasteless and lacking a moral centre imo.

Wait, you think a movie studio is going to kill off one of their most popular, iconic, and well-acted heroes (or anti-hero, I guess?)?

Of course she's invincible, the same as 95 percent of central star characters out there (especially this early in a movie series run. If she dies, it'll probably be when this phase of DC movies wraps up). Often, when a big name does die off, it's not because the studio wanted it but because the actor is done with the series/role.

So lets say the main team (Bloodsport,Harley Quinn, King Shark, Rick Flag, Ratcatcher 2, Polkadot Man, and Peacemaker) Thats 7 characters you want backstories for.

h88aqrj,"I'm just going to put my opinion into context, because I realize this will inevitably boil down to subjectivity (which is fine).

Tarantino understand just deserts (the punishment that one deserves). If a character does something terrible, the audience expect that character to get their due, unless there is reason otherwise. The ending of Once Upon is brutal, but it's perfect example of just deserts and irony. The characters getting killed are monsters in real life, they killed Sharon Tate. So, the audience doesn't feel too bad for them because we know what they actually did. (Obviously you need the context for that scene). Tarantino does this in all of his movies (Pulp Fiction, Death Proof, Inglorious Bastards, Hateful 8, etc.)

But I understand the gore effects and what's actually happening in the scene make a difference (that's scene in Once Upon is very brutal). 

To me, I had problem with the gore in Suicide Squad is it didn't feel earned. I had no clue the range of evil for these characters (no context). Captain Boomerang is literally petty thief and fan favorite character, so seeing him have a horrific death scene (that was played for odd laughs) was troubling.

h83yt0r,"Javelin has appeared like 14 times in DC comics. I myself have actually read two of those comics. It's a big fight between the JLI and the Suicide Squad, and he's in it.  


Even still, out of the 14 characters in those comics, he's easily #14 in terms of importance, and as a hardcore DC fan, I still didn't remember that he was in those issues, and when the character was introduced in the trailer, I was like ""..fucking, who?!"" The characters we follow in the movie are obviously a little higher up the food chain than that...but not that much. Damn, did I enjoy this movie.",oyxaam
h841y4l,"There was constant 30sec action shots, then 30 slow shots back to back. It's flow was not good. The first 30mins was the best part of the movie, then it's just hard brakes. I love the intro, but it was just a straight up obvious trope that 99% were going to die. Harley and the President whole thing was truly unnecessary, it was 10mins from her being pulled out of the hole, to her killing the presidente, to being detained again. And then here escaping. Her escape was badass, but she could've killed the presidente during her escape instead wasting 10mins on pointless exposition. It felt like it was just a plot device to get her into a red dress with the black and red hair.",oyxaam
h8onhwo,"Lmao like Joker is some kind of masterpiece that the “teenagers” can’t appreciate? Joker is edgy to the max, and boils down to “society bad make bad people”. Joker couldn’t be more overt in its premise or message except for maybe having Joker get a “damaged” tattoo on his head. It’s a fine movie and I definitely enjoyed it, but it severely lacks nuance and is just as egregious as most other superhero films in adding characters with recognizable names for no reason. Thomas Wayne in that movie could be any character, but it’s Wayne so people can point at the screen and say “oh I know that guy”. The suicide squad has plenty of cameos and Easter eggs that do the same, but it’s core cast of characters and their cookie cutter attributes are used as a joke - Gunn gets that comics just create the same character and change one thing to differentiate them, but then he gives them their own personality and story so you can tell them apart, to mixed effect, something a movie like Joker fails at fantastically. SS is not perfect by any means and certainly not much better than most other superhero films, but don’t pretend like Joker is somehow a top tier film and more superhero films need to go in that direction - hell Iron Man is arguably a better character piece.",oyxaam

Personally see Snyder Cut JL as the best comic book movie of all time, WW1 was very decent (2 is garbage), Shazam is bloody amazing, Joker as an interesitng and had a very decent message, personally enjoyed BOP for what it is (I love Harley to death though mind you), Man of Steel was actually great. Constantine was also really good and I can not wait for the obvious JL Dark DC are setting up. 1984 was garbage.Aquaman, even BVS imo were kind of garbage tier for me, OG JL movie is garbage.

Also as a random side note JL DARK Apokolips war is exactly what the garbage of IW and Endgame should have been, it might be an animaiton but it absolutely craps all over that garbage.

DCEU has had it's missfires but for me personally the last 4 years esepcially has been a slowly building redemption arc. Black Adam, the impending JL Dark, Shazam 2 should be continuing that trend me thinks.

h8b0ie4,"Pete had been a cast member of SNL for a bit now, and for the past couple years has been one of the more famous/popular cast members. Typically the bigger cast members are big for one of two reasons: either they are really good at acting as a wide range of different characters (recents like Bill Hader of Kate McKinnon) or they just have a lot of personality and stage charm even if every character they play is the same (recents like Adam Sandler, Andy Sandburg, and Jimmy Fallon). Pete is definitely the second. 

Pete got his big start doing self deprecating sessions on weekend update, basically making jokes about himself and his depression. At the time he was one of the youngest cast members and it really worked. Then he started dating Ariana Grande, and then they broke up with her claiming it wasn't meant to be and he had ""Big Dick Energy"". During this time he  would take breaks from being on the show either due to checking into a mental hospital or just not showing up, then when he came back he would talk about it on weekend update. This gave a connection to him, that even though he isn't as funny as other members of the cast, you feel like you know him more.

If you want to check out some of Pete's better SNL stuff, check out some of his weekend update bits or the series of ""Chad"" digital shorts (which is probably the best repetitive but they have had in the past couple years).",oyxaam

It speaks to a lot of people with depression, mental disorders and substance abuse issues to see someone clearly knowledgeable about the topic being able to joke about it in the same way we talk about it ourselves .  It doesn't come across as sanitized like a lot of SNL skits.

 I compare it to John Mulaney (who I also enjoy);   they do skits together all the time.  But while Mulaney jokes about his life and all the issues he has he still puts up a barrier about it.  Like that was all in the past and he's doing great now.

Pete Davidson acknowledges in his jokes that every day is a struggle and he is still not doing great, but he keeps trying to do better.  That means a lot to people who are in the same place.",oyxaam

""To be completely honest, I didn’t even know about the Harley movie when I was writing the screenplay. I found out about that awful late in the process. But I knew that, no matter which way you look at it, Harley has a past relationship with the Joker. So I needed her to be coming out of that in a certain way, and I needed her to make a healthy choice — healthy from her perspective — about where she’s going in her life and not being dependent on men.""

h8tc09j,"I literally cannot fathom how you think picking those examples outweighs the entire MCU where they all have weird padding and textures and pockets and stuff added.  A few examples:  


 Captain America- wrong. Wings altered to not stick up, Headpeice made into helmet vs 'cowl', random pads added everywhere. Gloves wrong. texturing of costume wrong.    


You mentioned Groot and Rocket Raccoon. Sure they included the characters, But took away Groots clothes (for some reason) and changed Rockets because what he wore in the comics wasnt ""cool"" enough.  


Doctor Strange is just an entirely different outfit. Like you can kind of see the inspiration, and the cape is similar but other than that its just different.   


Star Lord, while now the comics have been changed to match, had a different outfit in the comics before MCU. Like totally different.   


Tons of unnecessary shit added all over Thanos. Hes a pretty simple character in design and all over his torso they added weird armor and texturing stuff.   


  
With DC the only big example I can think of is Flash, and the 2 villains you mentioned",oyxaam

h882spt,No because Weasel was presumed dead,oyxaam
h8hmcd6,"No.

My reasoning: Waller knows she went over the edge and Starro would have been a threat to national security, but likely viewed her team as assets that would be wasted on a fight they couldn't possibly win, and that's the reason she recalled them. With the threat eliminated and the tape kept from the public, I don't think her commitment to national security has much room for vendetta. Remember, the reason she shot her own comms people in the first movie was their lack of security clearance. No emotions involved.

Comicbook nerd reasoning: That's actually Waller's niece.

Her thing is much more specifically about protecting America and America alone, in this context through removing any trace of America’s connection and liability. The idea was probably to just sick the Justice League on him before he started threatening the lives of Americans, but until then, she doesn’t give a fuck about how many people it fucks up in a non-allied foreign nation. 

Her whole character in this is a critique of American interventionism and such. Protecting innocent life doesn’t even factor into her equations, nevermind being any kind of priority. It’s all about protecting the American government.",oyxaam

I hate Cena’s character, especially because the actor himself has been quite a bitch to superpower governments lately, soured my mouth watching his character.",oyxaam

h84xhuu,Who were you fucking?!,oyxaam
h7ypoot,"Yeah, it's basically Scrat in a live action movie.",oyxaam
h81douh,"Wow, that's actually terrifying",oyxaam
h88cvxy,"NGL that actually would be terrifying. 

Imagine him running around at night hunting children or him sneaking into a home.

They played him off as a comic death in the movie but I'd scream if I see him at night.",oyxaam
h83jn27,I wonder how they captured him in the first place,oyxaam
h8i0oql,"every time he almost died i thought for sure it was it. When he goes down with the cute things in the blast of blood, or splatting out of the skyscraper only to get shot.

i was SO ready to be upset when the zoomed in on him being grabbed exactly like the brainiac villan, right after polka dies too. 100% expected him to be straight up ripped in half,  was really happy to see him get chucked off screen into a building",oyxaam
h7x2bir,He’s kick remy’s ass,oyxaam
h7wuxp8,"I do have to say Stallone killed it.

But still I do like the animated movie version of King Shark that just repeats ""King Shark is a Shark"" for everything. He's voiced by John DiMaggio (Bender, Jake the Dog) and that version of him just fits in a different way.

The Harley Quinn Animated Series King Shark is Ron Funches and that's so different too.

I'm rambling, but I'm glad they did my boy justice!",oyxaam

h7xzuad,Book so good.,oyxaam

h7xhr0d,Nope. They just thought he was nom nom too,oyxaam
h7wsfd8,Dude. Milton survived. Black guy? Good with guns? Put superman in the ICU for being an asshole?,oyxaam

h7y2c47,"""Oh fizzle sticks""",oyxaam
h844tlb,Or a polka dot.,oyxaam
h860nw1,"Agreed. After the animated series Harley, I’ve felt like the character design stopped matching the character. 

The Arkham games design just didn’t make sense to me. Like they had this mentally broken and abused woman and thought the best thing would be to just remove most of her clothes to make her a sex symbol.",oyxaam
h8dnb2u,You say that like they didn't cast one of the hottest women alive and constantly put her into skimpy outfits.,oyxaam

h855229,"I mean, if I were Milton, Do you wanna stay outside in the van while you're being attacked by the country's military? Or do you want to be with the american super agents trying to liberate your country? Smart man. Plus if he survives, he's a hero to his countrymen",oyxaam
h8fdxdp,"The gag was so well done.  I didn't register him at all during the superhero walk up scene in the rain, but I saw him walking into the building withe everyone right after and was like, what?  

I don't know about Gunn as a person, but he writes amazingly funny and relatable movies.  The Milton call back with Harley and Bloodsport at the end was perfect.  

As I'm writing this I'm wondering if it was an homage to Milton from Office Space?",oyxaam

In reality someone would have pointed out that Starro may not respect international borders after he's taken over Corto Maltese. Releasing Starro into the world is almost like releasing a disease. Eventually the problem would come to every country.",oyxaam
h8dnwa1,"The way I see it is that this is definitely the case and that Economos, Harcourt, and Flo as well as the rest of the staff are used to this. But you can only take so much and tolerate so much. So while at the start they were fine with betting on which Squad members would bite the best no problem. By the time the film runs its course they've had enough of Waller - and by extension America's - causing chaos and harming innocents. So that's why after Flo whacked Waller they decided to back up the Squad to stop Starro.",oyxaam
h80e8m6,Yea. The way they were keeping their heads down the entire time refusing to make eye contact seemed to imply that they were just not talking about it.,oyxaam

h7yh80j,"I wasn't necessarily surprised they killed him (Harley was my only 100% certain survivor, unless you count Amanda Waller), but I didn't expect it that soon.",oyxaam
h80loih,Captain Boomerang is perhaps the most faithful adaption to the source material. Perfectly cast and written. I cried out when he died. :(,oyxaam
h80xong,I wished he survived.  I liked Captain Boomerang,oyxaam
h83glvw,Yeah def was caught off guard by his death,oyxaam
h8167jr,"He was the best one, from the original, and the one I was disappointed about, when they killed him off. 

My wife asked what Harley Quinn's power was, and I said she has Plot Armor. And that javelin was telegraphed so obviously. It's kind of annoying how in your face they are about her.

The good part is that litteraly everyone else outshines her, since you never feel that she is in any real danger, at all. For a while I was even more invested in Milton, just because he kept hanging around.",oyxaam
h7xwm6w,"Hbo Max’s subtitles ruined his death for me.  Anytime you read a characters unfinished sentence, you know their time is up",oyxaam
h80imrw,It's the camera angle. It's a death shot.,oyxaam
h81ac6d,For me it was once I noticed how conveniently far away he was from Bloodsport in the background. It felt like his placement was perfect for a tentacle or chunk of building to hit him. I immediately felt sad knowing I’d have to say goodbye lol,oyxaam
h8bha0v,"As soon as he said that my husband said “Aw shit he’s gonna die” and right as I said “WHAT” it happened, I had no idea!",oyxaam

h889jr8,"He wasn't overpowered against Staro, and there was nothing else after that.",oyxaam
h7ymr6e,It was obvious he was about to die.  Big hero moment.  Normally stoic character very excited to have had a big hero moment.   Smish.,oyxaam
h8236du,"Guardians is considered one of the best superhero movies because it's a very tight story. Each scene in it has a tie to the overall plot and it wastes no screentime. The first pirates of the Caribbean film also has been touted to have this trait. Movies makers should try to emulate these. Granted, I liked SS but there was a little slack in some areas.

""Telegraphed"" is to convey what's going to happen before it does thru other clues.",oyxaam
h88u615,It was not.  But polka’s was.  I wasn’t talking about Flag.,oyxaam

h7zndca,I have yet to watch Super.,oyxaam
h8063ng,"Yeah I’ve always thought the lack of a “working-class hero” has been a weird blind spot in DC’s library. 

Obviously there are exceptions, but in their flagship team, the justice league, pretty much everyone is an extremely powerful meta-human or god besides Batman",oyxaam
h84ngtg,Is that show worth watching,oyxaam

h7x2ru6,"Maybe so, but for all the wrong reasons. 

It is hilarious that someone wrote that, shot that, and edited it like that. 

Worst part is the scene would be fine if it just had an element of back and forth to it. Turn it into more of a conversation with other squad members interjecting, questioning if her sword really does that or it it's just something she made up for the reputation, etc 

Instead it's just 5 wooden exposition lines delivered back to back. Its so bad.",oyxaam
h81mvn5,This is katana!!,oyxaam
h7xfdx6,That was Peacemaker.,oyxaam

h8ezzzv,"I don’t know if there’s a deleted scene, there are other actresses credited as dancers but Klementieff is uncredited. It could just be a cameo as a favour to Gunn since they have worked together before, it seems a lot of actors enjoy working with him on multiple films.",oyxaam
h8284qv,"Seems to be a lot of confusion but it was definitely Peacemaker, seems like it’s going to lead into the show and I imagine they’ll repeat the scene for those who didn’t stay till the end of the credits.",oyxaam
h7wnxyf,"Honestly they could have left out the shitty ""Suicide Squad"" side plot and focused more on Milton in general.",oyxaam

h83mmhf,Nah the rebel leader set Milton up as their driver to get them into the city,oyxaam
h857m7r,the hilarious part is that DC apparently has a ton of mercenary hitmen who are good at sharpshooting enough that they can just change the name and it'd be perfectly fine.,oyxaam
h857102,Yeah he was one of the best parts of the old movie. Wouldn't mind a rivalry in the next film,oyxaam
h864yye,Actually he had no idea who he was playing. He signed on for an unknown role and only wanted to work with Gunn. They were never trying to bring in deadshot,oyxaam

h89a2jw,At boomer's death? Teared up? Seriously?,oyxaam
h89iwm3,"I mean, he could've had the astronauts he facehugged just release him back, but he got ambitious.

h8ld5ph,That one guy died with his dick out,oyxaam
h8zedci,"Yeah I was incredibly impressed here. I liked James Gunn already, but I honestly think this is one of the best written superhero movies.",oyxaam
h88wow2,Unless the Thinker was reciting some false narrative.,oyxaam
h80qkvt,"Or the fact that they pulled a “Galactus defeated by Squirrel Girl” by reminding us just how terrifying “controlling every rat in a metropolitan area” could actually be.

By the end of the movie I was convinced “hmm, maybe Ratcatcher is the strongest member and it’s not even close”",oyxaam
h8558s5,Starro is a recurring Justice League villain in the comics and presumably a lot more powerful than what we saw in SS.  If they used him in a Superman or League movie they would definitely ramp up his power level.,oyxaam

h80c9er,"When Starro broke out, I was certain the Justice League was going to have to appear.",oyxaam

h80daeq,"It would it it was a comic book but just like marvel, at best yoy will get some references or a cheap actor from the big actor's movie. This kill the whole shared universe idea in the movies for me.

Scarlett witch is fucking an entire city with magic and The sorcerer Supreme doesn't appear, hell he doesn't even sent one of his guys to check it out, instead we got ant man fbi agent and suddenly a PhD astrophysicist / hackerman lady from Thor 1 and 2 who was studying like social studies or something.

Yeah... That's not what I thought when you said shared universe.",oyxaam
h9l28b5,Starro was in Zack Snyder's Justice League as a grey transforming thing,oyxaam
h823eia,"The Synder cut did use ""Starro"" as this weird techno-organic mind reader device.  It was as much Starro as his Jimmy Olsen was Jimmy Olsen.",oyxaam
h849avz,Starro seems way too easy for the Justice League. Any of them could obliterate it.,oyxaam
h80we3n,"Well, to Starro's credit, it did take a magic javelin to pierce its eye. A whole platoon of soldiers unloaded on it and didn't so much as make that giant eye blink. I imagine Superman would also have to take time to wrestle with the moral conundrum of ""How do I save all the people Starro's enslaved?"", which the Suicide Squad really didn't give a shit about.",oyxaam
h80sc45,"True, presumably if Starro was a Superman or Justice League villain it would probably be a lot more powerful like in the comics.",oyxaam
h83b0wg,"Well the threat of Starro is usually that the starfish drones attach to some of the heroes coming to stop it and you're mostly fighting off your own friends while trying to work out how take down the big slow damage-sponge primary body, and also not getting starfished yourself.
Somehow in this they made use of none of that and just had it be a big monster, not even one of the 'expendable' main characters gets possessed?",oyxaam
h7yktqp,Make it a giant spider and now we're talking!,oyxaam
h80o8fp,"Loki was the villain in the first Avengers movie, and he was the first villain the Avengers ever fought in the comics. Obviously Starro's very different from Loki, but I always felt it would make sense if a Justice League movie used their first villain as well.",oyxaam
h81kmic,At least it wasn't a giant butthole.,oyxaam
h81hb6d,"I honestly think a  live-action Justice League New Frontier (40s-50s period piece) type of movie could totally work with Starro as the Villain. 

 To bad that seems very unlikely now that suicide squad used him first.",oyxaam
h81bmp1,"Starro is ridiculous on the page, but there’s a version of it that’s very much ripe for a “serious” portrayal in film.

I’ve always found this [iconic Justice League cover](https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/justice-league-of-america-190-0.jpg) frightening as a kid. It wouldn’t take much to make that concept a legitimate worldwide threat. 

Mix in some of Romero, Lovecraft, and Giger influences, you have a horrifying villain unlike anything we’ve seen in superhero films.",oyxaam
h80dgwe,I'd they could get their head out of their ass there should have been a cameo here by superman who comes to save the day on the 11th hour because a bunch of C listers beating Starro is kinda pushing it,oyxaam
h84upbn,I don't know man before Man of Steel they wanted him to fight a giant spider and in Man of Steel he fought a giant robot spider/terraforming machine so I don't put any thing stupid beyond WB execs.,oyxaam
h802rg6,Any comic book would be a trash universe to live in. Just absurd and violent and bizarre. Colorful surreal characters that drop one liners before killing or maiming people and alien starfish controlling your mind.,oyxaam
h81uhwz,"> Audiences are desensitized and don't realize how horrifying some of this shit would be irl

A great summup for the superhero genre, The Boys and Invicible are fun wake up calls",oyxaam
h83c7wl,"Isn't that the premise of Starro in the comics anyway though? Giant brightly coloured space starfish, people find it and just go 'what the hell is this?' but by then it's too late and a swarm of mini ones have enslaved all their friends, the goofy and unthreatening appearance has lured you in.",oyxaam

h80mysw,Just carrying us on to the next level of desensitization.,oyxaam
h83pg11,"Yeah, that part and the end where it said it was happy just floating and looking at the stars.  Very likely Gunn took inspiration from the original King Kong for his version of Starros.  It wasn't a monster until humans took it out of it's environment and did what they did.",oyxaam

While I admire what the MCU is able to do, I sometimes wish they weren't so caught up on ""canon"".  Hopefully the multiverse give them an excuse to start doing similarly.  Whether shows like *Agents of SHIELD* or *Daredevil* were canon or not, I'd love to have another Marvel based show that wasn't so tied to the ongoing storyline and was just able to do its own thing.",oyxaam

He actually did the only significant damage we'd seen up to that point. Bloodsport got Starro's attention, but Polka got an actual scream from Starro's mob. And from what we could tell looking through Polka's altered view of the world, he actually cut a significant portion off Starro's right foot. If his power held up, he might have been able to cut Starro in half (which would have been a terrible idea if Starro is anything like starfish haha).",oyxaam
h7xtv41,"Yeah, Ratcatcher is the least person I'm expected to be my favorite character in the entire movie.",oyxaam

Typical US",oyxaam

Again, comic-books. 

Logic means nothing to the creativity of the comic-book writer. Anyone could come up with some bullshit to how he survived.

- new robot heart
- cryostasis
- part of his soul was conveniently trapped in a friend's sword.
- etc

You can make anything work.

Flaggs death was meaningful, especially (I assume) for the upcoming peacemaker show. But not so meaningful that you couldn't bring him back.",oyxaam

h83sxrs,I know right?! They spend like 3 hours talking about that.,oyxaam
h7yw0js,"I feel like that could be said for everyone else though. 

Bloodsport overcame his fear of rats and became someone his daughter could be proud of.

Ratcatcher found a new father figure as well as family that she felt she belonged to.

Even King Shark found friends that he didn’t want to eat, and who accepted him.

Harley kinda just stayed consistent with her Birds of Prey development.

But yeah, they all could’ve died because their arcs were done and there wasn’t much to tell. They could’ve all made it out, as the new family they made in Corte Maltese, but he just suddenly died. Still really awesome that he got a complete arc.",oyxaam

h816tq1,"I don't think US Agent was as much of an ""Evil Cap"" as Peacemaker is. The only times John Walker did something truly horrible is when he lost it and went rogue. He's more ""Cap gone mad"" rather than an Evil Cap imo. On the other hand, not once did it seem like Peacemaker was acting like he had lost his mind. He was fully aware of his actions despite how horrible those actions were. The character of Christopher Smith is a genuinely awful human being which makes him a much more potent Evil Cap (maybe he'll grow a soul in the spinoff series but rn he's worse than Walker in my eyes)",oyxaam
h7xzmxb,"For real, the shock in his eyes realizing he went too far in killing a man like Flag whom he respected. I notice when Ratcatcher 2 is begging for Peacemaker not to kill her, he's holding back tears. Damn man. :'(",oyxaam

h7zfbh1,He's so much better than Anthony Mackie at playing an Asian man.,oyxaam
h8cmibg,I loved his take on RoboCop even if the overall movie wasn't great.,oyxaam
h8fnszc,I thought it was Flag too.,oyxaam
h7w2uba,Also the plan to save Flagg wasn’t to save him but to kill the soldiers fighting for democracy.,oyxaam
h7w8stc,I’m just salty Boomerang died. I liked his character from the last one and I thought he was solid enough to last through this one. I suppose he was noticeably absent in a lot of the promo stuff.,oyxaam
h7zrcpl,Also if you recall Harley and Flagg were sent with the first team probably meant to sacrifice them all. When Flag found the freedom fighters Waller found more use for him and got rid of the freedom fighters that would cause stability in the country. Pretty much mirrors real world politics in central America. US only cares for countries that provide what it wants and causes instability in those that don't.,oyxaam
h7x6dtn,"Why is Flagg still working for Waller?

Genuine question. Flagg's a respected war hero and obviously not a criminal, so what's Waller got on him?

I thought maybe he's just working for Waller because he thinks the missions are important, but if Waller has it out for him, why is he still leading the Squad?",oyxaam
h80blln,I think Harley was there because Waller knew about her reputation with the people and with the president. If she wanted Harley dead she could just kill her. Flagg is a different story though.,oyxaam
h83gdr3,Great points I hadn’t considered. Guess the office worker who assaulted her with a putter is done for in suicide squad 3,oyxaam
h7w5cke,But this isn't a sequel..Right?,oyxaam

h833a57,uhh you do know this movie wasnt a sequel right... lol,oyxaam
h85bvyf,Wait is this a continuation of last suicide squad? when did he miss obey her?,oyxaam
h8d3oy5,"Also enchantress is gone, so Waller doesn’t have the leverage over him of keeping his girlfriend strapped to a bed til she needs to use her.",oyxaam
h8g0g2h,"I'm still not even entirely convinced this movie exists in the same continuity as the ""last one""",oyxaam
h7w18il,Makes sense considering Flaggs reaction to finding out the US was behind starro all along.,oyxaam
h7w3b45,"I think she just didn’t care


She needed a team leader prop and Rick has experience and then Harley is just loud which I think was the whole point of team A",oyxaam
h7w16jm,"well, Quinn is a recidivist",oyxaam
h7w3ldv,She literally sidetracked the mission to save Flagg.,oyxaam
h7w5ryf,I think she meant it when she said they were tough and would survive. And the plan was to have Weasel alive. Who knows how many he could have taken out.,oyxaam
h7wodp8,"Maybe Flagg, but Harley is purposely handed to the general by Balckguard, imo.",oyxaam
h7wcqvh,"To her, they’re all expendable pieces.

…and it is the DC Universe.  She probably has a lot more superpowered Z listers in Belle Reve.",oyxaam

h80ih22,Yea this seems more likely,oyxaam
h83olv7,That or she didnt want Flag teaming up with the freedom fighters and getting in the way of her mission to erase America's involvement.,oyxaam
h7w37dp,"I don’t think she knew but her selection was basically picking the loudest people possible, like that first team was so over the top and then the real team was all people with relevant skills to the mission


Harley and Flagg surviving was just a bonus",oyxaam
h81tezb,Given how stupid Blackguard was it wouldn’t surprise me if Waller knew what he was trying to pull,oyxaam
h7w2s6l,"Because he survived and was then valuable, she expected that team to get wiped",oyxaam
h9l3m0e,"I was more surprised cause he had clearly gained weight since his skinny days, but he's clearly worked hard and dropped the extra weight now. So good for him!",oyxaam
h93h35u,"Considering Mongul beat Superman's ass before in the comics, I think that's a pretty scary thought for the Justice League. Quite a horrible move on Waller's part to use someone who can beat Superman's daughter as fodder lol",oyxaam
h7y8nk1,With any luck we'll eventually see them on a DC TV / HBO Max show because at least there talented people have been able to develop DC properties without having to deal with Warner movie suits or worrying about box office receipts.,oyxaam
h9l3bof,"Superman and Lois is already on the way to breaking that trend, so I won't be surprised if we do see the more out-there villains",oyxaam
h88k4j4,I think that's when they said critical condition iirc,oyxaam
h7wbm9t,"Right?!

Flag and Harley being there threw me off because I was like ""Okay cool, failed mission, then we get the real team!""

And then Boomerang died and I was like ""Wait...""

People fuckin gettin offed in ridiculously quick fashion, and Flag being ""sacrificed"" was not what I was expecting from the start of the movie and I fuckin loved it.",oyxaam
h7w7y3j,I thought that too! The fact that it was a diversion was an excellent way to showcase the “Suicide” part of the squad.,oyxaam

Wasn't expecting the two teams to be sent out at the same time though.",oyxaam

h8a3lrc,"I see it as the antithesis of the first Suicide Squad film by Ayers. There you have long-winded introductions to the team. Then you have Slipknot show up and just by the way he is introduced you know he is just disposable. The movie basically tells you not to care, meaning the fact that he gets his head blown off has absolutely no impact.

In this case you get a full introduction and then everything goes south. It is a lot more brutal than I expected, but at the very least it has actual impact and combined with the operations team betting on the lives of the people in the field, it very much sets the tone for the film.",oyxaam
h7xvni7,"Name (almost) checks out (What's a ""bumner""?).

The whole point is that the Task Force X ""heroes"" are disposable. We *are* supposed to enjoy seeing the real, horrifying consequences of untrained ""super"" people in pajamas fighting actual soldiers with guns. It's taking the piss out of the whole idea of superheros through the power of dark comedy.

You couldn't have more totally misunderstood what this movie was supposed to be (and was). Like, even though I would like to see David Ayer's cut of the first movie, based on what made it to the screen, there's almost no chance that it will be as good as this. Because the irreverent tone and gallows humor is exactly what the Suicide Squad is about as a story concept.",oyxaam

in conversation earlier. Only a pro hears someone's weakness and plans for it.",oyxaam
h85gvkv,"Maybe that was the point. Pacemaker claimed he was the better marksman because he was also always on target (like Bloodsport) but also used smaller bullets (making it harder to hit targets). That last scene showed us that was false/a lie- Bloodsport ended up being the better marksman that pulled trick shots with the smaller bullets, while Pacemaker relied on huge hollow points.",oyxaam

hab6zi8,"loodport had a much bigger weapon payload and was more about efficiency and gear managemant. he had big gun mods for destroying shit, but a small bullet and a big bullet kills people the same of you hit them in a fatal shot, so his regular use bellets were smaller, just like his hand guns.",oyxaam
h85rsqk,"The basic premise behind the ban is that wounds caused by hollow point bullets are harder to treat, and in a wartime scenario, you'd ideally only have to worry about standard bullets hitting more enemy combatants (bearing in mind that the ban was drafted during the 1800's when the scope of war was a bit different than what it is today).

Interestingly (in the US at least), this is why hollow-point bullets *aren't* banned and are able to be used by law enforcement (so not in a wartime scenario, i.e. not a war crime). A police officer can shoot one target without having to worry about who or what might be behind them, and in a domestic environment, it would be easier to rush someone to a hospital to treat the more severe wound, unlike soldiers who have to hope they reach a medic or a field hospital to perform on the spot triage.",oyxaam

If it wasn't for Covid they would have had a big hole in their schedule; I can't believe they would have gone through all that bullshit just to avoid rehiring Gunn a few months earlier. 

I think they legit axed Gunn and he promptly jumped ship to DC, only for Disney to realize it was a bad move at about the same time and they needed him back. Too slow.",oyxaam

h81d6yy,Imagine Will Smith returning for the next movie and Deadsport looking at Waller and be like… “are you seriously doing the same again?”,oyxaam

h7wfgfj,">The problem with making the villains too likeable is it leads to a lot of disappointment when the hero wins.

Someone else mentioned creative freedom, and I agree, that's essential, but given DC's villain roster, I think they could pull it off.

The main problem is, if they do goofy/witty heroes, they get accused of copying Marvel. If they do totally serious movies, they get accused of being too grimdark.

Ultimately, Marvel got there first, so if DC wants a cinematic universe, they're walking a fine line, regardless of the tone they choose.",oyxaam

He shouldn't be in the driver seat, but I would still really like it if he had a seat at the table and was able to say ""And then for this action sequence what if we put the camera over here and had the characters do this and then this"", because he's a very controversial director but I don't think anyone can argue that he's a great cinematographer.",oyxaam

The main DC hero movies have been grimdark heroes vs. grimdark villains.

Make the villains the likable, quippy ones, but ultimately doing bad things, while the heroes just show up to beat their faces.",oyxaam

It was so fucking refreshing to see a comic book movie that not only put a ton of work into the action choreography/stunts, but also had a third act that DOESN'T devolve into a mind-numbing CGI shitfest that runs too long. It was just so beautifully simple in a way that has become so rare with blockbusters.",oyxaam

h87119d,"Technically it’s a standalone sequel, so I think it’s meant to have very little connection to its predecessor so that audiences can still enjoy it without having seen the first film. But I think that doesn’t erase the events of the first film entirely. The fact that Flag, Boomer and Harley acknowledge each other and express a small level of camaraderie in the beginning shows that they have history together (aka their adventures from 2016 Suicide Squad). 

If this sequel didn’t have anything to do with the first film, I don’t know why Waller would specifically assign them to the squad that’s meant to be sacrificed. Flag is clearly a skilled soldier and in most cases, a Yes Man to Waller’s orders, so she wouldn’t have had a reason to sacrifice her top Task Force X leader. Harley is a deadly force of nature all on her own who would easily rank in a higher squad. Honestly Captain Boomerang is really the only one who would seemingly be tossed in with the rest of Squad B, but the fact that he was joined by Flag and Harley gave me the impression that Waller’s choices were intentional and revenge-driven. If we hadn’t already seen them disobey Waller’s orders in the first film, then I think she would have put them on Bloodsport’s squad to see their potential. Instead, she already branded them as liabilities, hence their placement on Squad B. And I’m sure if the others from the OG squad were still around (Killer Croc, Deadshot, Katana), they probably would have been thrown right in there with them for their betrayal.

And even the scene with Waller saying “you know the drill” when injecting Savant’s brain detonator is a callback from the first film, implying that this Suicide Squad recruitment process has become the norm that criminals of Belle Reve are well familiar with.",oyxaam

As bad as those movies were, I'm grateful they exist purely for the fact that WB seems to have finally learned the fucking lesson that comic book movies need to be, above all else, *FUN*, and ""Dark & Gritty (TM)"" is only one, extremely limited way to deliver that. It works for Batman because he's inherently a dark and gritty character, but it ruins almost all of DC's other superheroes.

I guess the fact that they chose to go inside Flagg's body for his final minute to show him totally dying, and then didn't do that for Peacemaker, shows that they are treating Peacmaker's death with less finality than Flagg's. Although they could bring Flagg back if they want to.

Mapping it would work better for stationary shots, but gives you less control over the camera movement. They'd have to already have the CG camera movements in mind to the exact position in order to get the mapping right, otherwise the perspective ""desyncs"".

Having the shot play as just an actual background element, kinda like how rear projection works, except in this case it's behind the cg camera, it allows you to have any camera movement you want, without too much to worry about.

h83amq0,"I think our view of on the violence was multiplied by the Bloodsport/Peacemaker feud. We were already getting really frustrated with the characters, and so the scene where they tore through the camp sparked no joy at all. A similar scene without the measuring contest element doesn't stick out as much. We felt that the carnage with the opening beach landing made for a good scene. I'm watching the second half as I type this, and Harley's breakout didn't seem excessive (and I'm pretty sure has a higher body count).

Looking back, the swearing isn't as packed as I thought. If I had to rewrite my previous post with more time to cool off, I don't think it would deserve a bullet point either.

I'm chocking up my comments on both the violence and the swearing up to feelings being rawer and the frustration with Bloodsport vs. Peacemaker.

> This criticism feels like you watched some of the non-R-rated capeshit and don't like this new direction.

Maybe not. I avoid Will Ferrell comedies in a vacuum, so if I get a better vibe in advance of a character that's a Ferrell-character-level blockhead, I may take a pass. Or at least brace myself better for their whole deal. This is nothing against Ferrell himself, it's just that the characters he tends to play just aren't for me.

If I had to rewrite my list, I think the only things I'd keep would be the Bloodsport / Peacemaker feuding and the subplot with Bloodsport's daughter. Frustration with those elements kind of overshadowed the rest of the movie the first time about and made everything seem worse. Watching it again (and just checking out during the Bloodsport versus Peacemaker stuff), I'm enjoying it more.

Her first appearance in the animated series she is very acrobatic as is part of the whole circus character in her earliest iterations.

There's literally a whole episode where Harley uses her intelligence and skills to capture Batman and Joker gets mad at her because he wanted to be the one to do it.",oyxaam
h87jbt4,"Yes. To an extent. ""Same level"" is a bit of a stretch, Batman is more skillful at the end of the day but that doesn't mean he wins every single time. Harley is capable of getting the upper hand on him depending on circumstances, and she's capable enough that in the Injustice plotline she's Batman's *second in command* in the resistance, so not only is she capable but Batman recognizes that she is. 

Did you forget that the whole DC universe is make believe? Anything can be anyone so long as the writers make it so. Harley being as capable as she is is no less believable than literally every other character in the universe. No one can actually shoot as accurately as Deadshot, no one can actually jump around like Catwoman, no one can actually fly like Superman. There is a baseline understanding made between the author and the reader that the fantastical is possible, and the only real justification the authors need is a pretty simple explanation. Why can Catwoman jump around like she does? Oh well she has a history of robbing places growing up on the streets. How does Iron Man make his suit? Well he's rich and smart. Why can Harley do what she can do? Well she was an exeptional acrobat and earned a PhD. Writers often then take these simple ideas to explain away the fantastical and expand upon them to give them more depth, and this is where characters in these universes tend to differ from just the small time B-listers and below, while the truly great ones find their stride and popularity. What's the point in making specifically Harley exempt from this rule where everyone else is allowed that pass?

And man, if you have this much disdain for the characters why even watch the movie or interact with its fans... is that not like less fun than literally anything else you could be doing. Also boiling down Harley to simply ""Joker's squeeze"" is such a brutal misunderstanding and disservice of how her character has evolved over the years, and does paint a pretty clear picture that you actually have no idea who she is as a character beyond that. Harley is Harley, not an extension of Joker. Their stories are intertwined but they are still separate characters (and I do find it funny that a *huge* part of her character arc is disassociating herself from the Joker yet here you are totally missing the irony).",oyxaam

Me personally no I wouldnt. I think the joke is funny or its not. Arguably this gag from Eurotrip is pretty funny. Jon Cena being in tighty whities is kind of funny. Harley Quinn running around half naked isnt even played up for laughs at all (except for when she is first getting dressed), it is just a costume choice.

It seems ppl are sheep, they see these scores so they think,"" it must be true, i must be rly good, i must rly off, maybe i should rate it high too so i dont get flack.. hmm...""

I didnt say the jokes can be objectively criticized, they rly cant, they didnt land for me but thats a minor issue among other areas with this movie, if ppl werent praising this universaly i would be ok with it, but ppl seem to be lowering their standards way too much when it comes to entertainment, either im from a diferent generation that is no longer atached to this one, or ppl rly like bad movies.

Nobody that knows a thing or two about movies tells me that this is a rly good movie, or even close to the greats of comic book movies, i reserv that space for movies like Blade, spider man 2, batman begins, watchmen, xmen 2, days of the future past, GOTG 2, winter soldier, man of steel ( this is one is the greatest example of ppl not seeing what an actual good movie is and calling it a bad movie because of how superman is represented on it, as a movie it craps all over a movie like TSS) these are all movies that are objectively better than the crap they been putting out like TSS, and yes, objectively, on all the areas i mentioned, you know, the areas that compose an actual movie.",oyxaam

h855j0s,"Yeah, I kind of feel that way about Machine Gun Kelly, especially now that he’s dating Megan Fox. So I can understand.

But I think Pete Davidson‘s main problem is that he *looks* like a douche, not that he actually is one. When I see him in interviews he seems like a pretty likeable guy. Very humble and fully admits he gets more public attention than he deserves judged off his actual accomplishments.",oyxaam
h81gpml,"Yeah, I think it’s poor planning on Waller that she didn’t put King Shark in group B. I think he could’ve ranked all those soldiers and more of the group would have survived. Now unless it was her plan to just have them die, then never mind lol.",oyxaam
h80vuql,True I think it’s one of those that’s left open for audience to interrupt,oyxaam
h8rz9eq,"Finally DC kinda realized what type of movies they have to make. They are good at it, the characters are good for it... no reason to try and copy the family friendly all happy Marvel formula when they can just do... well, this.  
  
They subverted tropes in a way that is actually GOOD, unlike some recent movies, where ""subverting expectations"" was just an excuse for garbage writing.  
  
I was surprised how fresh and fun this movie was.",oyxaam

h8hp6h6,"The behind the scenes stuff I heard was that WB let Ayer make his cut, then let the company that made the cool movie trailer reshoot some stuff and make their own cut because they liked the trailer more than what Ayer shot. WB showed both cuts to test audiences, but they hated both. So WB just mashed the cuts together and released it.

So idk maybe Ayer’s cut was ok but didn’t work with the test audience or maybe it was actually just as bad as the released movie. We’ll probably never know",oyxaam

I did try to justify it by going ""Oh, maybe this is just a field camp or a black ops site or something"".",oyxaam
h88ur7d,"Yeah, all good.  

Only reason I even made initial post was because the comment ""for some reason"" was made... and I'm a dork that had already thought way too much about this exact topic when studying the film for my friend's stupid podcast - lol",oyxaam

h8drywj,"I'm not going to lie, I didn't include the DC shows when thinking about this. Doom Patrol is great and very much embraces it comic book nature.",oyxaam
h8dxzzp,"There are dozens of us, *dozens*!

Doom Patrol is awesome but I understand the average comic book movie watcher wouldn't like it.

There's no action, none of those huge messy action pieces most of these movies tend to have. They also have some of the most bottom drawer, weird characters and villains they could find. And its awesome what they do with them.

It's weird, can get really dark and emotional. Most of the ""heroes"" are pathetic depressed losers, or just nuts or actually terrible people (when they titled it Doom Patrol they meant it).

So the result is a thankfully very different take on superheros and it's hilarious and fun but probably will never be as popular as the more popular superhero show/movie. I'm not sure how this show ever got green light but I'm thankful we get such a different take on a subject I'm mostly tired off.

I feel The Suicide Squad shares a bit of the weirdness and irreverence for superheroes Doom Patrol has but mostly sticks to a lighter fun tone which I also enjoyed a lot.",oyxaam
h8u02sa,"Well, sure, you are right if we just ignore any of the evidence to on contrary.

Everything you have said involves textures and things that literally cannot be copied from comics. Flat colors aren't a 3 dimensional thing. 

Like, you complain about the Doctor Strange Outfit, but don't talk about the highly textured Superman one that also is lacking the red briefs. Hell, look at the differences in Aquaman.

Then we talk about the practical amortization of Captain America, without talking about the exact same thing done to Batman.

You are living in a glass house and throwing stones. 

There is a reason that Aquapac. Like this movie, and that's mostly coming down to using these really cool DC properties in a fun and bright way, rather than DCs traditional somber attitude witb high saturation but dark color palette that Snyder often uses. 

You can stop trying to defend something that people like.",oyxaam

h8lcimb,"They said for a year it was an origins story. It wasn't til after the movie came out that they said it might also take place post-movie.

And they actually didn't explicitly say it'll have anything to do with movie yet. Everyone's just assuming now because he's alive.",oyxaam
h87hpe3,Yeah I had to rewatch the scene multiple times to confirm it was Peacemaker that survived and not Flag. The heart scene/line made no sense to me.,oyxaam
h893qpr,"But it’s a two second six figure shot that really doesn’t serve the story.  I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of Chekhov's gun. It’s a thing in theater where if they show something it will have a significance later on. I’m simplifying this but like if you see a movie and they make a point to show your dead dad’s harpoon gun he always took you fishing with you can be sure someone is gonna get shot with that motherfucker later on. You see it in moves all the time. So when they go that extra mile to show something like a cgi heart scene you think there has to be a payoff later on. One of the other posters said it could have just been to show he really was dead or just a fake out. Or it could be in a movie like this they’re locking down the story in the edit, had a million things going on, maybe he would have lived in earlier drafts, and just made use of a cool piece of cgi they already paid for. >!They pulled Peacemaker out of the rubble so no death is ever locked down.!<",oyxaam

h8fivtb,"Yes. Bad guy, absolutely loved every second he was on the screen.",oyxaam
h85s95g,"I don't know if win is the correct term. He literally failed his mission. Sure, the Suicide Squad didn't air the US government's dirty laundry, but they still have it, and it could go out to the public at any time.

Even killing might be a personal L for him considering he was reluctant to kill him before their fight.",oyxaam
h85a6yv,"Even when he was going to kill rat catcher he seemed genuinely remorseful about it. “I’m sorry kid”. But she would have for sure jeopardized his mission so it makes sense for the character.

This was legitimately John Cenas best acting role and I’m excited to watch the series even if I hate the character.",oyxaam
h853uhf,I disagree I liked that they kept him a terrible person. The team was recruited because they were villains. And Peacemaker specifically was chosen to have an additional mission because of his dedication to his warped idea of peace. If he had a last-minute change of heart it would go against everything his character was.,oyxaam
h8640w1,Not Deadshot.,oyxaam
h85yoto,"Thank you! She gave up and basically surrendered, and he was gonna kill her anyway just to have no witnesses.",oyxaam
ha22bs1,"She was probably concerned about news coverage, like there was at the end. Even if the international community assumed the team were escaped convicts acting independently, the US would still face severe repercussions for allowing them to escape and trigger the whole debacle.",oyxaam
h88l6k0,I agree but I also just really enjoy Margo Robbie as Harley Quinn.,oyxaam
h8idrg2,"I think they actually did a good job this time though. They took the criticism to heart about Harley. It was a good point that she’s just a basket case with a baseball bat in suicide squad with guys that range from marksmen to skilled fighters (I guess boomerang skills count) and a literal mutant. She was mostly shittily used. In birds of prey they never bothered fleshing out the actual violence she was capable of, just that she liked and had access to guns.

This movie starts out with her unleashing a RPG in the beginning of the film, and then continues with the javelin (much more deadly than a baseball bat) and the “Harley-time” John wick mindset she went into.
I’d argue that this character in this movie did the best job of showing instead of telling. She was an acrobat and a PhD, she has body control and intelligence in the bag, but the first suicide squad spent nearly the entire time she was on screen speaking and exposition dumping how she was just an extension of the joker and nothing more.",oyxaam
h98tseo,"To be fair that's an issue with a lot of characters in Injustice by virtue of it being a fighting game, that doesn't make her Squirrel Girl or anything.",oyxaam
h99bgdo,[deleted],oyxaam
h99kfy5,"I'm sure that's why they didn't do it too. It's the biggest issue with making a ""cinematic universe"" in that you have to sacrifice elements of a single movie for the wider plans. I was actually surprised they let Gunn kill Boomerang, Flagg and The Thinker.",oyxaam
h8o8utu,Both movies didn't do gurney right. Honestly I love Stewart but he isn't quite a Gurney either. I think it would take a not-so-well known actor to assume the role.,oyxaam

h88uh4e,"The variant I was hoping for was a “bag of tricks” guy, like a low-end Green Lantern or the Robe of Useful Items from D&D. Like he would throw dots at the hero and the dots would pop out, or turn into, objects and weapons. Another thing I recall him doing is using them as Portals, as in the game Portal. Which are really just variations on the same power, ie set up a chainsaw to fall into dot #4FA0 (I like to think he uses HTML color references) and when he wants it, pull that dot off his suit and activate it.",oyxaam

h88i3ai,"I think thats either the schtick James was going for or how I view it more-so is thats how Waller wants them to be, she doesnt want an independent group of free thinkers who could possibly sabotage her plans. 

She needs lackeys under government contract who’ll go along for the ride because their paycheques and benefits are worth it and clearly as the bearded guy shows they question her actions when he asks Waller if she would really do that to Bloodshots daughter with her replying being an even more grim one, yet they dont have the backbone or ability to do anything about it.

I was afraid that he'd get *cruel* with the audience for his jokes.. Like in Super when he kills off a character and it just *holds* on them for way too long. That struck me as Gunn thinking it was funny to make the audience uncomfortable. It made me fucking hate Gunn till this movie.",oyxaam

My first experience of him was the Batman Beyond episode which also introduced me to the Justice League. The plot went that there was a death in the Justice League and Bruce Wayne suspected there was a traitor. SPOILERS: It turned out to be Superman, who was under the influence of Starro. He then went on to control the entire Justice League except for the newest member: the teenage Terry McGinnis who donned the cowl of Batman after Bruce's retirement. He had to fight the entire Justice  League and Starro.",oyxaam

And something like Dr Strange showing up just because he can do magic, but he's not Wanda's baby sitter. And that's even assuming it appeared on his radar.

And it makes it more interesting and fleshed out anyway. Wandavision would have been terrible if it was just 'and then Strange shows up and tells her to knock it off'. Instead we got an interesting and fleshed out story *because* he didn't show up.",oyxaam

Let Ta-Nehisi Coates make a black Superman and Henry Cavill make a sequel to Man of Steel and anything else people want to do. See what works, what audiences like, what bombs, and in like 2028 or 2030 you can do a big Crisis on Infinite Earths movie if you want to slap the successful stuff together into one big DCEU.

But that's not what happened though, or at least I'd need a rewatch to find out. He broke out when the facility was damaged (though I'm forgetting what caused it now).

Starro would've clearly saw their conflict when talking with the Thinker, since that's when he started communicating.

And I'm pretty sure an intelligent lifeform would be able to tell the difference between the men with weapons and non-hostile others watching from miles away. Especially since he ultimately let the Squad go, before telling them he's taking the city. He's already recognizing the Squad as a non-threat to him and nobody else was engaging.

It's not Starro's fault that he was experimented on, but he had a choice in committing genocide or not. He chose rage, which is what adds those shades to his character. He's not infallible, nor is he completely at fault for the situation he was put in.

I feel like pee Maker and US Agent represents America at dif times in war. Namely, that Peacemaker is the hubris of pre-9/11 USA. The wars and conflicts we were engaged in all basically were ""World Police"" style missions. Protect our interests (goal number 1) while also looking to assist countries in getting rid of despots and replace them with US-friendly leaders that must remain under the thumb of the USA in order to get aid. 

Still heavily involved with fighting the spread of communism as well as jumping into conflicts that seem on the surface altruistic, (I'm thinking first Desert Storm here), but are actually more insidious in looking to tighten the grip of the US as the ONLY superpower and by extension using military might to keep the peace.

h8dn24j,"> Too bad Snyder f*cked the mainline franchise too much.

I think DC/Warner are the ones who fucked it up when they asked Christopher Nolan to write the equivalent of The Dark Knight for Superman and asked him which director would be better to film this dark gritty rendition, and then hired Snyder to do exactly that.

I'd say all things considered, I'm happy it was Snyder that was chosen for the job, because he made it interesting visually. Take Snyder out, and you still have a dark gritty grounded Man of Steel with the exact same script minus Zod's death, but less cinematic and impressive visually. The only thing that would change is what happened after, but even then Snyder has said that once he *simply* pitched the idea of having Batman has the villain of Man of Steel II, the studio wouldn't let him back away from it. 

And I'm not saying that because I'm asking anyone to like those movies, if it were just for me I would have done something entirely different with that franchise, but my point is that I seriously doubt the result would have been better with another director. They choose someone exactly to do what they had in mind. You don't get hired to paint a wall red, and then go: ""Well, it would be better to build a bridge instead"" you'll just get replaced, because they don't want a bridge, they want their wall to be red. As I said, replace Snyder, you still have DC/Warner hiring a director to make a dark gritty grounded Man of Steel with the same exact script. And if you were hired to do that, that's because that's what the studio wants. So if you work on a sequel, you plan it with that mindset in mind.",oyxaam
h840d8o,"Yep. I really wonder if WB and DC are continue just deciding which films are ""canon"" or not canon or if they are gonna restart the whole mainline universe for the franchise.

It had terrible pacing issues, the ‘bird of prey’ were completely redundant and added nothing, the fights were all style no substance and very poorly done in the 3rd act, and large swathes of it were just dull and/or trying to hard to be mega quirky.

Outsmarting batman is OK since she is a PhD psychiatrist and she knows about manipulation.

And as for her earlier iterations, she was created for batman the animated series and in those series she is classed as an above average fighting and agility person since she was an Olympic level acrobat.

That background in no way shape or form means she can go toe to toe with batman. Joker shouldn't be able to go toe to toe aswell, his thing is all about abusing batman's moral compass to achieve his ends.

She never went toe to toe with batman in the animated series, only in the latest movie they made in that universe series, they (as is tradition with times) made her somehow be able to tank hits from nightwing, land some of her own and slip laughing gas at him to capture him. So as per usual she fights people she shouldn't be able to and nightwing gets hit ass kicked in yet another movie.

The first villain Presidente General Silvio Luna was played by an Argentinean actor but I'd say that's compensated by the second villain who was played by a Mexican.

My point is that this fact doesn't tell us how powerful the dots are.... because rats can also cut through starro.  The javelin did too.  Maybe enough bullets (like a few miniguns) would also cut through starro.

We see machine gun fire bounce off the king.  Maybe the bullets don't bounce off starro, but are simply too small to be a bother.",oyxaam
h8704hx,"Did you bother to read what I wrote before typing ""wrong""?

>Bullets don't seem to hurt starro or the king. Maybe the bullets were just too small. Recall that rats can easily chew through starro.

If you were to see, from a far distance, someone shooting a machine gun at the empire state building, you might think it was doing no damage.  Maybe it's a matter of scale, and enough bullets would hurt starro.

Are rat bites more powerful than bullets?  Rats can't chew through bullet proof glass.",oyxaam

Starro asked them to save him, then Thinker told him that they're actually here to kill Starro. Then Polka-dot accidentally triggered the bomb and damaged the building, which led to Starro breaking out and being assaulted by the leaders of the country. 

What was he supposed to do? He has yet to find anyone who doesn't want to hurt him the moment they have power over him, and if he actually sat down and refused to hurt anyone, someone would either kill him or start torturing him again. He absolutely made the best decision available to him.",oyxaam

They just wanted different things for the character.

Him defending Johansson in her lawsuit makes it clear that he told them not to pull this shit and he was the one to delay Black Widow by over a year so it can have a theatrical release, when everyone was pressuring him to just release on D+.

Worked great for this movie and that trait being the main difference between him and more grounded Bloodsport or principled Flag, as otherwise they're all 3 otherwise identical 'big guy with guns', like the way they all do the same takedown on the guys in the truck.

The stereotype for the Marvel formula is a quippy funny hero, with a forgettable one-note villain. My suggestion is just reversing that, so the hero is serious, but the villain is fun and relatable. 

DC comic heroes frequently get labeled as unrelatable paragons, so I'm suggesting using that to their advantage by capitalizing on the villains like they did here.",oyxaam

Not only that, but we don't really know what Harley's involvement was. In most versions of the story, the Joker beats Jason to near death with a crowbar, and then uses a bomb to finish the job...but is usually shown acting alone.

The Volume isnt even really a new idea in principle, it's just still just classic rear projection.

Then a few years ago, various teams independently from each other kinda all started experimenting with ""virtual productions"" sets, where they would still just use a flat background to display the content on, but it's when they started making stylized and photorealistic backgrounds digitally that started to change things.

It was still incredibly computationally expensive to get the desires results in real time, so lots of different techniques were tried.

Then RTX tech came along and sped everything up REAL fast, even in non RTX fields (because people came up with new ways of optimizing). Then Unreal Engine was gaining popularity for smaller real time production sets.... And then Disney came along and freaking accelerated the progress by what feels like a decade with their full 360° coverage tech! Still blows my mind, I can't wait to see where this stuff goes!

Deadshot being leader of the B team would be such a natural evolution of the character as well from the first movie, Flagg recommending him for the position would make sense given the respect he had for Deadshot by the end of the first movie.


This, along with the fact Idris Elba was origionally announced as a re-cast for Deadshot, makes me fully believe the film was originally developed with the character of Deadshot and only underwent minimal change when it was changed to Bloodsport.

For the record, I have experience in Argentina itself since I've lived there for a while, and some of the specific details do quite match with it, since aside from the Nazis reference and the president, you got Milton's keychain being Mafalda, who is basically to Argentina what el Chavo is to Mexico, and Peacemaker (or one of them, I don't remember correctly) asking for Fernet, a very popular alcoholic drink there (although, not asking for Coke with it was a bit weird). Also, the dialect you can hear in Spanish matches with the argentinian vocabulary, using words like Che (hey) or boludo (dude/dumbass/whatever really), but it's also used on some of its neighbouring countries, like Paraguay and Uruguay.

Yes, because plenty of good movies have really cringey shit that we let slide because it's genuinely sincere/the rest is so good we get over it. I am definitely a lot more interested in his version than the one where a company that makes trailers chop something up entirely different than what was originally filmed. 

>And he made then act like people on school plays, that's the sign of a weak director.

Do you not know how much reshooting was done afterwards by the production company? You do realize we didn't see HIS version, right? So you have literally no idea wtf we could've got. 

The thing about David Ayer, is that he actually grew up in a life that these characters lived. He's one of the lucky ones that live through that shit and end up in a better place. That's exactly the type of guy I'm interested in seeing portray the characters of Suicide Squad, rather than another privileged gen xer doing edgy comedy akin to Deadpool/South Park. And I say this after watching this movie and having a blast, because James Gunn is still talented. And I say this knowing Ayer's version was clearly just as edgy, but I'd take genuine edge over a suburban portrayal of it.",oyxaam

h83512s,"Clark Kent the mild-mannered reporter however is an integral part of Superman. The day he just walks away from his problems is the day he's become to distant from the people he cherishes. The pretense is an act of humility so that he can live a normal life as a common man, better appreciate the struggles of the average person, and of course act as a journalist to fight the battles the sheer might of Superman cannot win.

If you've ever read Mark Waid and Alex Ross' Kingdom Come, there's a lovely moment in the climax of the book where Clark accepts a gift of glasses from Diana, once again embracing his identity as the mild-mannered man, as many of the issues he faced in the story came about after he quite literally flew away from his problems for decades.

Grant Morrison touches on this nicely in his novel 'Supergods', also noting that the reason Superman would chose to surround himself by the normal humans of the Daily Planet is because he admires their character and tenacity, and despite having the powers of a god, he looks up to them.

To put it another way, there was a line from years back where Clark tells Lois, ""Superman is what I can do, but Clark Kent is who I am.""",oyxaam

I can get that. I do definitely think there's the risk of oversaturation, especially for the big heroes they would obviously gravitate towards. There's already quotes out there from WB people about having multiple Batmen and Supermen going ahead.

But personally I do think you can have multiple versions running around without beating a dead horse, especially if you focus on making them distinct. If you want to have 8 different iterations of the Justice League that's a bit much. But if Zack Snyder wants to come back and make a broody, serious sequel to his Justice League and somebody else wants to come along and make a bright, optimistic Justice League: New Frontier, it can work. If you've got four different Clark Kents who are all basically Clark Kent, it'll be a mess. But if Michael B.

>He has yet to find anyone who doesn't want to hurt

Yet, again, he knows there were fine humans as he seeks help from the Squad and even lets them go when moving on to the city. I think you're underestimating Starro's intelligence.

He knew what it was doing, it simply chose violence as an outlet.

>and if he actually sat don't and refused to hurt anyone, someone would either kill him or start torturing him again.

I highly doubt that.

Starro was in secret for decades, but *on the news*, the general public would realistically never stop wondering what happened to such a huge being and the obvious public appeasement would be to send it back to space, something that, now that his existence is known, he can bargain for.

Yes, they could send in Superman to take care of it, but even then, you'd have those same people asking why not send it back? You think the Justice League wouldn't disagree with locking it back up, if they were called to fight it?

>He absolutely made the best decision available to him.

He could've dwelled in the ocean, or even used the already attached soldiers to speak to a news outlet or *literally anybody* and tell them what was going on, and that he is his own independent being with his own wants and needs just like everybody else, and would like to return to space.

Taking the city over was revenge, and it's what ultimately led to his downfall. It's understandable why he felt that rage, but Starro didn't *need* to obliterate the city, he chose to. It's an intentionally tragic set of circumstances.",oyxaam

She expects the team to die while making them think she's supporting them.  It's only because they win gives them a pass publicly the story has enough deniability, and she knows letting them walk further adds distance they'll all be back in prison within the year.

>Chose violence

Starro has spent its entire existence either floating in space or being tortured. It doesn't have other options.

>On the news

How does Starro know what the news is? What the general public is? How Americans, Russians, Canadians, Irish, or Scottish people think? Or that they might want to help him return?

>Bargain

Starro has been hurt and raped by Thinker or floating in space. I'm not Sure it even knows what bargaining is.

Again, I don't think we get any evidence that Starro knows this is even an option. It's gone from space to captivity with The Thinker - you know, does he 12 angry rats in his asshole, the answer may surprise you guy?

>I highly doubt that.

>Starro was in secret for decades, but on the news, the general public would realistically never stop wondering what happened to such a huge being

Is this a joke? Not only is it way too big to send into space easily, but it's a huge gross alien who openly mind-controlled a bunch of people. Governments currently bomb children and give arms to paramilitary groups that rape and slaughter civilians without ever facing any big consequences. Why do you possibly think they couldn't spin killing what looks like a huge monster? One person saying ""it was recharging to kill more people"" on the news would be enough to convince most people. 

Starro knew nothing about any humans except that even the ones directly opposed to the people torturing him also want to hurt him. Why would he think going on TV would help?

 I can understand you having these rosy beliefs regarding people, but expecting the creature who spent 99% of his time interacting with humans by being tortured in a basement to place his hopes in convincing humans to be nice to him? No, you get a bunch of hostages and show your power, then you go on TV and demand to be left alone. That's the logical choice.

Everything about that scene tells us that if he isn't being sent for his unique skills, then what it he going for. Peacemaker was her inside man, just like Flagg was before.",oyxaam

Right, but that’s not what we were talking about. You said there was never supposed to be a distraction squad. That was wrong. Simple as that.

To comment on this new argument you’re bringing up, about Rick Flag - yes it is a little weird that she sends Flag along with the disposable squad and then sends the good squad to rescue him - but if you think about that mission and how she has asked them to exterminate everyone they see “with great prejudice” - and how likely it would be for his captures to “freak out” and kill him on the spot… maybe she wanted Flag dead anyway, especially considering he would ultimately interfere with the real mission of cleaning up dirt, due to his high morals… maybe that mission wasn’t about rescuing flag but about getting rid of the rebels who were gonna leak the drive in a heartbeat.

Edit regarding your edit;

I absolutely agree. Maybe we shouldn’t consider deleted scenes as canon but I think cutting that scene was a good idea because it creates somewhat of a deeper discussion rather than “oh he said something funny about her shirt let’s kill him.” which would have been funny but shallow.",oyxaam

They hit it dead on in this movie when he gets called out. Their is this feeling to Peacemaker that he kills in the name of peace because it let's him get away with it.
