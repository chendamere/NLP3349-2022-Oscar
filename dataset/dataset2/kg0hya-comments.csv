ggcoxui,Chadwick's performance is unforgettable. Viola is good too but Chadwick steals the show.,kg0hya
ggfddz0,"I know Chadwick Boseman's undeniably superb performance will get the most interest due his tragic passing but holy hell, Viola Davis is really one of the beat actresses of all time. The physicality she brings to the role was something only a masterclass actor could pull off. The performances are truly great but the film itself was just okay. What works as a stage play doesn't necessarily translate to film. The film needed a better screenwriter who could adapt the play for the screen. It's still worth watching just for the performances though.",kg0hya
ggd3gad,"Levee was an ambitious man who told people he was in complete control but really had no say or control other than what he says. When he didn't get what he wanted at the end he displaced all those negative feelings on to someone else, with terrible results. I feel for the guy and have met guys like that growing up.",kg0hya
gge59g6,"There’s nothing I can say about Viola or Chadwick that hasn’t already been said. So instead, I’ll say this: this year Colman Domingo has easily cemented himself as one of my favorites in Hollywood, to the point where I’ll see something without knowing anything about it simply because Colman is in it.",kg0hya
gge2jwo,"Somewhat random and unrelated, but last year, Netflix released a documentary mini series following Kevin Hart and the fallout from his anti-LGBTQ comments and subsequent bowing out from hosting the Oscars.

One episode covered Hart's production company, wherein he pitched to Chadwick Boseman his idea for a movie. I can't recall the details, but I do remember Hart making a big deal out of it and figuring it was a ""sure thing"" that Boseman would star in his bullshit movie.

During the pitch meeting, Boseman turned Hart down, basically saying he's careful about the roles he chooses and the impact they may have. At the time, I didn't think much about his reasoning for declining the part. Knowing now that he was battling terminal cancer when he met with Hart however, puts that segment from the episode into an entirely new light.

Boseman didn't want to be remembered for quick payday roles in stupid lowest common denominator comedies, like Hart. His decision to play Levee in *Ma Rainey's Black Bottom* makes so much sense now, as this will be one of the roles for which he will be forever remembered. Deservedly so.",kg0hya
gh2o9xv,"So, what are y'all thinking about the end where Levee kills Toledo? I was interpreting it as the yellow shoes being symbolic of his optimism for the future and his come up, and Toledo's clodhoppers are Black folks' past, stepping all over and messing up his dreams.",kg0hya
ggc5970,Something about Chadwick Boseman's final role involving him talking about his ambitions and how bright his future is going to be just feels like one more punch to the gut.,kg0hya
gggq4hd,"I didn't find the narrative particularly interesting but the performances are absolutely outstanding. It makes sense, I suppose, being based on a play that it's very much a performance heavy film.

I kind of felt that the ending (with Toledo's death) came out of nowhere but I understand the point that the film/play is trying to make. Despite all his talk, Levee is deeply traumatized by what happened to his parents and to him and he is walking around with all this rage and anger trying to turn it into something. He tries at first to channel it into his music and he is talented but he's stymied by the opportunities he can get (also I totally assumed that Mr. Irvin was stealing his songs to give them to another band - I was shocked he even offered to pay for them at the end. After all, why take the songs if you aren't planning to use them?). Some of Levee's problems are of his own making, of course, he's obnoxious, he's rude and he's combative and that certainly doesn't help you get any further in life and he throws away a good opportunity with Ma Rainey's band because he doesn't want to just follow the rules. Anyway in the end, I thought at first that he would stab Mr. Irvin because of Chekov's knife and all but instead he turns that violence onto an innocent person, someone who is just as oppressed as he is, someone who has shown him nothing but kindness for the most part - in part, because he knows from his father's experience, that he could never kill a white man and get away with it (not that Irvin deserved to die for stealing someone's music). It's a very heavy ending. 

I find that this era of American plays tend to deal heavily with the casualties of the American Dream. You're sold a bill of goods but they'll never come through for you and you spend your whole life chasing a phantom. I think those messages are still relevant, if not more so now, than they were when they were written.",kg0hya
ggd4zei,"Boseman delivered a knockout in his last role. People might say that he gets the oscar because of his passing, but i truly believe he is earning it with this (and also the fact that the year seems weaker in general for awards)",kg0hya
ggrntpi,I just want to say that I don't think he really stepped on his shoes.... He couldn't fight the person who had really stepped on him...,kg0hya
ghbp4wo,"I'm surprised to find comments that the movie was slow or boring. Throughout the movie I was smitten by the amazing performances as well as the colorful personalities and perspectives of the characters. Their conversations and storytelling really laid it all out for us - each band member's life, beliefs, worries, traumas. One hour into the movie I was feeling for everyone in the band, even for the ambitious and erratic Levee. But it was really Ma Rainey who tied it all together at the end.

I could not help think ""God, Ma Rainey is being really difficult."" She came to the studio late, brought her stuttering nephew to take even more time recording, and threatened multiple times she won't record until everything is done her way.  I mean, I thought I knew why -- the music industry was brutal, especially for black musicians whose talents were appropriated shamelessly. As Ma Rainey puts it, they only want her voice.  But for me the real chills came with the scene where those white musicians were playing the song that Sturdyvant swindled from Levee for mere $5. Then Ma Rainey sitting in the backseat of her car looked straight back at the viewers, like she's saying ""see? I told you so."" That's gotta be my favorite scene, it was so poignant and heartbreaking. I watched the film last night but I'm still thinking about it.

What I'm still curious about is, what purpose do the characters Dussie Mae and Sylvester play? What does the writer (of the play & film) want to say through those two? Still haven't figured that out.",kg0hya
ggc5tsr,"Get Chadwick his Oscar NOW! Goddamnit that scene of him questioning God when we know that he was battling terminal cancer just crushed me. It’s a tragedy that he’s gone, but his last film is his best work ever. Wow.",kg0hya
ggbvu4e,"A one, a. two, a you know what to do....",kg0hya
ggdxsj5,"So, I had the great pleasure of working on this film, and finally got to watch the end result.

Story wise, I think this works better as a live theater experience. However, I had the great pleasure of sitting in on a few meetings with the director and thinking back to him explaining his vision, I think he did a masterful job in pulling out the performances he got from Boseman and Davis. They are unbelievable.

Overall, a great story and very beautifully executed. Very proud to have been a part of this production in my capacity. I can only imagine how incredible this must be performed live.",kg0hya

gge6klm,"I enjoyed learning about [August Wilson's cycle of ten plays](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Wilson#The_Pittsburgh_Cycle), each based on the African American experience in a different decade of the 20th century. This film is the one from the 20s, of course. It's the only one set in a location other than the playwright's native Pittsburgh.

The other play from this cycle that's been made into a movie is Fences, which I'm curious about now. Denzel Washington supposedly has plans to produce more.",kg0hya
ggggskg,This movie feels like it was supposed to be longer.,kg0hya
ggym7bn,"I thoroughly enjoyed this and am slightly appalled by some of the critiques I’ve seen

While it has largely been received well by critics and audiences alike, the negative reviews have condemned it as far too boring which I can’t agree with at all

The dialogue may have given the impression of rambling at times, more specially when the band members are interacting with each other, but each word uttered is reflective of the characters and their respective mindsets

Chadwick and Davis were exceptional of course, and I don’t see how one could view his performance with anything other than admiration and applause

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, perhaps more than I should? Maybe it comes down to me being seventeen and lacking a desire for further nuance in some aspects of the film but this was a great film with dynamic characters that highlighted aspects of Black film that aren’t frequently covered. Levee rejecting god is incredibly impactful because he’s a Black man and his reasons for doing so are unique at least based on the other films I’ve seen that try to highlight historical issues within the Black community. 

Some were also complaining about Ma’s personality and saying that she was too cruel or egotistical when she directly states why she treats the people around her like she does. The treatment of Black people in the music industry is still horrendous to this day, and you can see her message of them not caring about anything other than the money that comes with her voice and music become more blatant towards the end with Levee being told initially that he could record his songs then being told that they weren’t good enough only for them to be played by a White band (only further reflecting the ways in which Black inventions and art have been stolen).

Overall I really enjoyed this film, it’s an 8/10 for me undoubtedly. I actually would’ve liked it to be longer if anything.",kg0hya
gi6zb9r,"God DAMN Viola was captivating in this! Completely became Ma Rainey. And Boseman! God it was sad seeing him act his ass off in his last role ever :,(
I thought the superficial “green screen” look to everything kinda hindered the film but man were those performances amazing.",kg0hya

ggbwa8v,"The adaptation from stage to screen was not all that successful to me. That being said, Viola Davis was amazing. There was a physicality to her performance that transcended those stage limitations. The way she walked with her hip out, all plastered in makeup and sweat—commanding stuff. She was big when she needed to be, but other times sage-like or seductive. Really well-rounded performance.",kg0hya
gh1dmou,"Contrary to many of the other comments, I felt it translated from stage to screen well.  The story is set in a recording studio, so finding ways to translate chunks of dialog to other settings would have been less realistic.  Viola Davis was so believable as Rainey and confident enough in her acting to look all sweaty and such.  The rest of the cast was great, too.

I saw a local production of Wilson’s Jitney a couple years ago and I hope Washington/Netflix do it soon.  It has a similar rhythm to the dialog and interplay between the characters",kg0hya

ghktcag,"Anyone interested in music, film, and Chadwick Boseman should watch ""Get On Up"" about the life story of James Brown.  Chadwick Boseman was phenomenal in that as he was in ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"" but ""Get on Up"" is a movie while MRBB is essentially a play that is filmed.",kg0hya

ghgspt0,Viola Davis deserves all the awards for this. Chadwick does too. all of it would have fallen apart if the script wasn't as strong as the performances.,kg0hya
ghjobty,"Rare for a film to me hit me so hard emotionally. Maybe it's because its Chadwick's last film? I'm not sure but hot damn, everyone here deserves Oscars. The cast works together in a perfect synergy, working off of a phenomenally written script. The music, set design and characters will resonate with me for years. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is the perfect example of when everything goes right in a film's production. Boseman gives us one last final performance and holy hell, it's a career best for him. He's a scene stealer and arguably the main character/heart of the story. I love this film more than anyone can even imagine. It made me want to buy a trumpet and learn to play.",kg0hya
gi5j7mw,"Went into this blind, not knowing the source material and only knowing that Viola Davis and Chadwick Boseman were in this and found this riveting from start to finish.",kg0hya
ggg84rr,"I really enjoyed this movie and the making of documentary that came with it. I want to know what you guys think the brick wall at the end of the movie symbolizes? I think it symbolizes Levee’s career aspirations. Throughout the movie we see him try to open the locked door to escape the rehearsal and when he does during the climax of the movie, it’s a brick wall showing he has nowhere to go. 

The director says that it represents the American Dream but I don’t really see it. 

Did you see something different?",kg0hya
gkfc790,"The title and trailer for this movie are pretty misleading. I expected (hoped) it was going to be about Ma Rainey performing around the country, singing the blues and confronting racists. Instead Ma Rainey is not even the main character. ""Here is a movie named Ma Rainey's Black Bottom that is not about Ma Rainey (and really isn't much about the song either.) I may have missed some of the symbolism but I have no idea what was supposed to be going on with things like the locked door. Is it simply ""What is that door? Why is it locked? Oh look now I kicked down the door, >! oops there is nothing behind it for me? Time to stab my bandmate.!<"" And the ending >!(not the stabbing but the white guy essentially ripping off the songs)!< was pretty predictable. Also this is a movie that came off as if they just filmed a play. 

In defense of the movie I usually take things pretty literally so the problem may be with me and not the movie.",kg0hya

go2uf20,"I watched some excellent films during Black History Month (One Night in Miami, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, Judas and the Black Messiah). All of them explore a lot more interesting and multi-layered themes than the Smallaxe series (with its very familiar focuses and didactic style) which is receiving a lot more attention.

Like everyone already said, Viola Davis is terrific. Chadwick Boseman's incredible performance poignantly hit me, especially during the scenes where he asked where God was out there. Damn... This one is going to stick with me.",kg0hya
gv4v42f,"I think you could tell that the film was originally a play - I think this is probably the weak point of the film, but other than that, it was brilliant. That ending threw me. 

The performances were all masterful - that dead look in Ma's eyes in the car at the end, Levee's feigned confidence, and the band holding the whole thing together. 

Really powerful film, and really sad that Chadwick Boseman died so young, with so much left to offer.",kg0hya
ggc4m79,"This was so good. I was blown away by the monologue about his family. I also saw another post about the scene where he’s yelling to God about letting terrible things happen all while he was battling terminal cancer.

ggcehmv,"I went in wondering if all the hype around Boseman was just because he died.

ggvphn5,"Went into the film cold (and having never seen the stage production), and it was...okay.

The biggest problem is the film for me was that it felt more akin to a proshot of a stage production (which sort of makes sense given the film is based on a stage play) than an actual film.

Dialogue and story beats just blazed through at a rapid pace, and I felt like it was hard for me to really feel the emotional moments because things kept zooming back and forth and didn't give me time to process.

The 1st act dragged more than I expected, and I felt like it took a bit too long to ""get into the groove"" and hook me into the story.

As for the acting, Davis is surefire to get a nomination. From her first moment on screen, she was Ma Rainey. Her work here was extraordinary. Hell, I think she stole the picture from Boseman. I'm assuming Netflix will push her for Best Actress, but honestly with the amount of screentime she had (which was way less than I expected - and less than the marketing made it seem), I think Supporting Actress wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility either.

Boseman's acting was overall fine. I don't know if it was an audio issue or a directorial choice, but for a significant portion of the film's first act, it felt like he was screaming his lines while his co-stars were speaking in a more normal level. It took me out of the film a lot because it just felt so out of place. Thankfully, it seemed like Boseman got his groove near the end of the first act and things went well from there.

Honestly, do I think he deserves a nomination for Best Actor? I don't know. Overall, I think his performance leaned more toward a typical theatre style rather than a cinematic one. It was good, but I don't think it was great. His pacing felt frantic (almost manic) and I felt like he didn't slow down enough for me to really *feel* for him. His monologue about his parents was stellar though.

I'd rate the film a **7.5/10**.",kg0hya
ggc4xwc,"Individual scenes? Great. Performances? Superb. Commentary? On-point and, unfortunately, still relevant. But I don't know what people are seeing in this to make it ""the film of the year"". Maybe I'm missing something. The narrative arc felt flat and disjointed to me. Conflicts would go left without resolution, scenes abruptly cut to later for no reason without resolving the thread started earlier. We never even see them finish recording ""Black Bottom"" after the mean white dude sabotages the good take, it just cuts to another scene. Maybe that's the point of it but it left me feeling bored at the start of many new scenes until those could grab my attention in their own right. There wasn't much momentum to this film. Really the recording story just served as a loose framework to support the monologues. I realize this is based on a play based on a real person's life but I think the movie could have hit the same thematic notes in a more compelling way with a story that takes place over the course of a tour rather than a single day's recording session.

What I did enjoy was the apt depiction of the exploitative blues recording industry of the early 20th century. The music business has never been friendly to artists but I don't think anybody has had it worse than these early black artists. I knew where Levee's songs were going to end up as soon as the studio owner started delivering the bad news. Viola Davis did an incredible job of channeling Ma Rainey's righteous indignation as a black woman who deserves far more than she gets and knows it well, and the strength that woman must have to stand up for herself in a white man's society.

In the end I certainly enjoyed it, but I wish I could call it anything more than just ""good"". Maybe I'll read some more discussion and change my mind.",kg0hya
ggjfsly,"If Viola isnt nominated for an Oscar, its because she was robbed.  Chadwick's final performance was also very good and shows what a tragedy his loss will be to this art form.

ggfypa3,Best Actor for Chadwick.  Like god damn.  Such a powerful performance and possibly his best,kg0hya

I know everybody has been ranting and raving over Anthony Hopkins for his role in The Father, and how it's probably the best performance of his career.

ggmzco0,"I’ve gotta say that this film really, really blew me away. Watched it with the whole family and Boseman’s first monologue struck us silent. It’s very rare for me to be wholly captured by one character speaking for a long time - not that I have a short attention span or anything but the evocativeness Boseman brought in that scene; the way in which my throat tensed with emotion, I wanted to cry but I also couldn’t because I was just so focused, I couldn’t take my eyes off of him. 

I knew he was good but my god, this was beyond. 

Not to mention the fact that the rest of the cast was stellar. Viola as Ma Rainey drew me in entirely; what a character! Her sass, straight up ‘no shit’ attitude, walk’n’talk and everything - I don’t know how much of her character was true but to be a black woman like that, acting like she didn’t give a fuck in THAT time? 

A whole motherfucking G.

Chadwick's performance as a smooth-talking, ambitious, talented but ultimately traumatized musician is a bittersweet sendoff. Viola Davis is again showing us how she's one of the best actresses of this generation - Ma didn't take shit from anybody but Viola found a way to make me like her. 

One thing I don't think people give enough credit to was the rest of the cast. I cared about each and every member of the band, and loved the way they acted with one another. Toledo genuinely became my favourite character, which [spoiler] made his death hurt all the more. Even Irvin and Sturdyvant played their roles to a T. 

But you can clearly tell that this film was a play. The unity of time and place means this film would be perfect if it was on stage. The performances from the actors were near perfect in my eyes, but I feel the medium lets it down - just because the script was clearly written for the stage.",kg0hya

Chadwick is fantastic and the entire time, I couldn't help but think about what a career he would have had over the next 20-30 years.

The film took a while to get going, but once it does it's really quite powerful. Similarly, it took me a bit to get used to Chadwick Boseman's performance (it's so manic and flashy), but after his first big monologue I was fucking IN. Speechless at the end of that, I said aloud to my wife ""Holy shit, that was incredible."" Honestly the acting all around is very impressive, including of course Viola Davis and the entire supporting cast of musicians.

I do think the ending (in the basement room) came out of nowhere. I can definitely see that working better on stage than in a film, because honestly I was just left with more questions than...

We can tell the script’s most poignant moments come from the stage play, whose beautifully written dialogues remain mostly intact.

h1o644g,"To me the movie was extremely dull.
Yes the acting was superb, not gonna deny that.
I also liked the camera work, that was really good. 

But

Nothing happened! The story can be told completely in 4-5 sentences. The dialogues were unrealistic and seemed to jump from one topic to another. Maybe I’m too unfamiliar with the way black people talk but there were many times where I didn’t get what they were talking about.
The characters seemed to be either over the top or lacking substance / personality. Except for Levee none of them had an arc.

Maybe the movie is more interesting if the viewer is invested in blues, racism or religion but if not and especially for non-Americans there is not much else.

I didn’t know Ma Rainey was a real person until the pictures at the end and as an Asian atheist living in Europe, none of the themes of the movie stuck with me. I know some folks are all about the god-crisis-monologue by Levee. But to an Atheist his bursts weren’t shocking at all and therefore lacked the punch.
I’m still in awe how that many people especially in the us are still religious after countless evidence pointing to the contrary and after everything science taught us - but that’s another topic.",kg0hya

h03ju7v,"We got around to watching this last night, not know anything about the plot or subject matter. I’ll admit that between the title and opening scene, I was misled into expecting a biopic about Ma Rainey, making it harder to connect with the early scenes at the recording studio. 

But once I caught on, the film became phenomenal. The acting was exemplary, and the story, while partially predictable, was moving. 

I’m saddened by those whose expectations require more visual action, but all I can suggest is learning to appreciate the visual of body language and facial expression.  Too many people suggest it’s like the filming of a stage play, but the camera motion and positioning belies that. It’s so obviously different from something like the Disney+ version of Hamilton, which really was (mostly) video of an actual performance.",kg0hya

ggdw1bu,"I'm not a theatre man—in fact I've only ever seen one show with my class and I can't even remember what it was—but to me this is a prime example of how not respecting the capabilities - shortcomings as well as strengths - of each medium can get you the worst of both worlds. All this amounts to is a bunch of soliloquies about the evils of the white man and the plights of the African American, which, fair enough, but also, just plain insufficient on its own. The end result is a 94-minute long woe-is-me look-at-how-bad-it-used-to-be jeremiad. Those kinds of sweeping statements and grand gestures may make sense up on the stage, but they feel incredibly didactic, very unimaginative, and ultimately hollow on the screen. (Don't even get me started on that weakly motivated violence... Jesus I wanted to rip my hair out at that point, even if I had mostly enjoyed the film before that.) But most people obviously don't share this sentiment.

What a waste of some great performances. It brings me no joy whatsoever to not be fully on board with this, because as everyone else has been saying, Boseman is nothing short of stellar in here...",kg0hya
ggtpmvp,"Considering he was suffering from colon cancer and in immense pain while shooting, and yet still gives such an intense and amazing performance just shows what a loss to the acting community he really was. Viola mentioned that in between takes he was obviously in poor health and drained, but the second the camera turned he just completely turned on and gave it his all. I'm sure a lot of the emotion in his big emotional monologues may not have even been acting, as it kind of parallels some of what he was going through at the time. 

He will certainly sweep the awards like Ledger did for Dark Knight, I don't know if they will campaign for best actor or supporting, and I haven't finished the film yet, but it wont just be a sympathy Oscar. I was never really into Black Panther and this is actually the first role of his I've seen (unless I'm forgetting something), but he's a FORCE OF NATURE in this.

With that said, so far I like Viola's character more and find her more interesting and think she is equally deserves to sweep the awards. I think they both own the film, and sometimes their towering performances is like a battle between which actor can steal the scene and its electrifying. 

 But I'm still rooting for Aubrey Plaza in Black Bear, and both of the actresses in Saint Maud.",kg0hya

This is an over generalisation, but the message is that black people (e.g., Levee) have gotten screwed over by white people (Sturdyvant). Instead of seeking retribution from the culprit, they take it out on each other, and sometimes over chicken sh*t like scuffing up someone's shoes.

gh9gf5b,"Agreed. My favorite scenes were the ones with the musicians just shooting the shit. Dialogue was super unique, acting was fantastic, and some fascinating topics are discussed.

And I think Ma's character development was very well done. At first she just seems egotistical (and she definitely is), but as the movie goes on she gains remarkable depth.

The film was staged like a dialed-in regional theatre version of the script that lazily follows stage conventions of actors needing to find their light to deliver the biggest lines and sound cues to warn us we’re strapping in for a lengthy, weighty monologue.

The whole cast was perfect and carried the movie, without them it would've fallen apart since it was adapted too close to the play since the pacing and dialogue screamed stage play. It could have been adapted better to fit into the medium of a motion picture but the cast saved it from falling flat and feeling awkward because they were all a joy to watch.",kg0hya
gkbjyvy,As a stage actor and a passionate theater consumer I’ve never seen this on stage but I could just imagine how impactful and intimate this would be on stage. The performances were incredible but the format didn’t lend itself to film-style.,kg0hya
gvmmmp4,It reminded me a little of Glengarry Glen Ross in the sense that you have this group of guys who take turns doing monologues.  I didn't know it was a play going in but you could tell it was based on a play as soon as the action moved to the studio.,kg0hya
gggpok8,"I haven't seen the documentary yet and still processing the symbolisms, I had a similar theory as you. Just as much of a struggle it was to get out of the band (studio door), he has yet another obstacle to get through (brick wall), but surprisingly he falls back into the studio. I feel at this point he realizes how much of a struggle it will be, continue to fight against others who become complacent, struggle with what he can/cannot control, and possibly more.

We don't have Levee's whole back story, I wonder if he had eventually killed a White man or picked up where his dad left off in killing his mother's rapists. Levee also looks like he does not want to bite the hand that feeds him with the record manager but he would rather take it out on someone else who is on his level or below.

After your line about American Dream from the director, it makes sense for it to be a shaft with a opening on top, he has to now climb to reach the American Dream instead of overcoming a brick wall.

Sorry if I got all these wrong, I haven't done these literary critical analysis since high school English. 😅",kg0hya
gm76s3b,"I think the title is Ma Rainey's Black Bottom because that's where the problems within the band start, with Levee and Irvin wanting his version while Ma and Cutler want hers, plus the whole issue with Sylvester's stammer. I think it's the title not because it's the core of the movie but because it's its beginning in a way, the tensions regarding which version to play foreshadow what's coming later.

IMO the locked door is a symbol for Levee's aspirations and dreams. He's all curious about what's on the other side and finds it's only a back alley, like he's all excited about his songs and his new band but is all but rejected. It's no coincidence both (him opening the door and Studyver saying he's not recording) happen around the same time.",kg0hya
guyirxg,"I also think Ma's strength and determination and her *NEED* for that coke weren't because she was a primadonna, but because she *needed* to exert that strength over white men in order to not get walked all over.  The juxtaposition between her and a less-thoughtful-but-equally-talented up-and-comer who gets walked on and taken advantage of is the point. I think Ma is one of two main characters in that it's a juxtaposition of different survival tactics of two black artists living in a world where their families could be lynched at any second and the only reason they have a free pass is because white people like the music they make, for now.  It's a really really brilliant and heart breaking juxtaposition but I think it takes a small part of racial inequality (music rights) and uses it to showcase the broader social/racial contexts.  I thought it was an utterly brilliant move, but I do think the script as a whole is a touch tonally choppy so it might not have come through as well as it could have. But I loved this film.",kg0hya

Ma must have gone through countless hardships, with her gender, race and sexuality all intersecting throughout her life experience. The way she was able to express herself in a world that wasn't built for her was nothing short of inspiring. She's a phenomenally strong person. 

it's wrong of me in my privelleged gaze to call her a 'bitch'. I should have said that, despite being at odds with the other characters in the film, Viola's performance grounded her and made her a likeable character.",kg0hya

ghuzx07,"I’m not black and my comment about “chickensh*t” was probably inappropriate, but “black on black violence” is just a category of “violence.” It’s a real thing, just like “white on white” violence is a real thing.

From Wikipedia:
“According to the FBI, African Americans accounted for 52.4% of all homicide offenders in 2018, with Whites 43.1% and ""Other""/Unknown 4.4%. Of these, 15.4% were Hispanic or Latino. The per-capita offending rate for African Americans was roughly six times higher than Whites, and the victim rate is a similar figure. Most homicides were intraracial, with 81% of White victims killed by Whites and 89% of African American victims killed by African Americans.”

I’m not saying black people are violent, I’m just saying that’s how I interpreted the movie’s message. Sorry if it came off like I was perpetrating stereotypes.",kg0hya

I honestly went into this thinking I would have a similar opinion, because frankly I did find the film adaptation of Fences to be horribly boring and completely pointless. The play on the other hand is terrific. To be honest though, never actually heard of this play before hearing that this movie was coming out on Netflix so I guess that changes my perspective on it a bit.

gh96fay,I think the point is that yes it was an accident but also that the recording engineer didn't do his due diligence in sound checking the mic after setting it up because he didn't take Ma and her request seriously.,kg0hya
ggepf5a,"I agree. And I loved it cuz I like August Wilson's writing. They did a good job showing history of tension between Ma Rainey and the trumpeter.

I liked this one better than Fences too because it largely stuck to the script and didn't overstay its welcome (90 minute runtime opposed to Fences which is a longer play for sure but clocks in at 2.5 hrs)",kg0hya
ggkatgf,"Agreed. I just thought the set and lighting design here were so compelling. Like, I guess the camerawork isn't *that* interesting, but its subdued approach just works really well for me.

If anything, the place where the translation fails a bit is in the tell-don't-show attitude of the script. Which isn't *that* big a deal, it's just that some of the big emotional beats, particularly early on, feel a bit more forced on film than they would on stage, because on stage we know everything *has* to unfold right in front of us so we accept these leaps but on film it's like, ""Oh now we've gotta monologue about our backstory, because you should probably hear this.""",kg0hya

I know it's the easy answer to say he doesn't, but considering the academy was willing to nominate Downey that same year, or William Hurt a few years earlier for another comic film, or Ian McKellen for Lord of the Rings, I don't think it's as out of the blue as we think.",kg0hya

gge0gj4,"I’m not saying he should win because of that I’m quite honestly against that I’m just saying that knowing the oscars, that’s one of few reasons why it makes sense for them to give it to him cause it’ll make them look good. And if Hopkins is over all better then year really he should win but i’ll still be championing Chadwick either way. Chadwick shouldn’t win the Oscar just because he’s dead or black and Hopkins shouldn’t necessarily not get one just because he’s already won one before but it just makes sense.

His best performance that I've seen. Yes you can tell the script was written for the stage but I was still transfixed by the performances in this filmed version. He's such a classically tragic figure and you could start to see his arc early on in the film. Made every moment with him ache. I didn't know where the story would take him but I knew he wasn't going to get what he wanted. That tension of high aspirations, arrogance, and youthful naivity mixed with a deep foundation of anger toward to the world was brewing up a storm. I thought he was electric",kg0hya

On that accent: he INSISTED on having one. It was also his idea that Wakandans would sometimes speak in Xhosa (a real African language). He did so much research and kept going to Ryan Coogler like, ""Hey here's a thing I learned. Can we do this in the movie?"" That work is so so important in helping Wakanda to feel like it could be a real country - like, it's literally hidden by a holographic mountain yet it somehow feels real. That's insane.

I feel like this was common across his body of work. He learned to play the trumpet for Ma Rainey. He was really dedicated to making sure his fingerwork was accurate.",kg0hya
