hpzpy0l,"I'm not a big PTA fan in general, but I really loved this movie.  I thought it was funny, beautifully shot, and wonderfully acted.  Alana Haim is rightly getting tons of praise, but I thought Cooper Hoffman also gave one of the best performances of the year.

The movie had really interesting themes about the way we deal with aging and how we view the passage of time.  Gary is a high schooler who isn't satisfied to just enjoy being a kid - he wants to grow up: have a career, start businesses, and be sophisticated.  He relishes being a regular at a nice restaurant, and brags to his friends that he could get them martinis.  It's no wonder he's drawn to an older woman like Alana and tries so hard to impress her.  

Alana, on the other hand, is stuck in a rut and struggling with adulthood.  Spending time with Gary feels like a return to earlier, simpler times.  I think her arc is especially interesting. Throughout the movie, she questions why she's hanging out with Gary and his friends instead of growing up.  After the running out of gas sequence, she seems fed up with how immature Gary is and wants to make a change.  She starts working in Sachs' office, and her relationship with Gary changes noticeably - she starts getting annoyed at him for messing up tasks and for not thinking about the  bigger picture beyond himself and his friends.  This continues up until the scene where Sachs invites her for a drink, only to reveal that she is being used as a cover.  Once Alana is reminded of how bleak and horrible the adult world can be, her first reaction is to go find Gary.  Both characters are struggling to be satisfied with where they are in their lives, and are using the other one to fill what they feel is missing. 

Most nostalgia movies show a glossy version of the past where characters are at the peak of their lives.  Licorice Pizza is a throwback movie that centers around two characters who are fundamentally unhappy with the stage of life they're in.  I found that really interesting.  It's definitely a somewhat bittersweet movie, but it's highly watchable and it leaves you with a lot to think about.",ro10uh

hqivlpb,"Watching this I felt like I was watching a modern classic. Loved it so much, especially Bradley Cooper and Bennie Safdie's arcs...

Then the ending went and ruined it.

To me, Alana's friendship with Gary needed to stay platonic from a consent standpoint, and also because Gary represents Alana's refusal to grow up. Her conversation with the gay man gave me the impression that she was going to choose not to have a romance with Gary. She should have reconciled with Gary, made it explicitly clear that their relationship was platonic, and then left him disappointed but better for it; end of movie. Alana choosing romance is creepy and completely goes against that character trajectory. The movie ends and I'm supposed to feel warm and nostalgic and wistful, but instead I feel awkward and conflicted and angry.

There's still so much to love about the movie, but damn that ending really makes me hesitant to revisit it.",ro10uh
hq45mez,"So to be clear, Alana is 28, right? In the scene in the truck when she’s talking to Bradley Cooper’s character, it seems like she kinda slips up and says she’s 28 before correcting herself to 25.

hqnt4yh,"I think the only thing I liked about this movie was the soundtrack. I do not understand all the praise it's been getting from critics and in this thread. It was a meandering plot with two mostly unlikable characters leading the way and no real story arc. I found Cooper Hoffman insufferable throughout the film, just did not like that character at all which I hope was the point? The age gap is problematic, but not as much as how weird both of their characterizations were and how they just kind of rolled with it. It's really really fucking weird for a 25 year old to hang out with high school sophomores. That's not my biggest hang-up though, it's mostly with how there were multiple absurd scenes and scenarios that just kind of materialized out of nowhere. With the bad writing and weak dialogues I just couldn't get into it at all. I don't know, this film was mostly hollow and pointless to me. 

It's very strange to read multiple comments in here referencing OUATIH and how this was PTA's take on a similar nostalgia that Tarantino went for. They couldn't have been further apart in quality for me. I loved OUATIH with great pacing and sharp dialogue along with dynamite performances, loathed this one with how weak the product was and bounced before the final 30 minutes. It was kind of entertaining in bits and pieces, but it's just such a shoddy piece of work as a whole.",ro10uh
hpwaoja,"What I loved about this film was how I related to both Gary and Alana. When I was 15, I had so much drive - taking AP classes, in speech and debate, hoping to go to Harvard law. Now that I'm 25, I feel like I'm in Alana's position. My life isn't going how I imagined it would be and I feel somewhat stuck. I'm struggling to hold on to a rapidly dwindling youthfulness while also trying to figure out how to actually make the world a better place. When you're 15, you want to be 25 and when you're 25, you wish you could be 15.",ro10uh
hq17slx,"I love PTA, and Licorice Pizza is a good movie, but ngl it let me down a bit. I felt the subplots varied wildly in quality and utility. The Bradley Cooper section was my favorite and the most engaging, but I found the Sean Penn subplot completely useless. Thankfully, Cooper Hoffman and Alana Haim carried the movie with their infectious banter, chemistry, and Anderson's excellent dialogue flowing from their mouths. Still, more than any other Anderson film I've seen, I felt self-indulgence and wonky pacing. No reason this movie had to be 2:15.

hqf9hgc,"Licorice Pizza: A critique of Nostalgic American Cinema

There is an abundance of classic films about how great life was in Hollywood or Los Angeles during the 50s, 60s and 70s. Movies I love and respect like American Graffiti and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. The problems with movies like these is that they only show a narrow viewpoint of life during the time. There’s not much misogyny, racism, anti semitism, or homophobia. It’s all sunshine, rainbows, weed, and Led Zeppelin. I think Anderson’s Licorice Pizza satirizes these films by not just glorifying the cars, vinyl records, outfits and waterbeds, but also paradoxically glorifying all the awful things that people don’t want to see in a 70s throwback. Pretty much all the men in this film are predatory and exploit women while being in positions of power. People can’t be publicly honest about their sexuality. There is constant blatant racism and antisemitism. There is no gas to fill everyone’s smog generating cars because of conflict in the middle east. Richard F—ing Nixon is president. Anderson is essentially saying, “Hey, weren’t the 70s awesome?”. 

Gary and Alana’s relationship is a microcosm of all of this. Alana is obviously struggling with adulthood and is romantically looking back at a blissfully ignorant youth. Gary is her escape back into this world. This is a lot like how many of us are sick of our modern times and yearn to have been born in a different generation. Nostalgic films are an escape. After the whole scene where Bradley Cooper’s character terrorizes half the San Fernando Valley and Alana almost kills everyone driving the truck down the hill, you can tell that Alana is fed up with all the bullshit and immaturity. She then tries out the adult world again by working for the politician Ben Safde. The scene where Alana learns that Safde’s character is gay and has to hide his sexuality is the only time we see the actuall consequences of societie’s intolerance and hate. Once Alana sees this, she goes back to Gary and blissful ignorance.

 A lot of us are probably sick of hearing about all the horrible things going on in America. We want an escape. Some sort of Fantasy of a not so distant American utopia. We may have even gone with our families or friends over the holliday to watch Licorice Pizza and reminisce about “the good ol’ days”. This movie was made to make us feel severely uncomfortable (and may have even gone a bit too far with the scenes about Asian and Jewish people). Maybe we should be grateful that we don’t live in the 70s. Our current society has a lot of problems but we are undoubtedly more aware of them and have made significant social progress",ro10uh
hqh60wu,was that creepy guy lurking outside of Wach’s office the same guy in the police station at the beginning of the film? when the police drag him out and he sees Gary and says “that isn’t him.” i thought for sure they were the same dude but i haven’t seen anyone else talk about it,ro10uh

hq86nxp,"Unsurprisingly this movie seems to be very divisive, I think it works for some people and doesn't for others. Let me preface all this by saying that I'm not challenging anyone who enjoyed it, and more power to you if you did. But personally I don't understand the hype here.

Even completely ignoring the whole weird age gap thing, I just don't find it to be a strong cinematic experience. 

It's a well made film, it has good cinematography, and a good use of soundtrack. I would even say that PTA managed to have every actor squeeze as much life out of their characters as possible, there really isn't a weak performance in the whole movie.

However, the script felt all over the place for me. The plotline meanders to and fro without care and when it finally lands it feels like just a waste of 2 hours. Having the whole age gap dynamic is actually a great plot device to explore the themes of both teenage infatuation and the ""lost"" phase of someone's 20s at the same time. On paper I should love this movie idea, as I typically gravitate towards these types of films. But I really don't think he manages to juggle both themes simultaneously very well here. Other films have captured and explored both of these themes so much better separately, so I didn't derive much from what was presented. It doesn't help that the character Alana still *acts* like a teenager rather than a 25 year old, which kind of defeats the entire point imo. I felt that Gary *did* feel very much like a teenager, so when Alana reacts to their relationship adversity with all the angst of a high school sophomore, that contrast between their two perspectives completely fades away. There are some scenes where it shines, like her awareness of the oil crisis or when she attempts her plunge into politics, but those moments are so few and far in between that she never really felt distinguished from Gary as an adult. Watching Alana try to prove to herself that she was ""cooler"" than Gary wasn't some kind of charming inner struggle, it was hard to watch. A 25 year old who has to question whether or not they're cooler than a 15 year old is still in a teenage mindset to begin with. And if that was an intentional decision about her character it begs the question, why even have her be 25? Why not just make her 18 and him like 16-17? Not much in the movie would've had to change. 

As a result most of their interactions felt like adolescent puppy love rather than a morally questionable complex love between an adult and a teenager. It felt like he didn't want to explore the implications of such an age and maturity difference completely; but if you wanted to do something like that you should go all-in rather than just hesitantly dip your toes in the water. Their entire relationship felt fabricated and forced to me, and really only existed because Alana didn't want to let him go. Not once did I really find myself caring whether or not they'd end up together, in fact there was so much on-and-off toxicity between them that I found myself actually rooting for them to find other people. The running into each other sequence at the end where they callback to previous running scenes felt so forced and unearned. Most of the romantic and sexual scenes just ended up feeling like an opportunity to make an easy joke about how teenagers view love and sex, and nothing more. 

At the end of the day it's a fun romp with memorable performances and strong art direction, but I really don't think it had much to say. It wanted to be a period piece, coming-of-age, comedy, and romance film all at once, and I think as a result it doesn't excel at being any of them. And that's ignoring all the fantastical elements of the story where you're forced to suspend your disbelief, like a 15 year old running and managing two businesses with employees 10 years his senior. 

I get why people enjoyed it, it's a pleasant movie to watch, but the moment you begin to scrape beneath it's surface it unravels completely. Just my opinion.",ro10uh
hpvog2x,"Anyone pick up on references to other films?  The one to Taxi driver wasn’t subtle at all, but the nighttime tracking shot of Gary and Alana walking definitely reminded me of Blue Velvet.",ro10uh

-Sean Penn’s character, actor William Holden, took Alana out for drinks and stumbled across Gary. It wasn’t until the second that Holden drops Alana off the back of his motorcycle to a painful fall that Gary shows any attempt at communicating with her.

-Bradley Cooper’s character, film producer/Hollywood hairdresser Jon Peters, leans right over Gary to get real close and kiss Alana while she is driving the truck. It isn’t till after Cooper’s gone that Gary acts tough as shit and starts smack talking and making fun of him to Alana.",ro10uh

People gotta get it in their heads that the movie they watch may have uncomfortable topics or events and the characters will be flawed and do things that are wrong.

Both Cooper Hoffman and Alana Haim are incredible in this. Hoffman does an incredible job at selling both the complete and utter confidence that Gary Valentine lives his life with and the little bits of insecurity that he hides beneath the surface.

PTA always manages to make his films feel completely unique from each other and he has never made anything quite like this.

The age gap just really, really stuck out to me.  Like even if he was made 17 going on 18 it would’ve been plenty of age gap and would’ve felt less…creepy?  

To be fair I was 15 in the mid 90’s and my first real girlfriend and first sexual experiences were with a 21 year old, and looking back I wonder what on earth was wrong with my parents.  Am I just looking at 1997 with 2021 lenses, and looking at the 70’s in those glasses makes for an even weirder look at what wasn’t so crazy at the time?  Not sure.  But I’d be lying if I said the 15 year old finally landing the 25 year old for a relationship didn’t take me out of it a wee bit.  

This flick needs to hurry up and get to streaming so I can watch it over a 2nd time.  Got a feeling it’s one that’ll grow on me more over time with future watches.",ro10uh
hsgdw0k,"I feel like Alana is the main character of this story, not Gary. 

My takeaway: this movie is about a girl running from adulthood and toward anyone who might see value in her. Gary is an asshole to her, but he’s also 15 and mostly just wants to get laid. Yet, he is the only man in her life who truly and consistently cares about and values her. All the other men she shows interest in don’t really give a shit about her. 

In the end she chooses him because he is the short-term answer to her problems: She remains running from adulthood and she gets to be valued and cared for at the same time. 

Good movie. Only thing that really bothered me was the ending. I wish it ended when they kissed and said “hi” to each other. Something about the “I love you Gary!” ending made me audibly groan and left a sour taste in my mouth.",ro10uh
hqa1m3u,Very good film. Glad everyone agrees on this and there is no controversy surrounding the film whatsoever. It would be a real shame if a bunch of people with the media literacy of a 3rd grader waged an ideological war against this movie in specific.,ro10uh
ht0cg9g,"Did anyone notice that in the final scenes, when Gary had his opening night at his ping pall club … he was wearing a white suit exactly like Bradley Coopers character wore? He also was acting crazy, swearing at kids, telling them - “I own this place!”, kicking bikes outside on the sidewalk. He then walked inside and started schmoozing the ladies. This was eerily similar to when Cooper was kicking trash cans down the street and then flipped a switch and started hitting on passing women while Alana sat with her head in her hands. Gary was turning into Coopers character - who Alana so obviously despised, and yet she still returned to him. 

I personally think this movie shows how men use women as pawns. Alana was used by every man she interacted with (while she also attempted to use them to escape her life). Gary held power over her, even though he was only 15 years old. In the film we see other women being used as pawns as the idiotic men around them seem to think they are brilliant and hilarious. Another example is the restaurant owner who uses his wives and talks to them in a condescending and racist way.  

It os obvious that Gary is a narcissist in the scene when Alana tries to tell him the world doesn’t revolve around him. We see Alana struggle with knowing she shouldn’t be with him. And yet, she goes back to him. 

Such an interesting film.",ro10uh
hrw3gbl,"Did I miss something?? 

This movie sucks. I almost left the theater towards the end because I was so bored.

Not only that the movie is so bad. It's about a 25 year old woman, who obviously is lacking in self love and worth and is trying to fill it with feeling sexually desired and wanted by men. She bounces from POS LVM dudes and finally had to succumb to dating a literal child. No one is mentioning this is pedophilia glorified? Seriously 13% of teachers have relationships with their students and they go to prison- it's often the exact same age gap.

Also, Gary happens to be an average looking, red head,  overweight, not particularly attractive, has acne- can't even drive a GD car because again, he's a child. Like a sophomore in highschool. Yet, simultaneously he is a successful entrepreneur just running around town with the confidence of the Sean Penn dude?? Why does this preteen manage have emotional power in this relationship... 

Then we have Alana or whatever - pretty, thin, nice hair. Yet she is 25, lives at home, and doesn't have any sense of self or worth outside of chasing around men that make her feel validated by their sexual desire for her. she literally asks Sean Penn if she is sexually attractive during a random conversation.

I like individual scenes, the technical side of the camera work, lighting, the soundtrack, the atmosphere, and of course the acting.

hpvnd5y,"4/5 stars

This movie is great in that it delivered what I think it meant to: **every character in this film is horrible and you the audience are easily deluded**. A 15-year-old is not an adult and cannot date an adult.

By design, it was impossible for me to get into the dreamy romance when every interaction screamed ""Gary is a 15-year-old child."" I was waiting for Alana, 25 (28?), to grow up and leave this boy to his already-damaged childhood but then the opposite happened.

There are no positive male characters (*maybe* the volunteer?): Bradley Cooper's is a lecher; Penn's is an old creeper; Waits's is a loudmouth drunk; Higgins's is a racist; Safdie's is a coldhearted closeted politician; and Hoffman's is charmingly manipulative. They're painted funnily enough but we're *not supposed* to like them.

And it's not just the men: the mattress saleswoman's hypersexuality; the stewardess flirting with a known child actor; Alana's sisters encouraging the relationship at every turn; and Alana who perpetuates the relationship and tempts Gary with her body (the swimsuit scene and flashing her breasts).

PTA even throws us a bone when Alana says ""well I think it's weird [that I hang out with 15 year olds]."" That's her chance to wake up but she doesn't, and it was our chance too. It's on the audience to understand that these are not characters to emulate. People see what they want to see, and clearly they're seeing that this statutory-rape-in-the-making is a viable romance.

Anderson isn't so dumb as to make a movie saying ""statutory rape is fine if the victim is a boy."" **He's pointing out a major problem to you, right in your face**: Hollywood is old, grody, homophobic, rapey, drugged out, and everyone is pretending to be someone they're not, but if they're really charming you won't even notice.

Here are several major reviewers that *barely* mention the age gap or frame it positively and completely miss the point:

>[Variety](https://variety.com/2021/film/news/eve-barlow-paul-thomas-andersons-licorice-pizza-1235141373/): ""a world in which a 15-year-old boy could order 'two Cokes' in order to seem grown-up to a girl 10 years his senior.""

>[New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/licorice-pizza-reviewed-paul-thomas-andersons-thrilling-coming-of-age-story): ""The age difference is definitive: he’s a minor, and she doesn’t even consider [a sexual relationship]. But there is an emotional relationship, an intense one...""

>[Detroit News](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/2021/12/22/licorice-pizza-review-p-t-andersons-tale-young-love-delivers/8963359002/): ""Licorice Pizza"" isn't a story about everlasting love, it's about young love, and Anderson captures the frenzied feelings of teenage affection.""

>[Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/licorice-pizza-movie-review-paul-thomas-anderson-1260170/): ""This would be the raw material for a stalker drama, were it not for the fact that both Hoffman and Haim give this opening back and forth such a nice ‘n’ easy screwball flavor.""

hpwx6y5,"Why did Cooper Hoffman’s character need to be 15, he could have been 18 and almost none of the plot would be any different. The age gap is uncomfortable because it is only acknowledged once in the film and then just dropped as no big deal. The age gap could have worked if Alana was mostly using him for money and trips and made it clear she saw him as a younger brother  which is where I thought it was going in the beginning but later we see she is jealous when he is with other girls. On a technical level it was excellent but the relationship to me played out like Rushmore if Jason Schwartzman and the teacher’s relationship was romanticized.",ro10uh

i1sv5bx,"Finally got around to seeing this. I think there are two prisms to view this movie through.

1.) This is a love letter to the 70’s. It’s an, at times, charming movie. It’s an effective hangout movie. But there are some troubling things that are tough to get over: the racist jokes and the pedophilic relationship. If you view the movie through this prism, it’s probably not going to be a movie that lands with you in the end.

2.) This isn’t a love letter to the 70’s at all. This is a critique of all the nostalgia bait movies glorifying a time that had a lot of fucked up shit going on. Racism was more normalized. Pedophilia was more normalized. Predatory relationships were more normalized. Slapping women on the ass was more normalized. Being gay wasn’t normalized. I think if you view the movie through this prism, it definitely lands. 

I don’t think there’s a right or a wrong way to view it. Art is subjective. I have thought a lot about the movie over the past 24-hours since I have seen it and have my opinion. But that’s just it, my opinion.",ro10uh
hqakfh5,"That Sean Penn riding over the fire scene may have been one of the most shoehorned scenes in movie history. PTA sure did ask you to suspend your disbelief quite a few number of times this film but that scene took the cake. 

Totally normal to get a whole restaurant to walk out from their meals, have the restaurant be ok with it, luckily have a golf course across the street, start a fire, and then watch a pointless trick and then get everybody to walk back to the restaurant 👍👍👍",ro10uh
htujdlf,"My sister's boyfriend told me this was really bad. I liked the trailers and it got good reviews, so I decided to ignore him and see it anyway. I should have listened.

I just found this to be a really uncomfortable movie. Obviously the age gap was creepy, but beyond that a lot of the humor fell flat for me. Bradley Cooper, the athiest dinner scene, the old guys jumping over fire, Garys beaver joke, I felt like that was all supposed to be funny but I just cringed. Alana maturing was probably my favorite part but the ending kind of ruined that for me.",ro10uh
hpvrj3v,"Am I weird for feeling iffy about this movie? I’ve been looking forward to it for a while now and was super excited to finally see it. I knew about the age gap, but I figured they’d make it a major point of the story. Which they did. But it seems this is one of those movies you watch and it doesn’t turn out how you want it to (me wanting Alaina to make the right decision, but her ultimately continuing to make snap spur of the moment bad decisions)

Those Asian jokes weren’t ever acknowledged other than the fact you could tell they were uncomfortable on screen. 

I know people over glorify the 60s and 70s a lot, so I guess I appreciate them not shying away from men being total creeps, especially in Hollywood. 

The age gap is weird, and I do think it’s to further play into the continuous bad decisions Alaina makes throughout this movie. The ending does not make me root for them, I was left feeling disappointed. 

It’s not a bad movie, the acting is great and I’m a fan of movies that don’t always make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. But, this just felt off. I think I need to give it another watch to further my understanding of it. 

Maybe with a name like Licorice Pizza is meant to entice you enough to try it even though you know it won’t taste good being covered with something so off-putting.",ro10uh
hpwcm4g,"this was such a charming movie.

I realized that PTA does something that is extremely hard to do: his movies for the most part have no plot. while the characters have incredible arcs and change by the end, it's a result of life just naturally happening to them. nothing feels contrived.

in a way this reminded me of a more fun phantom thread given Gary and Alana's relationship",ro10uh
hpygr69,"The whole movie seemed less like a cohesive story and just like a bunch of things just…happening? I didn’t find Gary charming at all and how could I find anything endearing about a woman who doesn’t resolves her issue of immaturity and instead indulges in a relationship with a minor 10 years younger than her? What’s the point?
I’m so surprised the reviews and people here romanticize this relationship between a fully grown adult and a child. Please reverse the roles and ask yourself if this would still fly.
Do yourselves a favor and be subjective. Remove PTA’s name from this and form your own opinion. He’s allowed to make a bad movie. Reading these reviews just feels like a joke with no punchline.",ro10uh
hq8b2dp,"Man…I just got back from seeing this in theaters and I’m questioning if we all saw the same film…I really admire PTA as a filmmaker (Master, TWBB, BN) are all favorites of mine but my god is this film wayyyyy too long for such a meandering/aimless storyline. I’m all for plotless and character driven films but at least make the characters interesting and entertaining. I couldn’t connect with anyone in this film or buy into the relationship onscreen…I just never cared for them. 

Also the cameos by the notable actors (cooper & penn) felt cheap bc they offered nothing to develop the storyline or the lead characters..it’s as if PTA just sprinkled these actors into the movie as a way to pull the viewer back in to only then disengage the audience a few scenes later.

Idk…perhaps I’m being too harsh but I’m really not seeing how this film is deserving of its 92 rating on rotten.",ro10uh
hq8xxvj,"I wasn’t as huge on the film as most but Bradley Cooper was INCREDIBLE. Loved every moment he was onscreen, everything he was doing was a hoot.",ro10uh
ht9a7ro,"Been sitting with the movie on my mind for a day or so, and even though I feel like a rewatch is necessary to render a verdict, I’m just bummed out. I did not love it.

Gary and Alana’s relationship zigs where you think it’s gonna zag the entire movie. And then that last 60 seconds or so happens. When she said “I love you, Gary” I thought it was sweet in the moment. But on the drive home, I was like wait… that’s fucking sad as hell. It was like all of what we just saw was for nothing, and no one learned anything. If it had just cut to black when they both fall in front of the theater, we might be talking about a completely different movie.

I had to watch The Master three times before I realized it’s actually a 10 out of 10. That was also not what I thought it was going to be on first watch. Maybe Licorice Pizza will render a similar revelation. But in this moment, it doesn’t feel like it will.",ro10uh
hut0b6p,"I think the movie is really, really sad in the weirdest way. I think it was pinpointing that unless we seek out the positives in life, unhappiness and pain will find us at every stage of life. When we’re little we want to be grown up and independent and we’re so ambitious just like Gary, but when we’re older and we start to understand all of these horrible things that happen and how dark the world can be and we want nothing more than to go back to our childhood days. I think Alana became so attached to Gary not because she is creepy but because she was so attached to the idea of innocence and ambition and safety that he upheld. Gary was attached to Alana because she was that free adult he desperately wanted to be. What’s interesting is that neither of them seemed to understand the pain either one was dealing with. When we’re adults we forget that we were treated as if we were stupid when we were children simply for being young. We forget that we only wanted freedom and we forget that we didn’t understand how much we had and that if we went back to being a child, it would be the same. When we’re children we cannot understand what pain will come with the loss of innocence from growing up and the heavy knowledge you gain. The ending of the movie is an ultimate failure. Not of the movie, but of the characters within. The ending is supposed to be unrealistic and disturbing with the fact of their age difference because it is showing you that if you forget to see the positives and live in the present instead of living in either the past or the future - becoming tempted by the longing of it, you will live a life that is unrealistic, unmaintainable, unfitting, and one that will ultimately continually lead to anxiety and negativity until you choose to be yourself as-is - your age included - and see the positives of the present.",ro10uh
hpw3egi,"Honestly, I love PTA but this film didn't sit well with me. It isn't JUST because of the age gap. I sat through the entire film waiting for the big epiphany to reveal itself of Gary and Alana's relationship. On one hand, I liked moments of their friendship. But, by the end, I was left with the feeling that actually this film was indeed trying to say this type of ""love"" was OK. Even considering maybe I missed something, I wasn't a fan of the ending in general. It felt rushed. Same-y. And I hated the cutting of the running from previous scenes to hammer home the point. Felt cheap, especially by PTA standards. Also, maybe this is unfair, but the random little scenes with Cooper and Penn were fun, but they truly reminded me of the vibe of certain scenes from Once Upon a time in Hollywood.",ro10uh
hpvr6ft,"I was happy to be back in a world crafted by PTA. I absolutely adore his work, Punch-Drunk Love is probably my favorite movie of all time currently, and I'd been waiting super impatiently for something new from him. So just being in a theater watching a new movie from one of my favorite directors was just a wonderful experience. That said, I was extremely turned away by the story of this film. The top comment here paints it like its *meant* to be disgusted at, and maybe it is, but that was NOT the impression I got at all, and the ending cemented that for me. I really feel like this movie was trying to invest me in these character's romantic journey but you cannot shake how completely vile it is throughout the whole film. 

Acting was stellar, direction was top notch as usual for PTA, loved the soundtrack and I thought the way the events unfold through the movie was unique and well done. But there's no way I could ever watch this movie comfortably.",ro10uh

Why did the waterbed store look empty when they made the delivery to Bradley Cooper’s house? The impression you get is that they are closing up the store, not making a delivery.

Does Gary even go to school after the first scene? 

What happened to his acting career? Did he age out? 

What about Alana’s audition and interest in acting? 

There are no outcomes from ruining Bradley Cooper’s house?

I get that the characters are a bit all over the place with their ambitious, but some amount of addressing these threads would have been welcome.",ro10uh
hq7lnju,"I’m actually pretty surprised at the level of hostility in this thread towards people with valid criticisms of the film.

Don’t get me wrong, I liked it. But I am surprised at the amount of hype and critical acclaim the film is receiving. The ending really was one of my biggest issues. I don’t think the film condoned Gary and Alana’s relationship, but the final kiss/“I love you” made me uncomfortable. Maybe that was intentional.

The age gap discourse is valid. I understand that the age gap is one of the central conflicts/plot lines, and making Gary older would make it a different movie. The age gap makes it clear that Alana and Gary both aren’t happy with their current ages/stages of life, and spending time with one another gives them what they crave. If you take away the age gap, you take away that central plot line. But it is still fair to recognize their relationship as inappropriate.

Other than that, the pacing was weird at some points, especially at the end. It felt kind of abrupt. The length felt tedious during certain scenes. The Asian racist/xenophobic jokes were inappropriate and oddly placed, and I don’t believe really served a point. 

I don’t think we were intended to root for Gary and Alana’s relationship, but the end still made me uncomfortable. Just my opinion, though. Some others absolutely loved it and some others absolutely hated it.",ro10uh
hst8ehb,"Really dug the cinematography, mise-en-scène, soundtrack(!!!), and the story. It was very cute & nostalgic & incredibly funny.  The age difference is something I think PTA handled really well, honestly—I think those saying the difference is glorified or romanticized are way off. He makes a point of showing us little moments that highlight the gap. It’s a story of love & how connections are sometimes electric & undeniable & problematic & messy, and honestly…fleeting. We’re given a fine “Hollywood ending,” but we’re never made to believe that this is all going to work out & be a happily-ever-after. So many great love stories or connections happen in such a brief moment of time. The film is weird & wholesome & ridiculous & very self-aware of its silliness.   Alana Haim fucking rocked her socks off in this movie, she’s so good.   Seeing it in 70MM was a vibe!",ro10uh
hsxyqdd,"Apparently I'm crazy for not looking this but I left the theater more unsatisfied than I had in a while. I kept expecting the events of the movie to tie together in some way, actions to have consequences, or the characters to go through any kind of development, and at the very least for a satisfying climax at the end... Especially when new characters & plot devices (The Mayor & the stalker guy) were brought up in the last 30 minutes with seemingly no payoff. 

It really felt like everything that happened throughout the movie served no purpose. Even the age gap between the leads, which I expected to translate into some kind of larger purpose realization for Alana or Gary's character, just ended up being brushed under the rug for the fairytale ending. 

 The acting and cinematography were both great, but ultimately I couldn't get invested in a movie that gives me no reason to care about anything happening on-screen.",ro10uh
hxqrzvv,Gary reminds me of james Gandolfini 's kid,ro10uh
hy7l1ar,"I loved the movie, but I understand that the controversy can turn some people off.   
  
The fact that there’s a 10-year gap between these characters, that any form of romantic relationship would be not just weird but downright illegal, and that the creepiness of the situation would be impossible to ignore were their genders reversed was not lost on me. Specially because the movie is told as a sweet love story that makes us root for the lead couple to get together at the end – and if they do, would the movie (or the filmmaker, for that matter) be endorsing a relationship between an adult and a minor?   
  
I’ll just say that, while watching the movie, it was also clear to me that Alana’s character is stuck on a cycle of bad decisions, living aimless, still searching for a purpose she thinks she should already have found. If she were to ever correspond Gary’s intentions beyond a reasonable level of platonic fondness, we shouldn’t quickly take this as a problem-free happy ending. It would be choosing escapism over reality: another questionable move from a woman who never felt ready for adulthood and still craves for the hopefulness and idealism of youth.   
  
Gary is the most idealistic of all young boys – and probably of all the grown men Alana has ever met, too. Over and over again, Alana has a glimpse of the harsh realities of adult life, where her further advancements seem to be at the hands of sexist, insensitive, hypocrite men (the movie is smart to also introduce a decent male co-worker who would clearly be her most appropriate partner, if Alana were ever capable of making healthy choices). As a contrast, Gary’s chivalry and pure affection feels like a breath of fresh air – and since his independence and proactiveness make it seem like he skipped adolescence all together, it’s easy to forget about their age difference.  
  
But the gap is there, and sometimes is impossible to ignore that Gary’s still a kid. That fantastic sequence with Bradley Cooper is a turning point. A string of immature actions put the characters into a serious, potentially dangerous situation – the kind of trouble teenagers always get themselves into, yet miraculously get away with. While Gary gleefully celebrates their triumph, Alana is shaken by the events. It’s her “I’m too old for this shit” moment. Her response is to get involved with local politics – not because she’s driven to a cause, but because it feels like the most adult thing to do. We care about the character and hope things will go well for her, but we also know enough about her and expect to be disappointed.   
  
Personally, it helped to see the movie from this perspective – as the character arc of a young woman who’s going around in circles, not really going forward, always running away from life’s challenges. It’s a story about arrested development to be read allegorically.",ro10uh
i2zplnc,"Big PTA fan generally. Was so prepared to watch this movie and come back to tell the people complaining about pedophilia how they totally misunderstood, etc.  But I can’t. This movie is fucking weird. I’m not a “movies should be moral” person at all, but the whole premise of this just creeped me the fuck out. On top of that, i found the rest of it extremely stupid and uninteresting. The Japanese restaurant owner and his wife….someone thought that was funny?    The humor throughout was completely cringe for me. I chuckled once or twice. This was nominated for best picture?

hpw26o7,"Wow, what an incredible movie! It was truly special and is an instant classic.",ro10uh
hpzzna6,"Haven’t seen too many comments mention this but what took me out of the film was the amount of detours it had. I just felt like I could never fully get into what was happening because you’d just go down a random alleyway with someone new and random. The stuff with Cooper was funny but it just kept going. The scene with the casting agent just felt super stretched out. It just felt like there wasn’t tight storytelling - which isn’t necessarily an issue - but it felt too languid. I think I was more forgiving with this type of story telling with his other, more recent films because there was a greater payoff and because the pieces felt more whole. You could've cut out the entire Jack Holden/Penn sequence and it wouldn't have made a difference. 

I think there were some genuine moments (anytime the Greenwood theme came on) and the film definitely did a good job of feeling lived in - it’s definitely evocative and transportive. I just feel like the individual moments were fleeting and never added up to something truly whole. It lingers better in my memory (saw it a few weeks ago) but don’t think it’s masterful or anything. And had it ended a couple minutes before - with them running towards each other, I think it would’ve been better.",ro10uh
hq3j0zo,"Pretty sure PTA saw Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and said to himself ' Oh, you wanna make a hangout movie set in the 70s? Step the FUCK back, it's my turn now'. 

Definitely wasn't what I expected going in and I loved a lot about it but also felt kind of lukewarm about some things. Technically it's a marvel, lot of those famous PTA long shots that he's known for. The movie looked GORGEOUS in 70mm, and the music is fantastic, great song choices. The humour is really great too, surprisingly? This is definitely Anderson's funniest film, it's like his take on a romantic comedy. Just a lot more absurdist, it's almost surreal at times in how it tells its plot. 

And that's kind of where my issues come from, I feel like PTA movies are usually very meticulous in the filmmaking and also in the story and this movie felt a little more aloof at times which is a new look for him. It's like he turned the camera on and just let people act. There's no real set structure to the plot and it's more slice of life with little chapters in these kids' lives in the 70s. It makes the movie have a lot of really great high moments (Bradley Coopers chapter is amazing), but meanders a little bit in others (Sean Penn's segment in particular). There's also a few awkward takes just in the pacing and it feels like things could've tightened up just slightly. Look at me go critiquing a master filmmaker on his editing, HA. 

That being said I think Alana Haim is fantastic throughout. Would have never known she hasn't really acted before and she carries the film in a lot of ways. Cooper Hoffman is good and you can tell he's super eager, but I found you could also tell he was trying to 'act' at times and I think a lot of that just comes from his age. He was good, just had a huge role and I don't know if he was as consistent throughout. 

I also find it hard to relate or feel happy about a love story that takes place between a 15 year old teenager (albeit a mature one) and a 25 year old woman. There's a big difference in those ages and it's straight up statutory, and while they actually had a lot of good chemistry, think the film would have been a little more believable at times if Cooper's character was at least in college instead of high school. 

Annnnnyway, i'm shittin on it a little bit but I had a lot of fun and laughed a lot. The movie feels really warm, more akin to Punch Drunk Love and Inherent Vice than The Master or Phantom Thread. 

It's kind of like Rushmore meets Dazed and Confused, and that's cool. I just wish it had a bit more structure.

hqs4kce,"I loved this movie! I am a big PTA fan, and I was looking forward to it since I saw the trailer. For the people who are upset about the age gap, I think the real issue is that Gary often isn't presented like a real 15 year old boy. If there's any ""fault"" in the film regarding this, it's that he's presented in many ways as being much older than he is.

First, he's physically big. He does have a boyish face, but he has a big body. Bigger than most of the adult men in the film.

Second, he doesn't realistically act like a 15 year old boy. Sometimes he does, and you can see some places where Alana realizes this and is annoyed, like with the gas can scene. But he's intentionally presented in many ways as being much more mature than his age. That's a choice in the script and direction.

So, I think the reason that a lot of people aren't squicked out by the age gap is that you really wouldn't notice it except that it was intentionally pointed out. There isn't really any big power imbalance between them. Gary does partially like Alana because she's older, and he's obviously craving maturity. And Alana obviously likes the attention Gary gives her. But they both give each other things the other needs and it doesn't feel like anyone is grooming anyone else. If neither's age was revealed, as someone quite a bit older than both of them, I would have just assumed they were relatively close in age.

I do wonder why PTA made that intentional choice to make the age gap so large as to be controversial. If Gary had been 17/18 and Alana 22/23, I think the themes could have remained the same without making people feel weird about it. Because I was totally rooting for them to get together the whole time, and yet it's entirely unrealistic that a 15 year old boy and 25 year old woman are going to work--because real 15 year old boys are not like Gary Valentine.

Someone mentioned Harold and Maude, but if anything, Gary reminds me more of Max Fischer in Rushmore.",ro10uh

It's not even that I don't like slow movies - Spencer and The Green Knight are my movies of the year and both of those move at just as slow if not a slower pace than LP.

The dialogue felt constantly unnatural (especially for a 'slice of life' film) and not a single character did I find interesting or likable. And at the end of the day, I don't really know what this movie was trying to tell me. Love transcends everything, including inappropriate age gaps? No thanks.

He shoots on 35mm using a lot of natural lighting and spotlights which gives a very tactile feel and a physicality to the visuals. The lights glow in the night and the San Fernando Valley days bask in sunlight. These scenes play out almost like how we remember moments of our lives and just like life, it's just a series of tangents and seemingly random occurrences. 

This film also takes a lot from Phantom Thread in that we are following the relationship between two complex people. We have Gary, a 15 year old going on 30. He talks, walk, smokes and charms like an old timey actor and hustles like any aspiring businessman. And we have Alana who's struggling with her adulthood and her relationship with Gary. What I appreciated is how much we are put in either person's perspectives. Whether we agree or not, the lense is through their eyes and their feelings. Even regarding the ending, we see them kiss in a happily ever after sort of way. In the characters minds it seems very right, but we the viewer are left wondering, is it? 

The relationship between the two is sweet, inappropriate, sometimes healthy, sometimes unhealthy, but definitely captivating thanks to the performance between the two leads.",ro10uh

I'd maybe give it a 7 or 7.5/10. It's a well made movie, but I wouldn't put it as one of PTA's best or as one of the years best either.

Also, don't really have a problem with their ages because Alana isn't some child predator. She doesn't have a thing for boys, she never thought she'd fall in love with Gary.

hs65f3i,"I think PTA gambled a bit too much on the audience's intelligence and media literacy. The film does not work on a thematic level without the age gap being what it is and the audience being (correctly) weirded out by it. 

The movie is thematically pretty solely Alana's with Gary being a constant to drive the plot along. Throughout the film we see Alana trying to grow up, further her career, and find her place in life. The three big vignettes all have her deal with much older men who are despicable in different ways, rarely if ever interacting with people her own age. Each time she becomes disillusioned with the ""adult world"" and runs, sometimes literally, back to Gary. Flipping between the two extremes of adult life and childhood. She clings to the childish immaturity of Gary as an attempt to keep herself from going older. 

Where the age gap comes into play is that we the audience know they cannot be together. It's outright weird and uncomfortable and bound to blow up eventually. The audience should be weirded out by it in the same way they're weirded out in real life by people trying to act 20 years younger. It's the long form cinematic equivalent of the ""How do you do, fellow kids"" meme. Time passes and you will always be growing older, completely unable to truly be a kid again, as much as you would like to be.

hqbhb1q,"All of this bitching and moaning about the age-gap and the *broader implications* seem so performative. PTA made this film for at least two reasons: one as an homage to the IRL crush HAIM Relative hot teacher of his past.

Two to see if he can craft a narrative wherein at the end of the movie about a 15 year-old and a 25 year-old, you not only *dont* want any legal consequences for the 25-yo, but are actually kind of rooting for them despite the weirdness. 

In twenty years he’ll be 35 and she’ll be 45, is that so weird? It’s ballsy that the film doesn’t take the easy way out and have them meet up again once he’s 18. 

  
I saw somebody in this thread say something about how “they probably would/will forget each other after enough time” and I find that take shockingly unsupported by the events of the movie. Like, did we see the same movie? They may not live happily ever after but Gary Valentine is never forgetting Alana Kane and Alana Kane is never forgetting Gary Valentine. Too much happens in the movie, they spend too much time together, what kind of disposable lives must one live if they think these two would ever forget rolling down a hill backwards together trying to get away from a violent sex pest.",ro10uh

hs9jqij,"Alana has one of the most subtle, almost unnoticed arcs in recent film history: She snaps  when her sister Danielle advises her to fight with people less. She clearly stands up for herself, she blows up at the atheist, Jew potential boyfriend who has disappointed her, she shouts at her father, she hilariously attacks her sister for ""thinking""  and finally she shouts ""Fuck you Danielle!"" and storms off. But there is evidence she is becoming self aware, more ambitious, and willing to pick her battles. Alana does push back at Gary for insisting she make her her sales pitch more sexy. When hearing Jon Peter's coked up declaration of ""loving tail."" too much, she smile and does not comment, no use interacting with someone evidentially who is potentially psychotic. When finding the political candidate was using her as a cover for his in the closet homosexuality, instead of getting angry she shows compassion to his boyfriend, in a clear tip  to she knows not everything is about herself. Even when dealing with the creepy political spy across the street she confronts him, and then wisely backs down. Alana by the end of the film in a still ambiguous ending that we do not know their future declares to Gary she loves him, and just smiles with exasperation when he introduces her as his wife ""Alana Valentine.""

hpvne35,"I’ve been waiting for this discussion.

Since I’m in LA, I got to see this in 70mm at the Regency Village Theater in Westwood a few weeks ago, and it was truly a treat. This had been a pretty disappointing year for me in terms of being let down by some of my favorite filmmakers (Edgar Wright and Wes Anderson, particularly), so to have PTA come along literally at the end of the year and knock it out the park with this, made up for what a disappointing year in cinema this had been.

That being said, I’m pretty sure I had the biggest smile on my face throughout the entire film. It seriously made me feel like a high schooler falling in love again. Not to mention, seeing this in a full house was an absolute blast. The truck driving backwards scene got a huge cheer from the audience, and I’m 100% sure that the shot at the end of that scene where the camera holds on Alana’s face in the mirror was meant to provoke that type of reaction from the audience, so bravo.

My only critiques of the film were that it could have done with some chapter titles to help with the pacing, the joke with the guy trying to speak Japanese didn’t land as well as it could have, and the last shot was god awful. It would have been perfect if it ended after they both say “hi” but the ADR’d line of “I love you” as they both run just didn’t sit right with me. It was redundant. I wonder if they changed that in the theatrical release, though?

Regardless, I don’t know how he manages to do it, but PTA outdoes himself with each new film. It really adds to this film’s strengths that the two leads have never acted before because it really adds to the effect that it looks like a long lost film from the 1970s that’s just seeing the light of day.

10/10 for me.",ro10uh
hpwakx9,"I saw the 70mm showing a few weeks ago.  Super excited but came out super iffy with the movie after seeing it.

I had fun, liked it a lot and would have considered it my fav film of the year but the last 10 minutes of the movie are way too problematic to forgive and of course there a lot of other issues.

- The asian joke is worthy of the outage.  It wasn’t funny and my theater had some laughs but it was mostly dudes and white dudes when I looked around.  And maybe 1 or 2 female laughs.  One guy cackled hard 🤮 but the joke wasn’t funny, its offensive, it served no purpose and is something that belongs on a script cut or cutting floor.  PTA’s defense was hogwash.  Just because we know something is wrong or has happened in life, doesn’t mean it had to be shown. Especially for laughs.  There is not one bit the asian characters make fun of him, or even have their voice heard or even asian characters talking behind his back.  That works, but all we get is racist white guy investing.

- The film drags towards the end.  The last 15 mins don’t seem to really go anywhere after the terrific bradley cooper scenario.  Easily forgivable but it builds to the problematic ending.

- Alana gets even worse as a character, ditches her chill age appropiate bf so she can sleep with the politician and is hurt when hes gay.  Smh.  Then she runs to little Hoffman and he runs to her and its played as all romantic and touching.  Then they kiss, and run away and she says I love you in the most cringe way and they hold hands during the credits with happy music & sunset.

- You also have the creepy douchebag banging the pinball machine and threatening lil hoff and then hes humping este in the background while she plays pinball as in to imply they are hooking up? Like what?  And at the same time, Danielle gives the thumbs up for her sister and the kid to date.  Go get em tiger, wtf is this spiderman 2?

I have seen people say weird excuses like, alana is immature for her age and he’s mature.  He’s still 15 and she is 25.  Its still gross.  I am hearing oh the relationship won’t last and its a cynical ending.  Glad to see that interpretation but this isn’t Phantom Thread.  This is heavily implied to be a happy ending with music, the directing and editing and credits.  Like a typical rom com or as I mentioned its the same happy ending as spideeman 2 or even like Punch Drunk Love (which I adore).  Some say they are toxic, uhm you can say that about most rom coms.  And the oh he doesn’t look 15, oh fuck off.  Most actors never play their ages.  Especially when the film tells me multiples times hes 15 or the other excuse, she could be 22 and lying about her age.  Oh so 22 year olds dating 15 year olds is okay? 

How it should have ended? Them going their own ways in a La La Land manner. There was a line and it can’t be crossed. I don’t mind the flirtations and attractions.  That feels real & honest because I was in a similar situation at 15.  As much as I wanted and realizing it as I got older, I understood why it was wrong and nothing happened.  And alana already had a decent bf by the end.  Better yet, Rushmore does this beautifully. It can never be but there can be something.

And they could have aged lil hoff up anyway.  He didn’t have to be 15. Him being 15 added nothing to the plot.  You would still have the same movie with him as 19/20 and it would work.

But that’s my two cents.  I am glad to see others realizing it.  I really wanted to like it and I love PTA, but at a certain point we have to call out our favs.",ro10uh
hpvtzg9,"It seems a strange time to make a movie that romanticizes the unhealthy relationship between an adult and a teenage boy ... and an even stranger time for critics to be celebrating it.

I admit that it took some daring to make this film with this questionable subject matter, but confidence isn't enough. Intelligent films should examine doubtful scenarios, not glorify them uncritically. Merely because the characters justify something to themselves doesn't mean that the film - or its reviewers - have to fall in line, too. 

And, for anyone who seeks to ignore the queasiness of the central premise, the film doesn't even work on its intended level as a crowd-pleaser. 

Anderson is clearly doing something in the register of Cameron Crowe but the script doesn't take us anywhere particularly fresh nor does it feature any discipline in terms of the comic situations. These scenes - a thicket of false-starts and dead ends - aren't very clever or suspenseful, as Anderson rolls out a series of annoying cameos from stars playing dress-up as would-be colourful characters.

Frankly, even the most sympathetic of viewers could see that the film would benefit from a more disciplined running time. 

What else could you say about a film whose standing joke is the spectacle of poor John Michael Higgins performing an apparently comical Japanese “accent” in not one but two protracted scenes?

Nothing to keep me engaged at all.",ro10uh
hr5qgyy,"I see people upset that the film doesn't necessarily condemn their relationship but why does it need to? I know the relationship (or any relationship with between two people of those ages) is wrong, and that's good enough for me. I don't ever need a film to ""agree"" with my viewpoint. Or even ""disagree"" with it. I like that PTA treated it with an objective lens and just gave you a controversial love story, where he fully fleshed out their personalities and gave you just enough insight into their (past) lives to understand why they'd fall for each other and then left you to observe the ride and in the end think of it what you will. I love movies that don't cater to anyone's sensitivities. We are all adults and thus shouldn't need to be told how to feel.

Anyway I loved it. It's one of my favourite PTA movies. It was absolutely beautifully shot, I loved the opening tracking shot, by not cutting away at all during the two leads' first conversation it allowed a certain continuous flow between them from that point on the chemistry between the two was established and I bought their budding romance. The cinematography was gorgeous and all the running scenes were shot wonderfully too. I'll admit I even ran home (which wasn't far) after watching the movie just because those sequences put me in the mood and I wanted to feel like the characters. I thought the acting was fantastic. Cooper Hoffman was fantastic. He plays this teenager that's kind of obnoxious and immature but has *juuust* enough charm and charisma where you're like ""you know what, he can be a bit much but I kind of like him."" Alana Haim gave a fantastic performance as well and I'd say was even responsible for most of the laughs in the movie. I think I'll check out HAIM so I can see her musical talents as well. Bradley Cooper...just the way he walked was hilarious let alone the rest of his performance.

hro1a3z,"In my reading Alana has the bigger arc: Alana in banter exaggerates Gary is ""12"" an insult.

Alana also lies to Jon Peters that her age is ""28"" she lies to the customer when selling the water bed. She claims to be a good actor. What do actors do? They play fictional made up characters for a living. She is a changing her life, making it up as she goes, and the catalyst is her recognizing Gary's legit ambition. Alana is telling the truth, when she says she doesn't know what her future holds, but after meeting Gary she becomes ambitious about wanting love and success. Alana who doesn't take shit from Gary, her father, her sister, not even the creepy guy spying on the Wachs campaign,  ( a dirty tricks professional political operative)
 By the end of the movie with it's literally close to Hollywood ending her experiences have uninhibited her agency 100%, she does not give a shit about social norms, at this point her sisters support her, and declares her love for Gary. Perhaps she sleeps with him, she did not the whole movie, perhaps in a short three years when she is actually 28, and he is 18 they get married.. maybe they do live happily ever.. whatever she will not stay in neutral, she knows how to shift and drive even when unexpected things out of her control happen, she exerts as much control in steering her life as she can.

hpw9ejv,"I'll paste here what I wrote when I first saw it a month ago:

""Licorice Pizza is an interesting film with some fun moments, but its uncomfortable premise leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

I'll at least start with what I liked. I thought the performances were enjoyable. I thought Cooper Hoffman did all right with what he was given in his role as Gary, but Alana Haim absolutely killed it in this movie. The role was clearly written with her in mind and it's pretty obvious to see why. Also, huge props to Paul Thomas Anderson for choosing two (relatively) fresh faces as the leads for this film.

Now I'll just run through a check list of moments that were fun in the movie. I absolutely love the Jewish representation in this movie. All 3 Haim sisters are great here and there's great scene involving a Shabbat dinner that I won't go into too much detail about. Sean Penn is really fun in this movie, and I think his character is really enjoyable for as over-the-top as he is. Bradley Cooper's part in this movie is hilarious. Every moment he's on screen is an absolute joy, and he got some of the most consistent laughs in the theater. I wish there was more of him in this, but he definitely didn't overstay his welcome.

I also like the music in this movie. It's a solid selection of pre-existing tunes. Jonny Greenwood's score is also really good here, but it's a shame that it only appears in like two scenes in the whole film.

Okay, now let's talk about the more problematic parts of this movie. The main one that everybody talks about is the age gap between the two protagonists. And it really is a problem here. Hoffman's character is 15, and Haim's character is supposed to be 25. That is a 10 year age gap! I remember being uncomfortable by the age gap in Call Me By Your Name, but the characters in that film were 17 and 24 -- only a 7 year age gap, and considering that both were over the age of consent in Italy, it seems much more tame in comparison. Meanwhile, Licorice Pizza expects us to root for these two characters to get together, even though he is in high school and she is old enough to have graduated college.

I know some will argue that the movie is supposed to be depicting a complicated relationship and that it doesn't explicitly condone this behavior. And there's a little bit of a point there, the film does vaguely touch on the weirdness of the age gap between the two. But the film's ending is the two of them kissing and Alana says ""I love you Gary"". I can't really read this ending as anything other than the film approving of this relationship. And I just don't understand how anyone can see this and think it's acceptable, or at least not incredibly uncomfortable. There is absolutely no reason why PTA couldn't have made Gary's age 18 instead of 15. It still would have been a pretty awkward age gap, but at least it wouldn't be borderline illegal.

And this age gap also really makes both protagonists pretty unlikeable. Gary is kind of a creep who is chasing after someone old enough to be his teacher. And apparently we're supposed to be cool with his behavior because he almost groped her but decided not to??? On the other hand, it's really hard to sympathize with Alana when she ends up dating someone 10 years younger than her. It's just uncomfortable, and if the roles were reversed it would be a textbook case of grooming. I have a ton more I could say about how horrible this age gap makes this movie, but this is turning into a ramble.

Moving on, there's also some really racist jokes at the expense of Asians in this movie. There's one white character who talks in a really stereotypical Asian accent, and it's played for laughs, which is super uncomfortable. It doesn't feel like meaningful commentary and it doesn't really contribute anything to the movie as a whole.

There's one more part that I've heard people describe as problematic, and that's the portrayal of its gay characters. I actually thought this was really well done. Benny Safdie plays a politician running for office who has to hide from the public that he's gay, and this part of the movie was executed really well. It's pretty much all done through really overt subtext, but it doesn't hit the audience over the head with it. And there's a great scene that takes place at a restaurant between him, Alana, and his boyfriend, that's one of my favorites in the movie. Overall I actually thought this subplot was really good, and I wish more of the movie was this tasteful.

Before ending this review, I'm going to go through my other criticisms of this film: The plot was just pretty boring. It reminded me a lot of Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, which also felt like a meandering love letter to the Los Angeles of old. The difference is that Tarantino at least knows how to make an uneventful plot entertaining, and PTA does not. It's a pretty meaningless coming-of-age story that feels like it has no thematic cohesion or purpose, which is really disappointing, because there are quite a few moments that I like in this movie.

Ultimately, Licorice Pizza offers solid direction, some great performances, and quite a few memorable moments, but its meandering plot offers very little in the way of meaningful themes and commentary, leaving only its most problematic elements to stick with me after the credits.""

hpzg3mn,"was the age gap really as severe as they make it out to be on the surface? when she first says she's 25 she stumbles on it and it sounds like she's lying, and then later she lies and ages herself up even further. the way she bungled her martini order during the scene with the politician made it sound to me like she was not even of drinking age.",ro10uh
hpvu52v,"Just saw this film and it's pretty top-tier, which is expected of Anderson. I wish I could see it again quickly to be more certain of my thoughts but I have my initial impressions.

This film presents the relationship between Alana and Gary as something similar to what we see in Punch-Drunk Love. At times, even the score would call me back to euphoria I feel when Barry and Lena are reunited at the end of Punch-Drunk Love; there are these tentative notes in the score of Licorice Pizza that seems as if it's trying to veer up towards that same feeling of romance but it never quite seems to get there. To me, that seems rather intentional and I would imagine Greenwood listening to Punch-Drunk Loves soundtrack would not be outside the realm of possibility.

Which brings me to my main point; I don't think we, as the audience, are intended to feel giddy about the potential of a romantic relationship between Gary and Alana. I think this may have less to do with age and more to do with their practically play-acting and this is not a knock on the actors performances.

After the scene with Alana and Jack Holden at dinner, where she asks him something like, ""Are these lines or is this real?"" That caused me to recall the initial meeting between Gary and Alana; he's tapping into his actorly roots and she's trying to exude a maturity that she just does-not-have. They're literally playing roles for each other and it caused me to question their initial meeting. There's likely no question Alana is too old for Gary as she's an adult; but I was left even questioning her age. She claims to be twenty-five but she has elder sisters who do not seem to be on the brink of spinsterhood, pardon the term. She brings home a nice Jewish boy as a potential husband who, in the context of the film, is likely in his late teens. She's seemingly never had alcohol before, either.

Then you have Gary who, outside of one scene, is never in school and is only ever seen to jump from one business venture to the next. 

All in all, the romance is very strange; it's almost as if Anderson thought, what if I took the romance of Barry and Lena and perverted it with an alleged age gap? It brought to mind Phantom Thread which does something similar; what if twisted power plays skew what might have been a typical period romance?

I even wondered as to the setting of the film. Would Alana and Gary's perceived romance be less palatable if it were set in the present?

In any case, I know there's a lot of controversy surrounding the age gap. I'm of the mind that whatever kiss they shared at the end is likely to be there last. I think with all the previous events of the film, I don't think we're intended to believe that whatever relationship they might have would have any degree of permanence. 

Still, I think I might have loved the film overall and can't wait to see it again. I think, in a similar way to Phantom Thread, it might improve on second viewing and settle any wandering thoughts I have on the film.",ro10uh

Gary is 15, seemingly self made already and responsible for watching his 8 year old brother even though it could be viewed more of a father / son + cool Mary Elizabeth Ellis casting,  Alana, 25, represents moreso the youth of today whom blossom into adulthood later, her  home life is much different living under the roof under her overprotective father and annoying older sisters which can destroy your spirit.

The scene where Gary is falsely accused of murder and taken to the police station before being released after the witness identifies him as the wrong guy. 

What is the significance of this storyline. I was waiting for it to come back in some way or have some effect on the later part of the narrative, but no. Gary and Alana's reactions also seemed kind of strange to me. He did not seem surprised at all even though he is apparently being accused of a murder he did not commit and she first hugs him, then is angry and then suddenly runs with him happily.

Am I missing something?",ro10uh

However I found it refreshing that in a movie the older person was a woman as opposed to the male. That never happens in movies. On top of that she wasn't predatorial. I also had the impression that the movie took place over an extended period of time so Hoffman got older which made it more age appropriate. 

At the end of the day she wasn't predatorial. They were charming together so im largely ok with it.

I can’t but think of the gender if the characters was switched, this would’ve been talked about more. Maybe even created some conversations around age gaps at that time, the young “girlfriends” of pop stars (who are still around and active) etc.

I loved the look of the film, the acting was great, Alana is awesome (though her character very unlikable), Cooper Hoffman was good and reminded me of his father, the clothes lovely, even the script at times was OK - though mostly confusing, disjointed and lazy.

At the heart of it, however, it’s a film about a 25 year old woman and a 15 year old boy falling in love. While there is no overt inappropriate sexual behavior between these characters, it unambiguously tells us that these two basically can’t help falling in love. I can’t help but wonder if everyone would be so gushy and glowy about the film if it were about a 25 year old man falling in love with a 15 year old girl. In today’s climate, it frankly surprises me that I scroll through the posts here and only see casual references to “the age gap” being “a problem” - for the characters, not the audience.

hr9duwj,"Yet another utterly fantastic film made no fun to talk about thanks to insufferable social media discourse, which has done a bang-up job at showcasing certain people's complete lack of media literacy and how strangely proud they are of just that. This is more proof that Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the greatest filmmakers working today, crafting a film that's equal parts a beautifully recreated ode to the San Fernando Valley of the early 1970's, an infectiously enjoyable hangout comedy, and a deeply complicated portrait of a toxic, wayward love between two immature, naïve, ultimately broken and lost young souls.",ro10uh

hq8d99v,"tbh i think the relationship worked for this movie. unequivocally wrong and clearly unhealthy but that’s how it is to be young stupid and in love. this movie is about enjoying the good before the inevitable bad sets in- gary is gonna grow up to be just as sleazy and shallow as the adult men, they’re all gonna get old and weird, we know the political situations in this movie only get worse, and the two of them are fundamentally incompatible, but hey, here’s a little bit of fun and comfort right now, let’s hold onto that before we face the bad. just like real-life love, the anticipation is the best part, so it was a smart choice to only have everything come crashing down after the credits. maybe i’m being a little generous but it felt so wholesome and free and was much needed in the pandemic. the age gap is icky but i think it’s presented with such nuance that it feels like a believably messy real life relationship. a lot of people have been in relationships like this (age aside) and that’s just how adolescence is. and the fact there’s not really a power dynamic between them eases it too. he likes to show off and she likes the attention. every adult is a self-important phony, it’s hard to fault her for looking for excuses to stay in the world of the youth, the only people in the movie who are honest and free. 

it meandered at some points- the dinner before the motorcycle jump kind of bored me, and i think some of the long shots were kind of not necessary, but overall it was beautiful. so fast paced with such a wonderful sense of movement. that long take at the teen fair was a delight, as was the crowd shuffling around as one organism at the motorcycle jump. hoffman and haim had great chemistry, both were fantastic, and i appreciate them looking like real people. i really admire how it made by all means average looking people so beautiful just through their expressions and quirks and how deeply we get to know them",ro10uh

Gorgeous looking movie. Not sure what to think about the age difference. I was rolling my eyes at the Twitter noise before seeing the movie, but I can see why some people would be upset now having seen it.

But this world we’re living in now is not the world that PTA wanted to visit. That age difference was a lot more common in the 70s than people want to admit. That’s just a fact.

Still I’m not sure why PTA felt the need to approach it this way. I kept thinking about if I was Alana and I was following around a 15 year old girl and ahhhhh. It stopped being charming. 

But there was a ton of interesting characters and it was a fun time. Gorgeous movie (seriously what the fuck, everything looked so good) and killer music.

hqq3odb,"I liked it, but didn’t love it. Alana Haim and Cooper Hoffman were charming and talented leads, there were some entertaining and funny moments (Bradley Cooper was hilarious). But it had some stretches where it really drags and moments that flopped (Sean Penn’s whole sequence), and it was kinda aimless and structureless. I don’t think it was bad, but it’s probably Paul Thomas Anderson’s weakest film (so naturally, it’ll probably win him his first Oscar, and then be remembered as one of those moments where they gave it to him because he was “due” instead of for his better earlier works).

I saw it as kinda an “anti-“ to typical nostalgic period pieces, young Hollywood romances, and coming of age films (“deconstruction” might be too strong a word). The 1970s setting looks garish and ugly, and the glimpses of Hollywood we see are unglamorous and full of awful people. The much-discussed age gap between its two main characters fits into this. Through Gary, a 15-year-old child actor, we see both the young naive teenage view and fake Hollywood view of such a romantic relationship. Through Alana, a regular working woman who’s 25, we see an adult and realistic view of it. Gary thinks he’s truly in love and destined to be with her like so many romances in the movies. On the other hand, Alana half the time seems more annoyed with him than anything, sometimes feeling like his reluctant chaperone. And though she seems to like him in other scenes, she clearly know that any relationship she might have with him isn’t going to work. At times, she even seems to only spend time with him because she sees him as her ticket to something better, be it an “in” to the movie business or a chance to make money in his business ventures. When the two run to meet and kiss at the end, from Gary’s perspective, it’s a Hollywood ending; for Alana, it’s only after her latest personal setback (it felt a lot like the ending of The Graduate, in that it’s filmed like a Hollywood “run into the sunset” moment but is undercut by the fact that if you think even a little bit past this moment, it’s not going to work out or last).

If you want to make a REALLY cynical reading of the picture, it’s a fairly tragic story about how a hard-working woman can’t catch a break—Alana is hit on by teens and sexually harassed in her photography job, she’s seen as only the showroom model in a bikini in the waterbed store despite being a partner in the business, no one in the movie business cares if she can act or will even remember her and just see her as their latest squeeze, and she works so hard for the councilman running for mayor but he makes her do menial and degrading work like being a beard for his partner—while a kid not even out of high school is rich and connected and able to build successful businesses with little effort or trouble.

In a Q&A with Cooper Hoffman and PTA, PTA said Cooper had extensive acting experience with his son in home movies. But PTA only has daughters from everything I’ve read about him.

Just curious how a no-name got into Julliard and then immediately went into a Spielberg project and then this. Both of Spielberg’s daughters were in this movie so maybe it was a favor for both sides?

Overall, it was an enjoyable film about life in the Valley and the weird wacky characters that inhabit it (but I do think nostalgia places it more dear in a lot of people’s hearts than mine in particular). The age difference of the characters was bit strange to me. Wonder why they couldn’t have placed them a little closer in age to make it a bit more palatable. 

The acting was excellent, especially for these newcomers. Never knew the Haim sisters could act, and I kept seeing glimpses of Phillip Seymore in his son. I wanted to see more of Bradley Cooper. His character was unhinged, coked-up,  and mesmerizing to watch. That’s definitely a Paul Thomas Anderson character.

There IS one scene I would like to know more about. The dinner scene with Wachs, Alana, and Matthew his lover. The way it was shot was a little different than how Paul Thomas Anderson shoots. With very extreme close-ups, almost uncomfortably close. Which is very resembling to the style of the Safdie Brothers (Good Time, Uncut Gems).

But now a few days ago the world dragged Zoe Kravitz for flirting with 15 year old Jaden when she was 25. I'm just confused. PTA doesn't see these characters as bad people surely. What's he even getting at here?",ro10uh

hpvunvg,"This is one of PTA’s best. It’s loose, free, and awash in tenderness. 

Haim and Hoffman are electric for being “untrained” actors. PTA knows exactly how to capture them on film, the lingering shots on their faces until the emotion erupts out of them is electric. The phone scene and the Let Me Roll It needle drop standout. 

Loved the kinetic energy of the film as well. Told in a similar vignette style as INHERENT VICE but propelled forward by characters literally running (similar to the Joaquin/Waterston Neil Young rain scene in IV) throughout the film.",ro10uh

hqdcp2m,"2021 has been a year of total disappointment for me. After having one of the worst weeks of my life, I was hoping this film would turn it around for me. Reading all the praise and glowing reviews weeks beforehand led me to believe this would be one of the best of the year, but of course my expectations were raised too high and it fell *mighty* short for me. 

Alana Haim was definitely enormously watchable and easily the best part of the movie. I could have watched her for hours, but I don't know if that's because of her natural acting style or because she's uniquely attractive (it's easy to see it from Gary's perspective and form a crush on her). I also thought Bradley Cooper was hilarious and was massively disappointed that we never got to see his reaction to his house being destroyed (they could have tagged it at the end of the cast billing). Also really funny to hear John C. Reilly as Herman Munster in his one-second cameo.

The film's meandering style did not necessarily hold my attention (I couldn't really follow all the business schemes that were being concocted), but the central love story is what kept me invested. I'm really fascinated by people's exaggerated reactions to older/younger relationships, especially when both parties are interested and it's completely consensual. I really don't see the big deal, aside from the legal repercussions, which shouldn't inform art or limit storytelling. When I was 15, I was attracted to all manner of females and would have been so fucking happy to form a consensual relationship with someone twice my age. In some ways, it's like fulfilling a fantasy I never got to have. I'm not sure when people became so prudish and overly sensitive to these issues, as if they've never been young before and attracted to someone out of their age range. We're human, it happens.

Red Rocket is an even more extreme example of an age discrepancy (17 and 40), and rather than feeling gross or being creeped out, I am insanely jealous of anyone who is able to pull something like that off. I've been alone the majority of my life and missed out on so many experiences. I guess that's why films like these tend to depress me more than impress me.",ro10uh
hpw0hp2,"it was SO good. I went into this movie with such mixed feelings because of the discourse surrounding the age gap/grooming but… the age gap was constantly being acknowledged as weird and that was literally the entire point of the film. it’s supposed to make you feel uncomfortable and none of the characters were necessarily glorified imo. they were all terrible in their own ways. we were definitely not supposed to think that alana made good decisions, it’s quite the opposite. she was SUPER messy and spent the entire film doing questionable things with questionable people. and what baffles me the most is that just because something is being portrayed in a film does not mean it’s okay in real life. this film also wasn’t supposed to be hyper realistic. like there is a 15 year old boy opening up his own store and running businesses when he’s supposed to be in school. idk I loved it",ro10uh

hr7xf22,I feel like a crazy person after watching Licorice Pizza. The movie is a romantic film that explores the relationship between a 15 year old and and 25 year old. Why? Because the director wondered what would happen if an adult dated a kid hitting on her after witnessing it. Plus some personal anecdotes from friends lives. I thought the interactions between the characters were super unrealistic and the inherently problematic nature of an adult having a romantic connection with  a child isn’t explored at all.

hxjk8yu,"I'm so confused by this film.  It got nominated for best original screenplay, but it almost seemed like it was just all improvised.

And what happened to the beautiful cinematography we have seen in other PTA joints?

I don't need a movie to be plot heavy, sometimes character studies can be a beautiful thing.  But this film never really went deep on character, and it had a lot of plot in a way but would just sort of meander from one thing to another and then just drop things as soon as they looked like they might go somewhere, and move on to something completely different.

None of the dialogue or acting was especially scintillating.

I did think the restaurateur who spoke in a comical Japanese accent was pretty funny.

I give it 6/10 but I feel like I'm being fairly generous with that rating.  If someone has never seen a PTA film, there are several I would steer them to first: Hard Eight/Sidney, Magnolia, or Boogie Nights.  The Master is a tier down IMO but it is a deeper character study than LP, with better dialogue and acting and much more beautiful cinematography.  TWBB is not my cup of tea, but I can at least understand why people love it.  With LP I can't imagine why anyone would think it's more than just ""pretty good"" or ""not bad"".

(The controversy element doesn't bother me at all.)

ETA: And I somehow forgot to mention Phantom Thread!  His most recent previous film, and vastly better than this one.  Also better than The Master IMO, it just slipped my mind.",ro10uh

hq62ids,"I'm not a die hard PTA fan but have enjoyed all of his work that I have seen; most notably There Will Be Blood, Boogie Nights, and Magnolia. I knew this was going to be good, but I straight up loved this movie. The acting, the vibe and atmosphere, the soundtrack, the cinemaphotography, the plot. Even the characters, which can be surprising for me, as I usually tend to find something unlikable that has me not caring about their outcome or even rooting against them. For Gary and Alana, I genuinely wanted the best for both of them in the end. As in - as individuals and not so much as a couple, but either way if they had ended up together or not would have been fine with me. 

However reading through this thread I was also surprised to find so many offended by the age gap, to the point they could not focus on the plot (although it should have probably been expected), or suggested that the ages should have been adjusted. I just don't get it, I guess. It was not a completely innocent relationship, but there was not even any physical contact until the end of the movie, which was only in the form of a kiss. They were never even in any kind of exclusive romantic relationship and they both saw other people throughout the movie. I don't know, just feels like another thing to be forced outraged about.

Anyway, 10/10",ro10uh
hqr8v54,"You're supposed to feel tension interacting with this movie. With the age gap. With almost every man who interacts with Alana. I mean her boss slaps her ass in the first 10 mins of the movie. With Alana and Gary. 

It's doesn't have a plot because it doesn't need one, it's a slice of time, a slice of living. And the tension that comes with that. Think about the back and forth of joy to despair? It's constant in the movie. Any high point felt by a character is almost immediately hit with a low point. 

Is it at times slow? Sure. Though I think the acting makes up for it. And there's so much detail to the acting in this one(see the agent scene where Alana is looking to act, I don't know the actresses name who plays the agent, but she owns that scene).

I think the one of the most telling scenes about a theme in the movie is right after Alana reverses the truck downhill. She's sitting on a sidewalk away from Gary and the other 15 year olds, you see them off in the distance, being well, 15 year old. Then along comes Peters. She's hoping he doesn't see her, then he gets distracted by other women. She looks at him as he walks off. 

She enjoys the attention she gets from Peters, Holden, politician guy, but knows she means nothing to them. She's just something to pass the time to them. Then there's this kid she both loathes and enjoys attention from, but he's 15, and isn't as mature as he thinks he is. 

Tension. And specifically relational tension. There isn't a single relationship in this movie that is without tension. On its face the movie seems light hearted, but it's dealing with heavy from the gate. And men and the way they interact with women play a prominent role in that heaviness",ro10uh
i1oun66,"Every reason to like this movie is a distraction to get you to accept this relationship. And it's not only illegal, it's illogical within its own context. Could've been avoided, or addressed in an honest way. The filmmakers chose not to.

This is a really disingenuous and dishonest film. First of all, the premise that any 15 yo would act with the full charisma, and command the almost Mob boss-level respect that Gary does in this film, is laughable. All of the characters are annoying. There's no one to root for. Gary is literally an asshole psychopath who fucks with people and damages property for no reason. His success is never explained. Everybody acts in a cutesy way, which is how the film attempts to legitimize an unacceptable age gap. It's frankly embarrassing, knowing what we know about Hollywood.

Endless shots suggest, highlight and italicize how bad Alana and Gary both want to bone. The film shows everything BUT them actually consummating, which makes it somehow creepier. Then the movie tries to have its cake and eat it too by being like ""Look, this 15 yo has MORALS"". Bullshit.

And the title, ""Pizza""? Dude, that's literally pedo code. And the MAIN character is a pedo. That's a fact. And this film ROMANTICIZES it. That is a fact. So I'm supposed to like it 'cause it has good aesthetics? Fuck off.

Not counting the problematic aspects [the age gap between the main characters and the faux-Asian accent part] since I think that’s been discussed enough, it just felt like there was too much crammed into this movie. They had enough random events that they could’ve made this into a short miniseries or something. I usually prefer more character-driven fare, but it felt like they were meandering for too long without a strict plot [which might’ve been the point, but if so, the runtime was too long for that]. Certainly there were good parts [the appearance of the film certainly made it feel period-accurate], but I felt a little disappointed after finishing it. I will admit that I saw a late showing so my fatigue was probably playing a part in things, but I think my attention was flagging even in the middle of the film.

hq3j1az,"I'll just say this: Ever see Charlie Chaplin's ""Limelight""? It centered on a older-man/younger-woman relationship with a considerably wider age gap--but what is galling about it today (especially knowing Chaplin's lifelong proclivity for teenage girls) is the self-aggrandizing way in which Chaplin treats the romance as ""tragic"", as the girl in ""hopelessly in love"" with Chaplin's character is overtly aware of the likelihood that she will outlive the ""love of her life."" Yuck.

The relationship at the center of ""Licorice Pizza"" is a bit more organic. I would like to see the movie a couple more times so I can be better prepared to reach a conclusion about the various ebbs and flows of that relationship, but I am willing to say that, unlike Chaplin, PTA is not portraying this relationship in a manner wholly intended to justify such age-gaps in relationships, or to encourage audiences to rethink those relationships.

While Anderson's characters might be judged by other Anderson characters within the four corners of the screen, I don't think Anderson necessarily judges his characters, or tried to manipulate the audience into viewing them in a particular way. In short, I can understand why people might have negative reactions to either of both of these characters (Alana and Gary) and/or their relationship--because Anderson (to his credit) allows his audience to reach such conclusions on their own.

I had no idea that it was Philip Seymour Hoffman's son. I prefer to go into a film as blind as possible, letting the director do his job and work his magic.  


What impressed me most was PTA's range as a writer/director. This was filmed as a fairly traditional romcom, in stark contrast to ""There Will be Blood"", which was just EPIC, or ""Magnolia"", which felt like a coke binge brought to screen. I mean, 25% of ""Blood"" required no dialogue to be powerful, much like a Terrence Malick film, whereas ""Magnolia"" drew its strength entirely from the dialogue/monologue of the actors.  


For a musical analogy, what PTA has done would be like an artist recording a great metal album, followed by a rock album, and then a pop album. The breadth of his talent is truly unprecedented.",ro10uh
hwqt3ql,"Licorice Pizza’s most enlightening moments come beyond the fourth wall where it illuminates the generational and racial divide on what makes Americans laugh, particularly older White Americans. Otherwise, Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest film — beautifully shot and well acted — is only a modest accomplishment. In a scene of buffoonery set in the 1970s in the San Fernando Valley in California, an older White character speaks in heavily accented English mocking a Japanese woman, his wife and business partner, seated next to him. I watched Licorice Pizza in a second-run theater in an audience of about 50. They howled in laughter at this scene. They didn’t just laugh a little too loud, they were unabashed in their fits and giggles. Coughing followed laughing. I looked around. The audience was overwhelmingly White and near retirement age. 

In a later scene of similar buffoonery, though cushioned by plot-driven acceptance, an older White woman playing a talent agent, laughs and notes the “very Jewish nose” of Alana, the main character. The audience’s response? Not much. I heard one person gasp. Maybe a chuckle or two. I wondered, briefly, what kind of reaction I would’ve received had I laughed in a hyperbolic manner — but I missed my moment. I didn’t have the timing. And neither does writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson. Interestingly he highlights both jokes twice. The “Engrish” twice and the “Jewish nose” twice. It feels intentional as though to say, See? I’ve balanced both slights with equal screentime. The difference in the audience’s reaction, though, was palpable. They laughed heartily at the Asian jokes and exhorted little at the Jewish jokes. Two Wongs — or, in this case, a Mioko and a Kimiko, the businessman’s second Japanese wife — make a White, and their fellow Whites, tickled. 

Some say it’s meant to highlight the racism of the past, specifically the 70s. Tell it like it was, “honest to that time,” Anderson is quoted in response to the controversy. The problem? In 40 years, the net effect hasn’t changed much for Asians in America. We are sensitive to the plight of many but give little attention to “ching chong, ding dong.” (Did you laugh just then? Yep.)

It’s clear by the response of the audience that racism persists in insidious ways. Racism toward Asians is often dismissed in American society. It’s seen as a lesser racism, a lesser violation, and therefore not worth deliberation. It’s not about intent, however, it’s about impact. I’ve personally been told the racism I’ve endured is not really racism — this from a White progressive friend who causally has never lived outside of a narrow monoculture. I wonder when these tropes will end? Comedy is brilliant when it’s new and insightful. Anderson has the wit and skills to do better. These jokes, however, are the same, tired, decades-long punchlines as has existed since the dawn of Hollywood from Fu Manchu and Charlie Chan, Breakfast at Tiffany’s through Sixteen Candles and Lost in Translation. In the near future I suspect these films will, rightfully, carry warnings of “outdated cultural depictions” — nonsequiturs of our time. 

Licorice Pizza rejoices in the nostalgic golden years of the 70s. Thankfully they are setting behind us.

Edit: Sixteen Candles not Pretty in Pink.",ro10uh
i0ms278,"I didn’t particularly like this movie. I didn’t have a super issue with the relationship but it was distracting and overall you always hear about these stories of art imitating life and a few years down the road you find out the director/actor actually ended up being a huge creep. I don’t think Hollywood needed a film like this at this current time, especially with absolutely zero consequences and a Hollywood happy ending. Maybe there is more if you really want to dissect it, but I honestly think most people are going to take away from this film what is mostly presented. A slacker late 20s early 30 year old girl having a romantic relationship with a 15 year old, regardless of “why”, I’m not sure that needed to be told right now.

All these weird and creepy adult men and then this 15 year old who seems to tick all the boxes she’s interested in. Like PTA what is you doing? Being PTA nobody is going to question his decisions but I honestly think this movie doesn’t even super have a purpose for existing if ultimately we’re leaving the audience on a 30 year old and 15 year old hook up note; and the simple fact that if she was a man and he was a young girl this would be absolutely destroyed should definitely be in the conversation.

Of course there’s a story about stunted growth and loss youth and whatnot and the joy and innocence of being a child vs the adult world. But the entire movie hangs in this romantic relationship, which to me I was hoping to god they would be able to finesse it into something else; they didn’t",ro10uh
hqk7i1i,"I think PTA was very smart in casting the 2 main actors that were the same ages as the characters in the film. It helps cement that these 2 characters can never have a romantic relationship as there is no way for the actual actors to be sexually attracted to each other (well maybe Cooper/Gary because he's 16 but definitely not on Alana's side). The result is you get the feeling of a plutonic friendship between an older woman and a kid.    
  
Imagine if instead of Cooper PTA cast an adult playing a teenager. I could definitely see that sending a bad message and the actors could have real sexual chemistry. PTA even kind of plays on that when Alana brings home Gary's older, more handsome co-star.
  
The people who see the relationship as controversial must have sex on the mind and don't believe kids and adults can have real friendship.",ro10uh
hqmz7r8,"I like Anderson, but he doesn't have it in him to make anything better than *Magnolia*.  Given how horrendous this year has been for movies, I was pinning my hopes on this to salvage it.  I'd say that it's probably the ""best"" 2021 movie I've viewed, but that's not saying a ton.  I think I'm being charitable in calling it the best because it seems like it should be.

The highlights are Hoffman and Haim's performances.  Of course Hoffman has acting in his blood, but Haim just came out of music.  Both are so totally natural and engaging on screen, like they've been doing it for years, like Lady Gaga in her two movies.  

I won't mention the age gap since that seems to have gotten the most talk.  What's equally odd is how he starts two businesses at 15.  I guess what I liked about it is how casual it is, not trying too hard to force a plot down your throat.  Some scenes and threads work better than others (the Jack Holden motorcycle thing didn't quite work).  The ending also was really weak and inappropriate and contained a flashback that shocked me with how it went against the naturalistic feel.  The movie also has a few *too* many older songs; it's coming from the Scorsese/Tarantino Method which dictates that playing an older song is done to prop up weak filmmaking because nostalgia for it can cloud problems.

hqc5i9m,"This comment will probably be covered up quickly, but I just finished the movie and I had a thought/theory about it. I get that it's getting some flack because the leads are very age disparate, but I wondered if that wasn't more vague than it seemed to be? I think that maybe they weren't intended to have such a large age gap. Specifically, a scene that stood out to me was when Gary and Alana are in the truck with Jon Peters, and he asks her how old she is. She kind of stutters, first saying that she's 20, then correcting herself that she's 25. Also, she references that she's the youngest of her siblings as well, and if she's in her earlier twenties, it makes her sister's somewhere in their twenties as well. I don't know, it just seems more palatable/believable that three sisters ranging somewhere in their twenties (in the early seventies) would still live with their parents, as opposed to three sister's, who might range from mid- to late-twenties or even thirties would still be at home? 

It seems to me, that it's not to big of a stretch to think she was lying to Gary about her age the entire movie. She tells him her age early on, and I can't help but think that maybe it was a lie she was maintaining? Now, I'm not saying that most, or even many, early twenty year olds would be hanging out with a 15-16 year old, but it would definitely change how the relationship is viewed. I wasn't around during the time period of the movie, but I recall even when I was younger, we didn't go around trumpeting our age to everyone. In the pre-digital age, it didn't matter as much if one person was early twenties, and one was late teens. We hung out with people who were in an age range. As long as we were working and out of high school, it just didn't come up as much. And I'm not saying it was ever okay for twenty-something to date a 15 year old, but a 20-21 year old and an 17-18 year old? That definitely happened, and I could see similar stuff occurring in the seventies. Jeez, it wasn't uncommon for 16-17 year olds to get married back then.",ro10uh

The acting was fantastic, but overall I felt like the narrative arc was unsatisfying. The first half of the movie was fun, funny and well pieced together. The second half sort of dragged along and felt like there were several scenes that sort of built up to nothing, like the Sean Penn dinner scene and the business with Bradley Cooper (really funny stuff but narratively, felt like a whole lot for us to arrive at Alana wanting to be in politics…??). The political piece felt like it went by quickly as well and by the time that was done the movie was over. Overall the movie is a pretty easy watch with relatable themes but I can’t say I’m in a rush to watch it again.

It was a hell of a lot better than Inherent Vice but a tier or two below There Will Be Blood, Boogie Nights and Punch Drunk Love for me",ro10uh

Also, watch for the creepy dude on the pinball machine too, pedophilia is all over this movie. 

Side note no offense to Cooper Hoffman, but I can’t imagine he sniffs an audition for this role let alone the lead actor of an Oscar nominated film, if it wasn’t for the fact his Dad is a legend in the industry.

hy2jv9p,"Joel Wachs and Jon Peters are real people who are still alive. Both of them have probably seen this movie. I wonder what they think about it. 

I love Paul Thomas Anderson's casts, man. They put the ones his brother Wes puts together to shame. I'll make a movie star out of that kid from the girl group I used to work with. If Phillip Seymour Hoffman isn't available, by golly we'll raise him from the dead. John C Reilly must be heard, if not really seen. Also, I think between this and all his other films we could complete a full map of the San Fernando Valley.

I'm not good at telling people's ages, at all. Part of it is that high schoolers are routinely played by actors in their late 20s. Until that cameraman smacked her ass I didn't know Alana was supposed to be an adult. I was like *oh shit that's a creepy pedophile*--oh, never mind, it's just regular casual groping.

The Japanese-obsessed dude was funny every goddamn time. 

If his penis looks ""normal,"" doesn't that mean that circumcision *doesn't* automatically make you Jewish? Most American dudes at the time were circumcised, Jewish or not. We all knew that kid in high school who had to make a huge fuckin point out of being an atheist and pissing off religious people out of some conviction to his not-God. Personally, if I were an atheist, I'd lie my ass off to get in good with the parents. Who's gonna find out and punish me? 

I'm not as disturbed about the film's couple straddling the age of consent as some other people. Like, whatever, it's a weird comedy, it can go dark if it wants to. My concern is more with how it's juxtaposed against Joel Wach's relationship at the end. I know it's probably not intended this way, but it kinda seems like Alana's thinking ""If he can date men, why can't I date a teenager?"" Unfortunately, this wasn't an uncommon attitude among pedophiles at the time, and it was very detrimental to gay acceptance that they were associated together. In representing a historical time period, I don't think this movie could come out and say ""homosexuality is OK, pedophilia is not"" without it feeling really clunky and forced. It's not a big problem, but it's a bit uneasy.",ro10uh

How calm they are as they drop down the hill was actually pretty cool and realistic.

They always drove second hand cars and planned poorly for every vacation but were both excellent drivers and could get pretty far on fumes and a flat tire.

The relationship is problematic. Why nobody at all questions anything about it is bizarre.

I feel Hollywood currently has an obsession with problematic relationships and that viewers tend to pass it off as charming or delightful.

I can see where you're coming from, and I can also get the vibe from her character that she often takes on the opinion and world view of whichever person she speaks with last.

ija8eu1,"I completely agree. It's not just the age gap. Typically girls at that age are already more mature than a guy the same age. So we have Gary who is a typical idiotic horned up 15 year old with a girl ten years older. Even if she isn't mature for her age, she is still going to be much older and more mature than a 15 year old guy. There is no way she would be attracted to him in any way unless she had some sort of mental or emotional issue. She witnesses Gary act like an immature idiot so many times.

i2a7see,I would disagree. If they are both 19 that effectively destroys the entire point of the movie.,ro10uh
hpzrebr,"Alana has a pretty interesting arc IMO.  Copying most of this from my comment elsewhere in this thread, but:

It seems like Alana is stuck in a rut and struggling with adulthood, and hanging out with Gary is a way for her to reclaim that youthful, carefree feeling that she no longer has. But she's clearly torn about it. Throughout the movie, she questions why she's hanging out with Gary and his friends instead of growing up. After the running out of gas sequence, she seems fed up with how immature Gary is and wants to make a change. She starts working in Sachs' office, and her relationship with Gary changes noticeably - she starts getting annoyed at him for messing up tasks and for not thinking about the bigger picture beyond himself and his friends. This continues up until the scene where Sachs invites her for a drink, only to reveal that she is being used as a cover. Once Alana is reminded of how bleak and horrible the adult world can be, her first reaction is to go find Gary again.

A lot of his characters and movies are actually like this Daniel Plainview (There Will Be Blood) didn't change or grow, Freddie Quell and Lancaster Dodd (The Master) too etc.

I think it's an interesting thing to do because our whole lives we've been beaten over our heads with the ""there must be change and growth"" schtick. And with a lot of his movies he creates these characters that just kinda exist. It's boring for sure, but it's also just as fascinating to watch once we stop expecting so much from characters.

He lets you just kinda sit with a character you know? And witness them as they are, not as we want them to be, not as they are ""supposed"" to be.

I think I learned it from watching There Will Be Blood, then Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, those movies kind of introduced me to movies which don't necessarily have a plot but have characters who are just as interesting as a plot line. I watched The Master after that and most of PTA's movies and got what he's doing. It's an interesting movie experience.",ro10uh

I think it ads a couple things.  First, it's a foil to get to see Hoffman's and Haim's reaction to each other in the scene.  Second, it's a continuation of Haim's using men around her to force her push into some kind of more mature existence.

And thematically, in a movie about age and growth or lack thereof, you have two venerable Hollywood insiders of a definite former generation persuasion reliving their golden years.  Further, a lot of the relationships in the movie (or at least Haim and Hoff), are functioning to try to define who they are.  Sean Penn keeps saying 'you remind me of Grace,' seeing right through the woman in front of him, and after the third time Haim questions him, though unheard, 'do you even remember my name?'",ro10uh

There are some weird tonal shifts and pacing concerns throughout. Many scenes probably should’ve been omitted altogether.

You know what Gary was doing two years ago? Being 13!

I don't see why they couldn't have at least made him 18. The ""we're in different places in life and at different maturities"" thing would still apply. For a second I thought that maybe three years have passed when we hear Alana say she's 28, but the film is described as the events of one summer.

I see how the scene could be seen as that but I see it differently. When Alana is confronted about the realities of being gay that is her loss of innocence and there is no going back. I see last scene as one last joke about Hollywood (the whole movie is really making fun of L.A.). Alana has been wanting to get into the movies and she finally gets that Hollywood ending.

Despite the kiss, I definitely don't think Paul Thomas Anderson intended for the audience to view Alana and Gary's relationship as a healthy, positive thing that was gonna last. Alana is incredibly immature for her age, and Gary thinks he's more mature than he actually is. The time that they spent with each other only happened because Gary was a way for Alana to hold on to her teenage years before she needs to finally leave it behind and approach adulthood like a normal person, and because Alana was an older woman who made Gary feel more grown-up than he really is. The two of them will probably forget about each other in the future (like Alana said they would), and that's frankly for the best.

The movie *is* about her, which is one of the most pleasant surprises to me. Obviously Gary is also a main character but we spend a fair bit of time on Alana in particular. Notice how in the Safdie dinner scene the camera doesn't even focus on either of the male characters as it's revealed what's going on. That scene isn't *about* the fear gay people lived with in the '70s, it's there to show how Alana has found herself in another romantic endeavor that left her embarrassed and unsatisfied, which sends her running back to Gary.",ro10uh

hpw6yv9,"Your reading of the film seems to be super charged with a cynicism that PTA does not seem to share at all, either in any of his interviews or the way he makes his movies. He tends to withhold judgement from his characters. It doesn’t mean you don’t make strong points, but Joel Wachs isn’t a cold hearted character — you’re assuming the film agrees with his boyfriend’s anger at him. Wachs seems to be a sincere politician who wants to make a change, but his bleak assessment about the 1973 world they live in is 100% correct. 

I wrote a big post on the PTA sub on my takes on the relationship. As in Phantom Thread, PTA isn’t endorsing poisoning your partner as a means of making a relationship work… it’s an embellishment and allegory about what it takes to make a relationship work. 

To me, this film is about how Alana’s relationship with Gary is both arrested development and an allegory for hanging onto childhood. She consistently tries to enter the world of adulthood, only to repeatedly battered and disillusioned by it. She never really shows any sexual attraction to Gary — that’s all pressed on by him.",ro10uh
hpwg3zo,"This is a very misguided reading of the movie, especially if you consider every other movie that PTA has ever done.

hpvp3r0,Would you not consider Safdie's character a positive character? He's a seemingly honest politician. He gives up his love life for his career which he believes is for the betterment of society. He gave those around him hope. I didn't see much to dislike about him.,ro10uh
hpw6815,"And for all the other differences in how the adult men are portrayed, their one commonality is exploiting the sexuality of women for advancing themselves. Cooper’s character waves around the fact that he’s the hairdresser of Barbara Streisand. Penn’s uses Alana as a nameless stand-in for Grace Kelly to provide the ride look for his motorcycle stunt. Higgins’s uses his wives to provide bona fides for his Japanese restaurant (while hiring white women as waitresses to keep things from getting too unfamiliar for his white customers). Safdie’s uses her to keep his sexuality hidden. And there’s the waterbed salesman using a Black woman making bedroom eyes to sell merchandise.

By the time I realized this was a main thread of the movie, it was too late for me to get a full sense of where Gary fits into this, I’m going to keep a closer eye on this when I watch it again in the next week or so. In some ways, he’s comfortable exploiting the sexuality of women just like the adults, hiring a pin-up girl to pose on his waterbed at the expo and asking Alana to dial up the sex when talking about the beds on the phone. But to me there’s more going on when he’s upset about Alana willing to go topless than just petulance over his not getting to see her topless; he knows from his time in show business how she’d be exploited and doesn’t want that for her. He gets uneasy when she goes off-script and basically sets up a porn plot to sell a bed. And there’s also the decidedly juvenile moment of him and his buddies playing with the phallic gas can.

That juvenile moment is what sets up the final movement of the film, with the poster for Wachs presenting itself as an alternative to Gary. It’s a chance to invest herself in things that are important, but also in things that are mature, more suitable for someone her age. The hope of that moment getting snuffed out by him asking her to play beard for his boyfriend is what sends her over the edge. She feels - I think accurately - that Gary cares about her in ways that the adults do not, hence the flashback to him running to her after the motorcycle jump and everyone else leaving her behind. She no longer wants to deal with the painful world of adults who don’t give a shit about other people, while choosing to ignore that by crossing the line and pursuing a relationship with Gary she is joining that club.

It really feels like willful ignorance when so many of the reviews paint it as an easy-breezy nostalgia trip. There’s so much happening in this movie beneath the surface; I immediately wanted to rewatch Dune to experience the spectacle once more, but with Licorice Pizza I wanted to keep rewinding the projector so I could think about it more.

(And just to touch on the other controversial element - I think PTA overestimated his audience with how he had Higgins’s character behave. It’s clear as day to me that his racism isn’t meant to be seen as a joke, but even on opening day in NYC the crowd laughed as hard at his “accent” as at any of the jokes in the movie. It seems like he believed his audience was good enough to see those moments for what they actually were - a racist man behaving as a racist man would - and was proven wrong.)",ro10uh
hpy2coo,"Like Love in the Time of Cholera. People talk and think about it like it’s a dreamy romance. The main character has pedophilic relationships. Love is compared to a drug throughout the book. Marquez says that it’s an intentionally easy book to misread, which is part of its genius.

PTA does something similar here, not only with their relationship, but with the hollowness of the characters. I thought it captured a certain type of Southern Californian flightiness very well. These are people who jump from charismatic huckster and scheme to charismatic huckster and scheme in pursuit of meaning.

Their whole relationship is very fantastical and I don’t really take it literally.

The adults are gray, and flawed, just like real life.",ro10uh
hpxobox,"Really glad to see this comment. I felt this way but even stronger; to me, this film is 2.5/5. 

An interesting thing that no one has pointed out is that none of the characters go through complete arcs: everyone just keeps doing what they're doing in the end and nobody learns a thing. Gary keeps hustling while pursuing a fantasy love. Alana never makes anything out of herself and just settles. The rest of the characters follow their own patterns. I don't know who to root for here. ""Love?"" Idk, a will-they-won't-they love story is not really a strong plot point by itself.

Which leads me to my second point: this movie doesn't really have a plot. It's pretty much: ""a bunch of things happen, no one learns anything and just succumbs. Men win while women settle.""

Didn't love all the tropes. The racism felt super forced and unnecessary. The blatant misogyny was not charming or funny. It makes me wonder, what is this movie trying to say? Is it a slice of life satire of the 70's in California? That's fine, but is that really a movie we need right now? 

Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate it. The acting was good, and I do like the music and cinematography. The use of reflections were really cool. But I really, *really* don't understand the 10/10s this movie is getting. Is it better than Phantom Thread? Boogie Nights? TWBB? Absolutely the fuck not. This movie is very mid-tier from a master, and I expected more.

Edit for grammar.",ro10uh
hpvw1xf,"If you listen to much of the praise, the critics aren't really saying anything of substance. 

They're just going through the motions and offering blind adoration for the central relationship. Merely because the characters justify something to themselves doesn't mean that reviewers have to fall in line, too. 

More insidiously, however, I have noticed an eerie strand of emotional blackmail operating in some of the reviews - critics seem to suggest if you don't buy into its romantic treatment of an abusive and unhealthy relationship, then you're too ""square"" to appreciate cinema.

Peter Bradshaw's review celebrated the central relationship as ""transgressive"" and dismissed concerns as ""21st century gender politics"". For his part, Mark Kermode simply proclaims ""it's whatever you think it is"".

What a cop-out.

While I appreciate your willingness to go further than most critics, I must disagree in your assessment that the film dissects the relationship. If you look at ""Punch Drunk Love"" or ""Phantom Thread"", there's a pattern in his work of constantly trying to romanticize the inner lives of abusive characters. 

It's difficult not to remember the stories of abuse regarding Fiona Apple and see some his filmmaking as self-justification. Like ""Punch Drunk Love"" or ""Phantom Thread"", we're supposed to buy into the sincerity of the connection and - in spite of the abuse - be charmed by the ""taboo"" relationship presented to us.",ro10uh
hpvpg88,"I agree that the age difference makes it weird, but I think it was necessary for this story. Gary is young enough to still have this optimism and energy for life that Alana has lost in her twenties. I kind of think it makes sense that she would want to be around that when the rest of her life is unsatisfying. At the same time, as you said, Gary is still an asshole but he's one among a billion assholes. He at least gives her something she feels is missing in her life.",ro10uh
hq4jmr0,">He's pointing out a major problem to you, right in your face

I couldn't agree more. They keep mentioning that Gary is 15. It would have been weird for us the audience if it wasn't constantly mentioned. Alana knows that its very weird to be friends and business partners with a child, but still flirts with the idea of a romantic relationship throughout the film and ultimately embraces it.  Its all part of the full portrait of LA in 1973. Racism against two Japanese women (to the extent that the first is literally replaced by the second) is casual and callous. BECAUSE IT WAS. Teenagers did date grown adults in 1973, and racism was open and ""not a big deal"", because it was. The film is not suggesting that this is ""good"", but it was the truth.

But more to the point, the entire film is so obviously about the relationship between children and adults (whether its straight up sexual or just seeing the ""commodity"" of cute, adorable child actors) as being completely unhealthy. I would go so far as to call it a MeToo film. Even Alana's audition with Holden seems oddly manipulative and her character in the audition is somewhat infantile, and Holden can only remember her characters name. Lucille Ball can't tolerate the once cute and adorable Gary after the young man tells a dirty, adult joke. 

This is a dark film that tackles a very serious problem of children (specifically in Hollywood) being immersed in the adult world of sex, politics and business that they are most certainly not ready to be a part of. But its presented in the genre of the romcom. Maybe because that's how the characters see it, because ""its not that big of a deal, everyone does it"". I think Gary is a victim. He's a very sexualized 15 year old who may appear ""mature for his age"", but in reality he's a failure who knows how to ""play the part"" of the suave pickup artist. I'm on the fence about my opinion of Alana, I need to see it again.",ro10uh
hqpruw6,"I like your take on the film and I agree that PTA would most likely not make a film claiming statutory rape is fine, but I think he really fell short in making that point apparent. There is not a single moment in the film where he tries to make you feel like it's wrong or something we should frown upon (besides the characters mentioning their ages). It is almost the complete opposite the entire way through, even to the romantic exclamation point of an ending. I think this is where his filmmaking failed. It never feels like satire; it feels like something to be celebrated and that's the problem. It doesn't matter if you are disgusted by the relationship throughout the film because it is entirely and wholly bathed in a positive light from start to finish, regardless of the ups and downs. It ends up just feeling really weird and creepy and I believe this is the fault of his writing and the cinematography.

It honestly pains me to say this because most of his previous works are masterclasses in writing, directing, and acting. Licorice Pizza just really failed to hit the mark for me and although I appreciate your viewpoint, I really don't think the filmmaking says what you think it's saying. The film should speak for itself but a couple moments of exposition don't excuse or replace how it's portrayed. The ingredients are there but for some reason they didn't mix well. ",ro10uh

I just don't see how it's any different with characters like the Joker or Hans Landa. Real life means humans are incredibly flawed and things are never just black and white.

Whereas Once Upon a Time had zero acknowledgment of any of it. PTA wouldn’t even use the radio the way Tarantino did, instead we got that surreal, abstract soundscape of the car radio while Gary and his mom were eating burgers.

This is why PTA is my favorite filmmaker, he doesn’t judge anything or anyone, but he wants to tell the truth and reality of every situation and leave it up to the audience to decide.

It sucks seeing some responses to the film and the lack of film or storytelling literacy.",ro10uh
hqael1z,"I also felt like this was his throwback hangout film. Not necessarily in competition or dialogue with Quentin, but both masterclass filmmakers that are comfortable in there careers and just wanted to ""vibe"" in this world. Both films are perfect to have on in the background while you clean and I mean that as a very high compliment. Kinda like Goodfellas in that it's episodic and a joy all the way. 
I rather enjoyed the Sean Penn/Tom Waits bit. All the actor's were wonderful, shout out to Safdie who always seemed a little false and aloof, perfect for a politician who's in the closet lol.
The Mr.Frick and his Japanese wives parts were weird and I wasn't sure how to respond to that. Were we supposed to laugh at him, with him, at the situation? Idk.
And the age difference thing didn't bother me because it's not real life, it's a movie and I just took it for what it was..Right or wrong it was the characters decision to be together and they're both flawed people.

It was one of the best looking movies I've seen in a while, I'll give him that but everything else was off. 

 PTA has been the master of the slow build and scenes bubbling over with suspense or drama but this movie was like almost the opposite.  PTA built up huge scenes only for them to fizzle when they're supposed to explode.  Bradley Coopers whole scene is a perfect example of how we were finally building to a good scene only for it to end abruptly with zero drama.

I think the *intent* of that guy's character is to also show that he is using Asian women as an extension of his self worth by including them in his restaurant.

>I think it would be a mistake to tell a period film through the eyes of 2021. You can’t have a crystal ball, you have to be honest to that time. Not that it wouldn’t happen right now, by the way. My mother-in-law’s Japanese and my father-in-law is white, so seeing people speak English to her with a Japanese accent is something that happens all the time. I don’t think they even know they’re doing it.

I appreciate that PTA intended to portray the racism against the Japanese women as the guy being stupid and wrong, but when the only scenes with Asians in the movie are where they are the butt of a character's racist joke, it doesn't work the way it should. The movie showed that Alana had to put up with sexual assault at work (the handsy photographer at the beginning of the movie) and a woman making a snide remark about her ""very Jewish nose."" But it works on her case because Alana is a fully-formed, humanized character outside of the BS she and many other women at the time had to deal with on a daily basis. 

While I appreciate that PTA *intended* to depict the racism against the Japanese women as being stupid and wrong, it would've worked better if the Japanese characters weren't *just* there to show how racist the 70s were towards Asians.

I was thinking about this after watching the movie. It felt like a movie about a moment in two flawed peoples' lives where they orbited around each other until they finally collided. We're given shockingly little time before the film's introduction and their first encounter and the movie ends almost immediately after their kiss. By the end of the movie they both have clear, age-appropriate potential partners ""in the wings"". That said, I don't think the movie was intended to make the audience feel as uncomfortable as it evidently made a lot of people feel - from the outside in, through a cold plot description or the lens of the past as the characters move on, the reality of the situation is clear. Alana herself acknowledged how weird it was at multiple points in the movie.

I think the whole “arrest” thing was meant to leave us confused in the moment and be a bit of comic relief.  But I think we are supposed to initially believe Gary is being arrested for trying to score and sell weed with his waterbeds, but as it plays out we find out he was picked up fitting the description of a murder suspect.

Bradley's character was based on a real guy who has some crazy stories told about him [https://kevin-smith.fandom.com/wiki/Superman\_Lives](https://kevin-smith.fandom.com/wiki/Superman_Lives)

I honestly felt the age difference was the least strange thing about this movie. I had a harder time wrapping my head around 15 year olds selling water beds. It kind of made sense that Alana was really immature, but her family all live together as if they're still kids and she was the youngest. Needed more tension with the strict parents. I think if her sisters were shown to be married with kids and she was 28/29 (Haim's real age) and Gary 18/19 (Hoffman’s real age) the age difference would be there, but less illegal, and more plausible that Gary would be running businesses.

Almost everyone felt like part of a surreal fever dream, and I expected at some point for it to be revealed that Gary was either fantasizing about all this or writing a movie based (loosely) on his own life, leaving it ambiguous as to what was real or not. The scene where he walks into the water bed store and everyone working there is really weird. Then suddenly he's selling them. Only once does Alana ask Sean Penn ""is this real or lines?"" when he's being really bizarre, and absolutely nobody else bats an eye to him and Tom Waits. I know it's Hollywood but the whole thing was borderline nonsensical.",ro10uh

hq8o39q,">As for the racist parts, PTA said something that only few directors say. Why are you going to make a time period based film and not protray the truth of the time period.

For me it wasn't the fact that racial humor was included, it was moreso the lack of effort put into it. Like, it's 2021, I think that most of the general audience who is going out of their way to see this movie understands that racial stereotypes and racism in general were commonly accepted in the 1970s; we don't need a cheap, low effort bit to tell us that. 

The way it was approached here has been done countless times. A shitty horrendous accent is the type of humor I'd expect from a youtube or tiktok sketch, much less a movie that wants to present itself as clever as this one. 

It was good for one laugh, but if you're not going to develop that humor any further, stop going back to it. If you want to do racial humor, put some actual thought and effort into it. The green card-seeking, token-wife asian characters served as nothing more than mere vessels to carry out the low hanging fruit jokes, all so the audience can easily point and laugh at how stupid the racist white guy looks. It's the type of shitty joke you'd hear at your high school lunch table. 

It's almost akin to toilet humor in a movie imo. Don't hit us with the same fart joke we've all heard our dad tell a million times. Do it creatively and thoughtfully, or don't do it at all.",ro10uh

Throughout LP Alana is shown to be immature, and more importantly, unable to move into the adult world. Each person she uses to ""move up"" either is pretty mean, uses her, or just does not care about her. 

The actor played by Sean Penn is obsessed with his own roles and his fame. 

The politician she works for uses her to hide his own relationship. His boyfriend also shows how tough it is to find someone who loves you and appreciates you. 

Bradley Cooper's character is another ego filled maniac obsessed with getting laid and himself. 

Speaking figuratively, Gary represents a much more simple and innocent way of life. But Gary also represents immaturity, shown by the fact that he doesn't pay attention to the news and just pays attention to what's in front of him.

Bradley Cooper as Jon Peters is the slick, rich Hollywood playboy with the celebrity girlfriend and swinging lifestyle.

The Penn character to me is like an aging throwback ""macho"" leading man who's clearly stuck in the glory years, trying to recapture some lost magic of yesteryear. He's also utterly self-absorbed, to the extent where she might as well not be present in her scenes with him. He's the old Hollywood archetype of masculinity. 

The Safdie Brother is a takedown of fake virtue, principle, and integrity. On the surface, a paragon of virtue. As we see later, it's all for show.

I didn't LOVE the movie, but I did like how they introduced all these cool/admirable men and then obliterated them. Like the saying goes, ""Never meet your heroes.""

Like I said, I think both characters get something from each other that they feel is missing in themselves, but it's not like she's not genuinely interested in Gary as a person.  I don't see that ""user"" characterization as applying to her relationship with Lance either- she just seemed to genuinely be charmed by him and attracted to him and went out with him for that reason, not because she was ""using"" him in any way.  

The only time she really comes across as ""using"" someone for her own gain rather than out of a genuine interest or attraction is Sean Penn's character, but it seemed like she wasn't just using him for her own self-advancement like you implied - she also wanted to make Gary jealous.

hvwousv,"Exactly. I've had so many bad faith discussions with people where they insist that the film depicts it critically without endorsing it. In the text there's literally nothing that makes us question the main characters' intentions.

In Red Rocket (another acclaimed film in which an adult man pursues a relationship with a teenager [who is technically 19 but the power dynamic is similar]), the film goes to great lengths to show us how awful he is and how many people he encounters who think negatively of him. The film clearly communicates to us that he is an antihero and we're supposed to be critical of him. In Licorice Pizza we're so attached to Alana and so locked in to her experience that we can only ever view her as in the right. I think RR portrays without endorsing because of the more objective lens through which we see the protagonist, but LP is so subjectively locked into Alana's view that it really comes off as uncritical.",ro10uh

Hollywood definitely enjoys depicting problematic relationships, and on its own I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. It’s *how* they’re depicted thats the issue. I didn’t feel like this movie was critical at all of the age gap, if anything it made it out to be an obstacle Alana had to overcome.",ro10uh

What I do know is PTA made a quirky indie rom com with a 99% white cast where all POC are treated as comedic fodder or a trope, in some sort of attempt to satirize the 70s but ultimately a 30 year old gets into a relationship with a child.

(Through Gisondo, Penn, Cooper and Safdie)

Also, it seems that people are honing to much on the “relationship” aspect of the movie and the age discrepancy of the leads, but really it’s all just metaphorically about Alana’s struggle with not knowing what to do with her life and finally deciding that she doesn’t need to “act” a certain way or age anymore, she can just be herself.",ro10uh

hxxr27y,"To be clear, I do not condone almost *anything* about this movie. But:

>someone as well versed in film making as PTA could find ways to humanize the wives

The first wife was humanized brilliantly, IMO, when Gary’s mom reads that part in the advertisement where she calls the waitresses dolls and makes a reference to how small they are. The wife’s expression changes instantly but relatively subtly the second those words leave Gary’s mom’s mouth. She goes from politely listening and clearly enjoying the description of her business to completely flat and emotionless in an instant. It was a *very* human moment. There’s also the fact that he has a new Japanese wife later on in the movie, which paints him as a gross race fetishist on top of being a racist, and implies that she may have left him. She definitely didn’t appear to enjoy his accent when he did it for her.

These two just spent at least 3 months hanging out together all the time, she’s like his biggest ever crush and to her, he’s the charming lil young dude batting way out of his league.

  
They go through so much together throughout the course of the film… the arrest sequence, the Bradley Cooper hijinks, chaperoning him in New York, starting a business together, Sean Penn drops her off his bike.

Alana and Gary's ""relationship"" is one that, from a moral standpoint, should never have happened. And it's up to the audience to be intelligent/perceptive enough to see past the nostalgic romanticism that Alana and Gary are viewing things with. 

A lot of people romanticize the 70s, but I appreciated that this movie portrayed the less savory parts of that time period, like casual racism against Asians, commonplace sexual harassment, (I'm thinking of the scene in the beginning with the handsy photographer), Benny Safdie's character needing to hide his sexual orientation for the sake of his political career, etc.",ro10uh
hpzvjp3,"If the movie had not ended with a romantic final kiss in a completely straightforwardly positive way, I could maybe see your argument. But as is I think if anything I had the opposite reading from the film. That age ultimately was irrelevant because of the connection they had, or at least that it wasnt an insurmountable hurdle. 

If you look back at all of PTA's depictions of love they are quite fucked up. Punch drunk love is about a truly mentally ill individual finding love in someone who is so lonely that she will accept just about anything. Phantom thread is about a relationship that is so abusive that one partner feels the need to poison the other so as to access his more sensitive side. And both of these movies are still, in many ways, extremely romantic. 

I don't think you can just say that the whole thing is meant to be vilified by the viewer. I think it isn't meant to be a perfect relationship, but it certainly seems to be one that PTA thinks has some value, and that we as viewers should consider.",ro10uh
hpw1k35,"Exactly. It reminds me of Jiang Wen's In the Heat of the Sun which is one of my favourites. That movie is presented as a glamorous, pleasant, dreamlike memory growing up during the Cultural Revolution which is presented as a kind of Neverland.

hr3zlr8,"Completely agree with this. Not to say PTA isn't obviously aware of what a 10-year age gap suggests, just that the *point* of the movie isn't as simple as saying ""stat rape obviously bad."" Audiences can read as much or as little into that aspect as they want, but there's so much more to be gleamed from the ways Gary and Alana find something they need in each other, romantic or not. For Gary especially, that manifests as romantic attachment as he's a teenaged boy getting a ""chance"" with an attractive older woman, whereas for Alana, Gary offers both a youthful zeal and lust for life that her adult contemporaries can't *and* enough adult posturing to reasonably convince her their relationship is normal, even if (as OP pointed out), it's not. 

A long way of saying there are nuances upon nuances and many broader human insights to take from their relationship, which I don't at all think is primarily intended as a ""you fell into my justifying-stat-rape trap!"" gotcha",ro10uh
hqk5fef,"> To me, this film is about how Alana’s relationship with Gary is both arrested development and an allegory for hanging onto childhood. She consistently tries to enter the world of adulthood, only to repeatedly battered and disillusioned by it. She never really shows any sexual attraction to Gary — that’s all pressed on by him.

I think you nailed it and I think PTA made this very obvious in the movie. Anderson could not have hit us over the head more that Alana was the adult and Gary was the kid and they never forget that. Their relationship is playful but not sexual. Of course Gary finds her attractive but he never goes too far (even when the opportunity arose he did not act on it). Alana can be childish and combative and in Gary Alana finds someone she can go toe to toe with while being the one in control because at the end of the day Gary is just a kid.",ro10uh
hpxpadf,"The thing about Phantom Thread than makes it so strong is, they *learn* something about each other and use it to develop their relationship and, ultimately, *change* as characters.

It's obvious in the way Alana talks about her volunteer work that she mostly saw it as a way to prove to herself she was mature and had her shit together.

Hope he can return to form with his next effort, but this was a major dud IMO and felt flat of my immense expectations",ro10uh
hpy5xx6,"I agree with your assessment of the quality of the film. I’d actually say I dislike it more than you. It was very charming and entertaining but I ultimately found it hollow and aesthetically uninteresting. Having said all that….

I disagree with the idea that an audience can ever “need something.” Movies at their best are expressions of what a filmmaker wants to say. A movie that’s set in the 70s is going to have racism and misogyny in it, if it’s at all being honest. Even a movie that’s set in the present day will have it. It’s not the responsibility of a director to smooth those things over.

I think PTA was trying to portray a particular kind of California flightiness. A lot of Californians, those from LA in particular, lack direction, and are moving from huckster and scheme to huckster and scheme to find meaning. And since California has been this symbol of renewal in America for a century, PTA is generalizing that attitude to the rest of the country. Don’t think there aren’t immature women in their mid-20s who’re suckered into dreams of charismatic teenage boys? You’ll find them in Silicon Valley, building vaperware, or in Hollywood, managing vloggers and TikTokers, or in New York, obeying every whim of CEOs of bloated real estate companies masquerading as tech companies. That’s America. And that’s Liqorice Pizza",ro10uh
hpzw9d2,"I'm thinking this is the comment I agree most with here. Yes it's good, fun, well shot, and all that PTA jazz we expect.... but it didn't feel very.... well creative. A person from a marginalized community living in American society sees bad characters like this all day and night and there's nothing unique about slamming them into a movie together.",ro10uh
hpy7v5m,"I think you’re making a huge leap saying that he’s telling on himself. His relationship with apple was 20+ years ago when they were basically piece of shit junkies and they’ve reconciled and he’s happily married with kids now. Phantom Thread was self-criticism of domineering male types being sad little boys if anything and he himself said it was about his current marriage. Just because he plays with the ugliness of people doesn’t mean he’s celebrating it.

Edit: oh wait you’re that freak that keeps posting copypasta-tier rants about how PTA and Scorcese are secret monsters and awful filmmakers. You’re a real fucking weirdo dude, you can dislike someone’s films without thinking it’s a conspiracy that others like them",ro10uh

Has anyone watched films about couples/relationships with weird dynamics? .... particularly age? ....the trope goes back thousands of years and if it makes you feel weird maybe ask someone that lived through the 60s or 70s or any time before that if it was an extremely unacceptable situation, especially surrounding Hollywood and the entertainment industry.

hq27ur0,"To me the movie is ultimately about how people use each other, the entertainment industry being kind of an externalizing of that. Just like Alana is using Gary for her own sense of sexual self worth, and Gary is using her for his own sense of maturity and ego, and Gary's mom is using Gary (Maybe the healthiest relationship in the movie) to get jobs, this guy is using Asian women as part of his own self worth via the restaurant he owns.

It's pretty much Daniel becomes an oilman but there are so many meandering sequences like adopting a deaf kid, the stuff with his ""brother"", and of course, his beef with eli. but even the eli stuff weaves in and out; hes not omnipresent through the movie. 

I'd say Magnolia is the only one with a plot but the whole structure hinges on it being meticulous. Inherent Vice and Phantom Thread are just as freeform",ro10uh
hqcgtna,"Same and it sucks a lot bc I really admire PTA’s films.

hz83cxh,"Yeah, I got the impression that Alana was just kind of using Gary as a means to an end, she gets flirty with every guy she thinks can catapult her to fame and fortune and leaves the previous guy in the dust.

Her ""I love you"" was rather dispassionate and that her relationship with him was meant to be seen as very wrong, and her life choices rather tragic as she keeps going back to making the same juvenile mistakes. Either that or Gary was fantasizing about it all. But PTA is so weird that might not be the case.",ro10uh

hq8w58g,"I was hoping that she would get with the guy at the campaign office that she was bonding with and he would be content with his flings with the teen girls he was popular with, and they'd both grow apart and we'd have a bittersweet ending where they both become more content with where they are in life: Gary realizes that being young is great and to leave his wild business schemes and faux mature airs for when he's older, and Alana grows up and stops looking to men for validation. But instead we got them ending up together in love. Kinda icky. 

I mean I know nowadays we're all so sensitive to anything pedophilic or grooming-related, for good reason, but I don't think that was much of a concern to PTA. He seems to see them as two people at different times in their lives who nevertheless share a deep, earnest bond, society-be-damned. I can kind of appreciate that, tbh. Things were different back then, to a degree. But I still have the initial reaction of ""oh no they kissed, ew."" There's a good story in there about two friends of different ages getting close without all of the sexual tension, and especially without the ending validating their choices. Maybe he meant the ending as a cautionary tale, or as anything but an endorsement (I think many PTA fans are using that defense whenever the age gap thing comes up, and he's certainly a filmmaker with enough nuance to not wear his themes or his meaning on his sleeve and tie everything in a neat little bow) but I don't think the text of the film supports that.",ro10uh

hriwley,">On no planet, in no universe, would that character do that unless he were mentally unbalanced and/or on coke himself. Nor would he destroy the car. Come on! To the contrary, Gary is supposed to be a Hollywood insider and A+ hustler-he’d be kissing Jon’s ass! So what was PTA’s point with that?

Because he's still a kid, he's not quite grown into the A+ hustler he wants to be yet. And initially Alana goes along with it, because she's also immature, but after it's all over she realizes how stupid it all was, and how she's essentially hanging out with kids and diving down to their same level of maturity.",ro10uh
hq9dahm,Definitely agree. PTA is one of those who really delves into the characters in his films. And telling the stories of those characters doesn’t mean he condones their actions.,ro10uh

hrug9ha,"Coming to this late with a likely unnecessary followup, but on further reflection I think I need to clarify - meandering isn't a bad thing. Altman, who is one of PTA's idols, was the king of meandering. But I feel like the payoff of his films makes it worth it - The Long Goodbye has such a phenomenal ending and the film just has a wonderful emotional through line. I wish I could say similar about Licorice Pizza. I just never felt like all the detours ever paid off.",ro10uh

What I think is so alien to people is that this is a movie of nuance that requires nuance to discuss. On paper Alana goes to jail, yeah, obviously, sure.

But this is PTA not Blue’s Clues.

With the whole Jon Peters and the truck episode she recongizes how juvenille Gary and his friend's are, and she has to get serious.

Alana was shown to be trying to latch on to a successful man, and after the failed attempts with the actor and the politician, she realizes that Gary is either probably her best option or she does just want to be friends with him (I'm leaning more towards the first option since she was still reluctant at the end).",ro10uh

hxpxltn,"I think the problem is most people don’t like movies where the ending is left up to interpretation. They want the ending to be very clear and precise. In this film you can argue doesn’t do that although I think that it does.

I think Alana was certainly somebody who was desperate to find direction in her life. Her life was going nowhere. She’s 25 living with her parents. She was working this did in job. All of a sudden this person shows interest in her and he has this confidence and drive that she lacks and I think she’s attracted to that.

As far as the age gap, immediately she tells him that he’s too young and that things will never work out. And I think that’s the issue with this. I think she generally has feelings for him because she appreciates a lot of things about him but at the same time she keeps coming back to the fact that it will never work out. But I think she keeps sticking with him because she wants it too.

Yes the kiss was awkward. Yes when she undressed in front of him it was awkward. But I think within five minutes after the camera rolls, reality would kick in again and she would realize that it’s not going to work out. I mean that’s a continuing theme throughout the film. It’s even when she gets lost and does something she shouldn’t do, she tries to get out of the relationship. I think it’s more or less about two people that need each other but should never be together.

She generally cares about him and that’s that.",ro10uh

> "" Jon Peters, who held the rights to the material dating back to his producing the 1976 blockbuster but had become a pariah due to his behaviour; while the studio made a deal with him for the rights, they made sure his name was not listed in the credits (including the one that were submitted for the Oscar nomination bids that the movie earned), and Bradley Cooper bluntly stated that a major reason his goal of having a happy and respectful set was met was that ""Jon wasn't here.""",ro10uh

Even in their first interaction she's doing that whole side smirk while he compliments her. She loves it, as much as she hates to admit it. I think her relationship with Lance is something similar, but it's moreso that it's a relationship that her family would approve of, which she thinks will make them accept her finally and make her feel more mature...Until she finds out he doesn't identify as Jewish. So that plan has to be abandoned. When she sees Gary making out with that girl, she immediately goes to kiss some random guy because she feels like he's no longer sexually interested in her, and she derives some of her self worth from that. Wachs is, again, someone she feels like she will get a sense of maturity and acceptance from working for. In the scene where she's talking down to Gary and he leaves in a huff, she changes her tone. ""Okay Gary fine I'll take you."" She knows that she needs him for his feelings, more than he needs her, even if she doesn't reciprocate those romantic feelings.",ro10uh

I'm not saying that PTA is a bad person, just that I think maybe he's giving too much leeway in certain actions.

It’s a hangout movie that rides the line of squeamishness, but just because it ends the film on a high note doesn’t mean it’s endorsing a sexual, romantic relationship between the two characters. I don’t think Gary and Alana are going to end up together, but I’m glad we didn’t get some post-script scene that’s like “Alana and I didn’t get married, but we stayed friends and she helped me out when I got my first girlfriend… even though she still got a little jealous from time to time.”

I truly believe that they will never get together, not really, but I *did* believe that there was a strong emotional connection between them. They will not and did not get together this movie because of the age gap - but the connection was undeniable.

If PTA says, a la *Phantom Thread*, that difficult relationships can be overcome through unconventional means, I'm intrigued, because that's deeply relevant to this day and age. If he says, with TWBB, that victory is more satisfying than compassion and that tyranny is more powerful than faith, I'm blown away, because it highlights the state of human affairs that has been true for a very long time. If he tells me, via LP, that the 70's were racist, sexist, etc etc, I say, ""I know. So what?""

That's the difference: having something to *say* is not the same as just... *saying something.*

There's also no beginning or end to him, he's just living in the now. I think most people can relate to that feeling from when they were younger.

hrl5rsp,"this is such a wrong take.  

this is just a popular movie and PTA has one of the single most confusing and unique styles to ever hit the big screen.  He is entirely impartial with characters which is rare, but he ALSO makes the film itself, top down and bottom up, from the perspective of the character.  So if a character feels a certain way about a moment, the film will act that way.  

If an white guy puts on a patronizing, ignorant accent and then gets another token wife and does the same thing... but it’s in another movie, the movie will know this is funny, and will use filmmaking techniques, the reactions of the other characters, and music to convey such.  

But this is the 1970s.  That shit was seen as normal and benign by most people and these characters are no different, so the film also treats it as normal and benign.  The audience is meant to do the heavy lifting and judge whether it’s funny, annoying, racist, etc.  

That kind of impartiality and lack of any actual judgement from characters or direction is literally not done and never has been done in film quite the way PTA does it.  People familiar with his style didn’t see it as racist and knew what he was doing.

A lot of people even today will still do an Asian accent and not think they are being racist. It’s like the director is showing everyone how ridiculous he looks.

I already *agree* with all of this; I acknowledged this in my original comment. I'm not accusing PTA of being a racist or anything like that, I'm just saying that I think it would've been a little clearer that the joke was at the racist guy's expense if *something a little more* was done to humanize the two women he was being racist to. I appreciate his intentions, I just thought his execution could've been a little better. Feel free to disagree with me, but I just felt like laying my thoughts out. 

To expand on my point a little more, Asians haven't historically been depicted well in American films; The few times they show up they usually tend to be nerds, mysterious martial arts masters, or socially awkward weirdos. It just got a little tiring when I saw *Licorice Pizza* repeat the pattern of the Asian characters only being there to be on the receiving end of a guy's weird racist joke, and when the audience in my theater was laughing riotously at that scene, I *hope* they were smart enough to be laughing *at* the guy and not at his mocking accent.

hqrxfr4,"Did you literally not watch any of these scenes? That's WAY more than being friendly. Friendly is being a mentor to high school kids when you're 25 ala Big Brothers Big Sisters where there are clear rules. Maybe you're the cool older cousin or something within your family for younger cousins. But what happens in this movie? Definitely not normal, it's really fucking weird. I really hope that's not something you think is okay in reality. 

A 25 year old deciding to go out for dinner a random 15 year old who hit on her on picture day at school isn't normal. This isn't a small gap nor is the way she interacts with him throughout the movie. Alana feels jealousy as he hits on what looked like a 14 year old during the opening of the water bed store. She goes out of her way to try and make him jealous throughout the film. It's so creepy. 

This film just doesn't work for me and many people for that specific reason. This wasn't a platonic relationship at all, how do you miss literally every cue pointing to the contrary? It's so fucking bizarre to have this conversation.",ro10uh

Her coming back to Gary is her last hurrah and she gets that Hollywood ending. I think people are taking this movie too literally. The thing I don't see a lot of people talking about his how silly this movie is. Like over the top silly. Like Sean Penn riding his motorcycle with flames going lol wut? I think the ending fits right into that. The music swells. They make the lovey dove eyes. They run into each others arms and get that perfect moment kiss. It's so over the top.

>Yes the kiss was awkward. Yes when she undressed in front of him it was awkward. But I think within five minutes after the camera rolls, reality would kick in again and she would realize that it’s not going to work out. I mean that’s a continuing theme throughout the film. It’s even when she gets lost and does something she shouldn’t do, she tries to get out of the relationship. I think it’s more or less about two people that need each other but should never be together.

So I think I liked this more than the detractors in this conversation did but I think if anything the ending pushed an intepretation.

If it'd just have been the kiss, no issues. As you said, it was awkward and that's their relationship. If anything the ""enter room holiding hands, he does something stupid, she gets annoyed, he wins her back"" is neat little microcosm of their relationship and reminds you there's issues here that aren't resolved.

It was the warmly shot, ""I love you"" bit (that only she says) that I felt somewhat undercut her arc / their relationship.

hx01wjy,"I don't think they're saying that they need directors to ""tell them how to think"". I'm pretty sure their point is that without some sort of indication about how the character should be viewed, it's hard to determine if the film is glorifying/normalizing a relationship between a 15 and 25 year old. Don't get me wrong, if the age gap was mentioned once at the very beginning and never referenced again, I would be inclined to write it off as method for emphasising the ""childhood innocence vs gritty reality"" theme the movie has. That isn't really how it's treated though. 


As mentioned by others, they met at school, both characters acknowledge the age gap, Alana straight up asks her sister about it, she hides it from people, and it's a major moral dilemma for her throughout the movie. With that level of significance, its just weird that not even an allusion was made to how problematic that relationship is.


 To me, the lack of addressing the issue almost comes across as implicit support, which makes me feel weird about the movie. Is this something I'd want to recommend to people? Am I unintentionally supporting predatory behavior by reviewing the movie highly? Those are the type of questions that came to mind for me after viewing the film. I did enjoy the movie and I'm willing to accept that it's just a movie enjoy it for what it is. At the same time though, I saw it with my SO and we both felt the need to ask ""Was this whole movie a 25 year old loser grooming a 15 year child actor?""

My buddy had a take on the movie that kind of opened my eyes to why I 'hated' it so much. I guess the point of all these intolerable/flawed characters is to give an accurate depiction of life in the 70s. Many were sexist, racist, and homophobic, and it wasn't normal to stand up for yourself with any of these things - so people got away with it. The movie is supposed to encapsulate life without romanticizing how society actually was fifty years ago so we can see the social progress that may (or may not) have been made since then.

i15hbe6,"Part of the problem though is that with this relationship many of us viewers including myself see the relationship as innately fately flawed due to the age gap. If this movie was made decades ago, we may waive it as different mores of the time but of course that's not the case here. When we view a character's decision as fatally flawed we don't see their situation as happy so this can't be their happy ending from our lens. As a result, we're going to feel that what we were conveyed isn't correct because the language of the film is telling us this is a romantic or happy moment. There also isn't enough indication throughout the film at least for me to indicate that Alana's choice of Gary in the end is fatally flawed innately (even if we see this as a choice to never grow up I'm not convinced that that is a terrible thing in this world that PTA has shown us). A ""graduate moment"" would be trying to convey some statement that would contradict the romantic triumph and would engender a feeling that would relieve us of our confusion with whether the director understands the gravity of the two leads ""happy ending"". This would have been easy too such as perhaps having the kiss be uncomfortably long so the audience can have it firmly in their mind that this is a 25 year old making out with a 15 year old and illicit the natural disgust we feel at such interaxtions in the 2020s. I can still feel bad for Alana even with those feelings because I believe it comes from a place of confusion and toxicity that isn't intentionally malevolent.

I'm fine with subtle but the problem is people often forget the problematic nature of these romances when the woman is older, and even in this thread many cannot reconcile this aspect of the film and choose to ignore it. To me that speaks to too much ambiguity because we should have at least an inkling of what was trying to be conveyed, otherwise we cannot differentiate effective scenes with ineffective (and of course we can't give PTA the benefit of the doubt because he is PTA, not that you're doing that but some in this thread are).",ro10uh

Usually, but it is much worse, ignoring a red light in a busy intersection in the middle of the day, then it is in the middle of the night in the middle of a small town, with a highly visible intersection showing no contrary traffic. Yet in both cases, running the light is the same crime. 

Similar with showing Gary her breasts. Is it illegal? Yes, but there is nuance: Gary has consented numerous times (despite his inability to consent as a minor...) to this act, and Alana is showing not as an overt sexual act on her part, but to shut Gary up so they can move on. Again, not saying she should do it, or it is without harm for her to do so, but this particular act is much less egregious than other actions you are equating this with.",ro10uh

Movies can absolutely show these things, and that's why I was enjoying this movie for the first half, as I thought it was going to show how Alana realizes their relationship is hurting both her and Gary and then she moves on.

Instead, we're essentially left with a storybook ending of a 25 year old running into a 15 year old's arms and telling him she loves him.

>Gary's joke on stage

We see one of the last acts of his child acting career. It's pretty much over at that point (confirmed when he goes in for the kid's suit audition for Sears or whatever). So the rest of the movie Gary is trying get-rich schemes in lieu of his past child acting career (selling waterbeds, starting a pinball business, etc.) He's no longer a little child and thus not really fit for child acting, he's in the process of becoming a man but also not quite there yet.

>Photographer slapping her ass

Helps validate her distaste for the job and desire to move on to something else, even if it's helping a 15 year old sell waterbeds.

And pretty much all the other scenes lead to something else. Smashing Bradley's car - she realizes how immature he really is, how poorly he handles conflict with his passive aggressive mentality. Sean Penn leaving her in the dirt - she realizes how much Gary actually cares about her, when other grown men treat her like crap. The oil embargo - presented as Gary needing to find another business than waterbeds, as it could get unstable with the materials they require. Gary being arrested - shows her actual concern for him, and seems to strengthen their bond when she chases after him to the police station, etc, etc.",ro10uh
hq07rwg,"I think you're conflating no consequences with not mattering. I think all of these plot points you listed add to the film thematically and not from a plot perspective. 

For instance, Gary smashes Peter's (Bradley Cooper's character) car, and by the time that Alana parks the car after driving downhill, we see Peters smashing a window because he was angry, presumably due to Gary smashing his car. Both of them smashing someone else's property ultimately links the two characters. Gary is a kid who wants to be an adult but is ultimately a kid, whereas Peters is a character who is an adult, but ultimately acts like a kid when he doesn't get what he wants. 

The whole film is about holding onto childhood, and what it means to be an adult, so I think there is a purpose to the plot points you're mentioning. Maybe I'm reading too much in depth to the movie though.",ro10uh

It plays back into the absolute ignorance of the era and presents one of many vacuums of feeling, connection, and responsibility that were present at that time.

In both scenes the other characters are visibly uncomfortable, to the point that Gary snickers at his mom trying to handle how fucked up it is in the first scene. The character’s first wife has literally left him before the second scene.

The audience response is *supposed* to be in the vein of “Jesus fucking Christ”. If you still think it’s a problem then I guess that’s valid, but that’s a far cry from what the Twitter outrage was based in.",ro10uh

With the ending of Licorice Pizza, I guess it just depends on how much the age gap irks you and your personal views. Gary is a mature 15 year old who’s fallen in love with a 25 year old. Alana is an immature 25 year old who is charmed by a 15 year old who’s fallen in love with her. In their own, weird way, they’re right for each other. Is it wrong? Is it right? I don’t know.

I’ve seen so many critics wine about how sensitive and morally righteous people are, and how we can’t appreciate “good films” anymore, and it’s laughable because they can’t see how narrow-minded they’re being. It’s so easy to say all that when you’re not the butt of the joke and have seen it played out a million times in countless movies.

And what 25-year old woman could admire a boy with such crazy & criminal behavior.  The situation w/Sean Penn’s character was silly too.  The politician subplot was a mess too.  The best thing about the movie is the photographic representation of the the 1970’s - that’s it.

The difference is whether it seems like the movie is presenting the story as something positive or negative, and obviously that is not actually a black-and-white, binary thing and people will have different opinions, but I just think the ending and overall tone of the movie presented something that I think is weird (the age-gap in the romance) as either good, or at least acceptable given that the 15 year-old boy acts ""mature"" for his age.",ro10uh

Intermingled with these scenes are scenes that, if in any other meet cute movie, we’d love.

Have you ever been in love? I don’t mean mature love, or adult love. I mean puppy love. I mean when you don’t know what you’re doing, and a part of you knows that it isn’t right for you, but you are so absorbed in the situation that you don’t have perspective.  

I look back to my early relationships and cannot help but to cringe - it was so obvious that they wouldn’t work. But in the moment - at the time - I was able to push them aside. 

PTA, in my opinion, made a movie about two people who are in love, and are caught up in the moment. In a few years, they’ll both probably look back and cringe. Their relationship is probably and should be doomed.",ro10uh

His age plays a part in getting through to her because of the reasons I talked about before. He's still a creep, but he's not as guarded off as Penn and Safdie's characters are. Those two never let her in and don't completely see her as a person at times. For all his shortcomings, Gary always sees Alana.",ro10uh

hqikljd,"I agree with you, but I do think it’s important to acknowledge that sometimes jokes that are ostensibly about making fun of racists wind up just being racist themselves. South Park is a good example of this - Cartman’s antisemitism originated from Matt Stone’s experiences being bullied, except Cartman so rarely experiences any consequences or condemnation that it led to an increase in antisemitic bullying. The Ginger episode is another example where the butt of the joke is theoretically Cartman, except all it really did was make bullying redheaded kids *extremely* mainstream. Depictions of racism, sexism, and so on without *any* sort of commentary can inadvertently glorify or otherwise excuse that behavior.

It’s just that in Licorice Pizza, those depictions *always* have some sort of commentary attached. When Alana’s ass is slapped by her boss at the beginning of the movie, she very clearly doesn’t enjoy it and it can be inferred that it’s at least partially responsible for her quitting.

But I genuinely want to understand *how* exactly what the character does is racist, as opposed to just ignorant. Wouldn't that be the more operative word to describe it? He's not mocking his wives, he's not antagonizing them -- he's simply too ignorant of other cultures to understand the difference between an accent and fluent language/translation. I suppose you could consider the leap to calling it racist, but he's not discriminating against them, is he? Maybe racially insensitive is more accurate, since it's all directly related to language and a lack of understanding in that regard, not any wider assumptions or prejudice against Asian people.

The difference to me is that he's a shallow side character. His Japanese restaurant, wives, accent, etc are not the focus of the film. 



I don't need a film to spell everything out for me. I like to work for it, I like to theorize, but if you make a controversial topic the centerpiece of your film and seemingly encourage it, I feel like it's a little odd. Obviously it's a movie, so it really doesn't matter that much, but it comes across as an odd decision to make and to me adding the kiss at the end detracted from the theme and message.


Maybe that was intentional, in which case cool. Maybe it wasn't though, in which case I feel like the move could have been more impactful without the kiss, and purely focusing on a more pure, pragma type of love between them. I feel that would have been a more unique story.",ro10uh
