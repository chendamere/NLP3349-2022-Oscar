gn9m8y0,"This was captivating.  And it should make more people interested in learning more about Fred Hampton and his work.  He was truly a case of a visionary cut down way too soon (he was only 21 when he was murdered).

Daniel, Lakeith, and Jesse Plemmons were all great in their roles as well.

It’s not really a biopic of Hampton though, which might surprise some people.",lj1cfb
gnafvkt,"Dominique Fishback should be getting praise, I think people are carrying unfair baggage from her role in Project Power, which is not good, also because she’s not the main focus of the movie, but she should be getting Best Supporting Actress noms left and right. There have been Best Supporting actress nominations given to worse performances in the past, she deserves at least some recognition.",lj1cfb
gna7pfq," Kaluuya has such a strong screen presence, his speech scenes were completely magnetic and commanded the screen. He handled the softer scenes well too, especially liked when he was laughing with his girlfriend and reflecting on Emmet Till. Stanfied's performance was reserved but he nailed it, the tears in his eyes when he has to put Hampton to sleep was excellent.",lj1cfb
gnbn42a,"I enjoyed the movie, even as someone who knows a bit about the Panthers and especially the Rainbow Coalition in Chicago. I would highly recommend the documentary *American Revolution 2* (Parts [1](https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/191346), [2](https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/191347), and [3](https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/191348)) for those curious about the Rainbow Coalition, as well as [the PBS documentary](https://www.pbs.org/video/the-first-rainbow-coalition-q9hsug/). The Rainbow Coalition isn't given much attention, which disappointed me a little. But there's a lot to cover in a 2 hour movie while also telling the story of COINTELPRO. There seemed very little ""both sides"" kind of stuff going on. The police were absolutely villains throughout, as they should be. Which I appreciated. I can already predict the outrage from right-wingers and police unions about the depiction of killings of police officers. While there wasn't needless both sides kind of stuff, there obviously was the humanizing of O'Neal and the depiction of Mitchell in some shades of grey. But I think it does well to show the insidious way the system gets people to carry out oppression.

One very small detail of the movie that I appreciated was the reference to [intercommunalism](https://viewpointmag.com/2018/06/11/intercommunalism-the-late-theorizations-of-huey-p-newton-chief-theoretician-of-the-black-panther-party/) at the beginning of the film. [There's a good talk over this theory developed by Huey P Newton by the author of the linked article](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bpS49ytdm4). The way various Panthers developed theories of revolutionary socialism I am also interested in, [like Lorenzo Komboa Ervin](https://blackrosefed.org/announcing-black-autonomy-podcast/) who is still around. [Kuwasi Balagoon](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273895582_Maroon_Kuwasi_Balagoon_and_the_Evolution_of_Revolutionary_New_Afrikan_Anarchism) is another who is no longer around, who [has inspired](https://cooperationjackson.org/lumumba-center) groups like [Cooperation Jackson](https://cooperationjackson.org/) that [build and fight for a better world](https://truthout.org/articles/build-and-fight-the-program-and-strategy-of-cooperation-jackson/). Many Panthers are still incarcerated [or did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o05OYFKHpew) very long [stints in prison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxxnjlJ2nNo). [The Jericho Movement](https://thejerichomovement.com/) was [founded by ex-Panthers](https://www.treyfpodcast.com/2020/07/28/47-ashanti-alston/) that [now support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKrpMLDyev0) the many political prisoners from various movements. The [echoes of the Panthers and their politics run through anti-prison movements today](https://incarceratedworkers.org/freedom-first), which are [happening right now](https://rampantmag.com/2021/02/09/this-is-genocide/).",lj1cfb

gn8813d,"Kaluuya was captivating from start to finish. Also Plemmons once again nailing this role of seemingly harmless yet deeply disturbing villain. Gave me vibes of Todd from Breaking Bad where he seems gentle but clearly inside he's void and capable of some messed up stuff. The scene where Bill asks if he's going to kill Fred was so heartbreaking. It was that desperation in Bill's voice ""you won, what more do you want"" and Plemmons' soulless eyes that really made it clear who he was.",lj1cfb
gn8bhby,"Damn I loved this movie. Kaluuya and Stanfield were amazing of course. I specifically loved Kaluuya’s take on Fred Hampton. The way he just observes and hangs on to every word someone is saying in a conversation is a great touch. 

I also loved how Shaka King explores the Black Panther Party in this. The scene where Ms. Winters is grieving over her son and says something along the lines of “Yeah he did that...but that shouldn’t be his legacy.” I took that as to how the Black Panthers are still viewed today. Yeah they were militant, and they took extreme measures in practicing their second amendment rights; but they did so protecting their neighborhoods from a tyrannical unjust system, the amount of good they did for the people in their neighborhoods shouldn’t be overlooked, from the money they put into it and the clinics they’ve built. 

Anyway, great film. Definitely will be taking advantage of its HBO Max run.",lj1cfb
gn8cw3e,"The ‘I AM A REVOLUTIONARY’ scene inside the church is absolutely phenomenal. Not only is Kaluuya’s performance incredible but the scene has so much stakes involved for All the characters that elevates this very powerful Hampton speech to an amazing scene.

gnhltia,"Hey Reddit I'm late to the page, but as a producer on this movie just want to thank everyone for watching and for discussing as always.

gn8wjoo,The climactic scene where Hampton is unconscious while all this shit is going down just turned my stomach. Awful (but brilliantly done).,lj1cfb
gnjhpo1,"Outstanding movie that deserves the highest level of recognition possible. Stanfield and Kaluuya were incredible. Also, Deborah Johnson was a great supporting actress as well. I think she should be nominated. Cinematography and soundtrack for this were pristine as well.

This movie is perfect timing and I agree with one of the movie critics who said that this movie doesn't hold back in showing police as the true villains during the civil rights movement.

Just the fact that they manipulated a 17 year old to infiltrate the Black Panthers to not only imprison a 23-year-old Fred Hampton, but also to murder him speaks volumes for why black people feel the way we do about law enforcement. It also illustrates them planting a crabs in a barrel mentality in the black community. They cornered O'neal to poison him and give up the blueprint to his location. 

**99 shots fired by the police, 1 fired back from the Black Panthers.**

99 shots for a man who was asleep with his pregnant girlfriend.

Just absolutely fucking sickening. And then they turn around and arrest them for attempted murder. The cops were fucking smiling in pictures when they removed his body. 

A 12 year trial that starts at 47 million for damages and settles at less than 2 million.

Someone mentioned Do the Right Thing, which cinematically takes place ~20 years later and both movies do a great job at showing that the more time passes, the more things stay the same.

Excellent movie, excellent depiction of a story, and much needed for the culture.",lj1cfb

gnasvx9,Daniel Kaluuya deserves every award he could possibly get for his portrayal of Fred Hampton. There were times when he wasn't onscreen that I legitimately missed his presence; that's how you know he was fantastic.,lj1cfb
gnm8x4n,"Kaluuya was amazing; His best performance yet. But, this movie and movies like it are always tough, even more so due to the fact that my mother, a former Black Panther, passed away last year due dementia. She is the strongest person I've ever known and we were best friends. 

The leg work the FBI did to destroy and dismantle just about every black empowerment  movement crushes me every time I'm reminded of it. My mother was an angel, but what she endured when she moved from Jersey to Georgia was terrible. Racists being in power have this God-forsaken phobia of minorities, and the means to which they will take to eradicate any movement is absolutely ridiculous. Hoover and racists like him always made it seem like the safety of the country is dependent on minorities being oppressed (a tactic still used till this day). But, each movement (NAACP, Black Panther etc)  was sparked by the murder of Emmitt Till and the thousands of other senseless murders of minorities. This country will never get to where it needs to be until the powers that be listen with open ears to people who can convey the ""Black"" experience properly with the goal of putting pieces in place to eliminate this state and corporate-sanctioned bigotry hatred. This America that we are in now is better than the one my mother grew up in, but we still have a lonngggg way to go.

This film did a great job of conveying why the Black Panthers existed; It was never to push fear, only preservation. Hampton Jr. was robbed of a father, the nation was robbed of a Kennedy, of a King, all because of this phobia of minorities.

I miss you mom...",lj1cfb
gn8dcce,"I still don't like framing the film through O'Neal's perspective (for a variety of reasons) but this film might not have gotten made otherwise. Shout out to Chairman Fred Hampton Jr. for being on set pretty much every day and correcting all kinds of misinformation, even when Warner Bros. tried to stop him (and shout out to Ryan Coogler for fighting for him to stay involved). A lot of people don't realize how different this film is due to Chairman Fred Jr. fighting battles day in and day out. A few facts I'd like to highlight that aren't necessarily presented in the film are 1) O'Neal was not the only informant, in fact it is believed that Mitchell alone had 9 others who are still not identified, and 2) COINTELPRO didn't die with Hoover, these are systemic tactics that the State utilizes to this day. Chairman Fred Sr.'s tombstone is shot up by cops regularly, and there are a number of Black Panther Party members who were targeted that are still locked up as political prisoners to this day.

From a historical standpoint it may not be perfect, but as Chairman Fred Jr. told me a few days ago, ""You can't put a shark in a fish tank"". I hope the film performs well and opens the door for future projects that can more fully flesh out the politics of the Black Panther Party (imagine a series focusing on different BPP Chapters per season!). In the meantime I look forward to the discussions of the film and strongly encourage people to research the subject. For a good start I'll recommend watching the documentaries [The Murder of Fred Hampton](https://vimeo.com/434141029) and [All Power to the People](https://youtu.be/pKvE6_s0jy0), and be sure to check out [the Judas and the Black Messiah Podcast](https://medium.com/prxofficial/proximity-99-invisible-and-warner-bros-15e4d6ac8b4c) that provides historical context from Chairman Fred Jr. and actual members of the Illinois Chapter of the BPP.",lj1cfb

This movie remind me of like a historical epic in the way shots are framed to fit a giant screen, the colors poped more and the sound mixing is done so that certain sounds are done for certain audio channels of theater.

It made me remember why i love movies, and made me sad too see people losing interest in the theatrical experiences,To me this movie only reaffirms why should not go away, as I feel it wouldn't make the same emotional impact if i was watching this on my 42 inch tv  on my couch with the sunlight pouring in and random discrations",lj1cfb

LaKeith outstanding as expected. These guys are gonna win awards.

When they put up the text at the end saying Chairman Fred was only 21 years old. Man, if you didn’t know that before seeing this movie you’d probably assume he was a bit older like late 20s or 30 similar to Kaluuya. It’s absolutely crushing.",lj1cfb

Idk I felt underwhelmed.",lj1cfb
gn9ownz,"I commented on another discussion thread my thoughts on Kaluuya and Stanfield’s exceptional performances, and how I hoped this movie inspires many to research our government’s failings throughout history. 

Another revolutionary that isn’t well known is Steve Biko in South Africa. He was a medical student that created and led the anti-apartheid Black Consciousness movement, coined the term “Black is beautiful”, and helped organize healthcare centers in Black neighborhoods throughout South Africa. He was arrested for leaving his hometown, was severely beaten, and murdered by the police at the age of 30. If you’re interested in Hampton’s story, I recommend reading into Biko as well",lj1cfb
gnrv742,"Liked them leaning into the religious angle of the title for the final sequence. 

Judas being given the pieces of silver (Bill getting silver keys for his gas station)

Fred declining the money to go on the run and instead open up a clinic (Jesus announced this is my body given to you. You could argue Fred was exchanging his body to prison for the medical clinic) and just generally preparing them for his absence. 

They were all drinking some kind of red drink, reminiscent of the wine at the last supper, which would later become part of the communion ceremony. 

And the fact the last scene was literally Fred and his lieutenants having a last meal together. 

It was moving imagery for a heartbreaking end to the story, but tied the theme up nicely.",lj1cfb
gn8m29h,"My only gripe with the movie is that it didn’t show more of the good that the Black Panthers did for their community — the after school programs, soup kitchens, arming citizens, informing people of their rights, etc.

It definitely touched on those aspects, but more so in conversation rather than on screen. Instead, it showed a lot of cop killings which was only a small part of their manifesto.

Overall, it was an incredible movie and more revolutionaries need their own biopics because the medium of film is often times the best way to inform the public of our unsung heroes.",lj1cfb
gnc4cr7,"I was so furious at Bill at the end of the of movie, but when I found out he commit suicide it made me realize even though he lacked integrity he was SO young (20 when Fred was murdered), and ultimately a victim of a system so heavily stacked against him. I imagine there were some nights he would lie awake and wish he had been murdered instead so as not to live with the guilt. 

This movie was the first I'd learned of Fred Hampton and I was riveted by his message and the story. I am dying to watch the eyes on the prize episode with the william o'neal interview but I can't find the second season anywhere. Has any one else been able to find it?

1) Kaluuya and Stanfield gave wonderful performances but they're each 10 years too old and I found it distracting the entire time.

2) the movie sort of frames the FBI's concern with the Panthers as primarily based on racism and sort of downplays the concern over a proletariat uprising.

gn9yauw,This is Kaluuyas best role yet and every scene he is in just hooked me. Easily the best portrayal of Hampton yet. Lakeiths performance is more understated and grounded which complements Kaluuyas performance. I love the grainy jazz soundtrack that plays throughout the movie and the other technicals of the movie are great as well. I didn’t know that Hampton died at 21 and for someone to be so eloquent and powerful at his age is extremely rare. I also think it’s one of the better portrayals of the black panther or black liberation movements I’ve seen.

But man, it had me thinking about how all the big black political leaders of the 60's were either killed or ended up in jail.  MLK, Malcolm X, Fred Hampton.

I thought Martin Sheen as Hoover was way over the top and cartoonish, though. Hoover should have been so terrifying and the malignant presence he really was, wasn't translated as effectively as it could have been. 

I also believe the film tried to take a shotgun approach to telling this story vs something a little more exacting. By trying to split time between Hampton and O'Neal's stories we really didn't get to truly dive deep into either character the way we should have. I rarely say this, but this film could have been longer. The pacing was strange at times and, for the reason I mentioned, it felt like the film was just covering things to connect the dots of the plot. 

I ultimately was left wanting at the end, and I wonder if a more adept director would have been able to do more with this story. Ultimately, I am so happy this film was made as it's so important that the United States never forgets the heroes like Hampton, Seale, Newton, et al.

gn8yh5o,"As excellent as the two lead performances were, I do think the movie missed something by not casting younger actors. Fred Hampton was only 21, and William O'Neal was 20 when the events of the movie happened, and that just makes it so much more tragic.",lj1cfb

gnicabh,"As a movie I think it ran a bit long and had a lot of issues with pacing. It feels like different movies at times, shifting between O'Neal (maintaining his cover, feeling divided about being a betrayer to a greater cause, etc.), Hampton (his relationship with Deborah, his teachings and speeches), Roy Mitchell (his scenes coercing O'Neal into doing unsavory things contrasted with his uncomfortable reactions to what his FBI colleagues are telling him about how they're conducting the operation) and the miscellaneous Black Panther perspectives. It was really well-acted but for the most part felt bloated to me. 

The movie does finish really strong however, the assassination of Fred Hampton was intense and really powerful. The end describing events that followed, while disappointingly in text, was also shocking. It made me want to read more about the lawsuit and what happened to O'Neal. Overall it was thought-provoking but I think as a movie it was a bit on the messier side.",lj1cfb
gnpmo50,"How did the end make you guys feel? I may be wrong, I may have ZERO empathy, but I felt like Bill was a traitor through & through. He chose HIMSELF over an entire movement..no kids, no wife..could’ve came to Jesus as to speak at any time but still walked out. What would his son think of him? He’s no hero.

Totally not the same, but that final scene gave me vibes of “Wonderland” & I almost didn’t watch it. The parallels to today in this movie are insane & it shows you how these negative phrases are so tired..even back in the 70’s they were using words such as communists, leftists to dehumanize people simply asking for equality. FBI shot 90+ bullets into Fred Hamptons residence while he was sleeping, LMPD shot 30+ into Breonna Taylor’s residence...both were innocent & the state sanctioned murders 50 fucking years apart. The fact that her killers are walking the street free men, shows us that this system STILL really hasn’t changed",lj1cfb

gni8b9e,"Hmm, I dunno how to feel about this movie. I was really looking forward to it and the trailer blew me away. But I guess I'd say I was disappointed. It was by no means a bad movie, but it felt lacking.

I think the main thing it was missing for me was I feel there should have been more of a connection between Daniel and Lakeith's characters. The two barely interact throughout the movie and their last major interaction before the night Fred dies was them fighting over Bill's suggestion of blowing up a government building. And then they don't really have any big interaction that last night, just Bill offering to refill Fred's drink

I didn't really feel any sympathy for Bill's plight, I don't feel there was any real moment where he starts to question what he's doing. I thought maybe the blowing up the building thing was all him, but then you see he had a wire so it was just more scheming.

I know it's a historical drama, so perhaps this really was the extent of their relationship, but as a narrative film, I feel they really needed more of a closer relationship. They at least should have had a bigger final scene together beyond just Bill standing off to the side before swooping in to offer Fred a refill so he can drug him. I feel they could have fudged this a bit more to make a more interesting narrative.

As is, the movie feels like two largely unconnected halves, the Bill side and the Fred side. It's a shame because there were a lot of great performances in this movie, but it just didn't really hit home for me.",lj1cfb

In terms of the actual film and its cross referencing of biblical cannon which we as the viewers have to acknowledge, I also saw the similarities shred with the film The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. A prophet of their time cut down by a puppet of a greater evil. 
As a veteran the conflict concludes in this: the American government, the ruling party, will NOT allow defeat, Outside or in, as it is against its nature which has to be accepted by any understanding of any revolutionary. It will do everything in its power at any cost of its soul to retain the power. Evils aside the words of the constitution and bill of rights demand freedom for the people and the means to think and defend said rights. To retain the power. This is the biggest hypocrisy to exist. We, as the people, are able to witness this hypocrisy, call it into question, and ratify it as the true power is within our hands. Under no organization outside our borders or brewed within them shall trump those words and hoist their flag over the capital or the grounds it represents. The argument against this logic has always directly lead to their demise. The people of this country have to abandon their fear to not only uphold this solemn promise of freedom and equality but preserve it under the flag of the United States.

Unfortunately none of this new, but I watch foreign sporting events (ex. English Premier League) and see players of all nationalities & creed take a knee against racism.

The film arguably spends more time on O'Neal than it does on Hampton and it was honestly a bit jarring to witness.  
Additionally, Martin Sheen as J. Edgar Hoover needed more screen time because I felt it would have added a lot more to the film to have him as the looming dark villain pulling the strings from behind the scenes.

The shootout scene was INCREDIBLE imo. Felt like a gut punch and carried so much emotional weight.  
The direction was also very good and Kaluuya's charismatic performance was incredible, but I feel Lakeith Stanfield stands out as the star of this film. Could have been better, but could have been much worse.

Otherwise dont add so many melodramatic action scenes when they feel aimless.

go70m8n,"thought it was really good, and to me surprise it really showed how nuanced the tension around that time was (when I expected the story to be very one sided). all the characters were just caught in scenarios going from bad to worse where at the least they had to betray their ideals and it only scaled up from there.

i feel sympathy for Bill's character where he essentially got stuck between a rock and a hard place with no way out and I felt worse to read what happened to him after that first documentary in the 80s. in general every character was at least a bit sympathetic with the exception of Hoover; especially when Fred kept telling everyone not to escalate the tension and violence because it would just bring more down upon them but you also can't blame the people from boiling over (even if their actions such as the kid in the shootout could be deemed selfish because of what it would lead to for the rest of the chapter).

I'm not sure how accurate it is to the real Roy Mitchell if at all, but one of the things I really liked about how his character in the film was portrayed is how generally uncomfortable/appalled he seemed to be towards the racism he was uncovering, but how at the same time he was too afraid to actually do anything about it. There've been plenty of people within bad systems throughout the course of history (as well as presently) who've seen the failings of either their systems, superiors or co-workers conduct and chose to be complicit out of either fear or convenience.

A lot of people can say they'd act differently than Mitchell in those situations, but I think the film did a really good job of showing how difficult that actually is in that sort of environment.",lj1cfb

Take something like the Trial of the Chicago 7. You were on their side the whole time. In this film, I could only sympathize with Fred. He seemed like a great character and a great person. I was in his side, but when things like what happened to Winters or to a lesser extent, Jimmy Palmer, I was shocked to see they put that in the film. It is almost like the Director wanted us to see the flaws in the BPP. Fred was this person who believed in change. He never was the type to do something stupid. I felt that Winters and Palmer committed a very stupid crime, but it doesn’t seem like I was SUPPOSED to feel that way. That’s now how anyone else viewed it. Fred said to name the clinic after Winters, but he seemed to be someone that the BPP would not want to be associated with. Palmer didn’t need to die like he did, but he did need to go to jail. These are 2 people who decided it was OK to kill cops without being threatened by cops. That was not a solution that Fred would have condoned, but he never says that. I just don’t know how to we are supposed to take their deaths.",lj1cfb

More like top 10 for sure. I was kind of expecting more from it but it did a very good job at portraying history and the acting was superb so I’ll give it that.

We’re introduced to Bill O’Neal early on but when Fred is on screen, he feels like the center of the plot. I’ll admit (sadly) that I’ve never heard about Fred Hampton until I saw the movie trailer and I was excited to learn more about him and the Chicago BPP chapter. 

As I was watching though, outside of Fred and O’Neal, I had trouble connecting with anyone in the movie and it felt like I wasn’t allowed to. The film doesn’t do enough to make me care about the side characters even though they take up 70% of the runtime. What about their stories, and motivations? Did they not matter? 

If you’re going to feed me side characters for 70% of the movie, I expect to learn about them as well as they ARE part of the history and they matter too.

I’m incredibly thankful for the film exposing me to Fred as the research done after the movie was worth it; I just feel like the movie didn’t do a good job at creating empathy/sympathy for its characters.

gukweut,"This movie's biggest strength is its portrayal of Fred Hampton. I know this movie is supposed to be about Bill O'Neal, but it's definitely about Hampton more. I've seen biopics that change their subject's behavior and soften their edges to make them more sympathetic to modern audiences, like The Trial of the Chicago Seven. I've seen ones where they make up scenes that villainize the subject, like Vice. This one is neither. It puts extensive effort into making sure the character lines up with what we know about the actual person. Fred is not transformed into a modern hero, he is very of his time and talks about what he actually spent his life doing. The best biopics aren't focused on trying to make you like or dislike someone, they show you who he actually was and let you decide for yourself. 

I don't even care that Kaluuya's accent slips fairly often. That speech scene in front of the crowd declaring that they're revolutionaries is perfect. For most Oscar nominees for acting, you can tell the scene they intended for the reel, the one people will associate with the movie. This is that scene. 

Alternatively, *man* I hated the scene with Hoover talking directly to Mitchell about his daughter taking home a black guy. ""Hey, guy who already knows me, would you like me to talk about how racist I am so that if an invisible audience is watching they'll know how racist I am?"" It is the most jarring lack of screenwriting tact in the entire movie and screeches it to a grinding halt. I guess they're trying to make Mitchell slightly more sympathetic by scapegoating Hoover, which isn't something they needed to do or should have tried for. 

I feel like they kinda pulled a trick on an audience who would probably be unfamiliar with the Young Patriots Organization. This wasn't a neo-Confederate white supremacist organization, which is what most of us would think when we saw that flag. They're a socialist group made of white Southerners.

h7dro8o,"As a ""fan"" of Fred Hampton who believes his story of unrealistic potential for doing good in the world is truly tragic, I was not a fan of this film at all. Stanfield's portrayal was great. But the portrayal of Fred Hampton was, in my opinion, inaccurate and did not do the actual Hampton justice. The real Fred Hampton was a very young kid. He was a humanitarian and a revolutionary ideologue, but he was also pragmatic, realistic, and incredibly laser-focused. Kaluuya's Fred Hampton was old and jaded, smug and self-righteous, and an incendiary rabble rouser. The real Fred Hampton could have been an all-time historical figure. The film's Fred Hampton would never rise above being a street soldier.   


There also was minimal material or ideological context. You aren't presented with the material conditions that necessitated revolution. You are presented with the fact that Hampton was, at his core, a humanitarian. You are presented with a war film between two sides: (a) racist cops with very little actual perspective, and (b) a bunch of aimless street criminals.",lj1cfb

There was an artist that refused to be on the soundtrack after she learned it wasn’t a true biopic.

There’s that really uncomfortable scene where Hoover asks Mitchell what he’d do if his daughter brought home a black man - and I got the sense that Mitchell fundamentally didn’t view the world in that way before being asked that. He seemed like a strict “law and order” type who didn’t see the Panthers from the race war perspective that Hoover was coming from. We get a lot of hints in the FBI scenes that Mitchell knows what they’re doing is wrong, but that person is gone whenever we see him tasking Bill with his next step (there seem to be a lot of parallels between the Hoover/Mitchell relationship and the Mitchell/Bill one). 

And yet all of that doesn’t matter, because the end result is the same whether or not Mitchell was as much of an overt racist as Hoover was - innocent people are dead. White supremacy survives and thrives not because of the Hoovers of the world, but because of the Mitchells - the people who put career advancement, law and order, whatever over right and wrong.",lj1cfb

gnjzy0o,"Thank you for this comment. I was a little discouraged when I opened this thread and people seemed to only care about the film making and seemingly werent interested in the subject matter. 

>Yeah they were militant, and they took extreme measures in practicing their second amendment rights;

This is one of things I wanted to delve into. I think the ""War and Politcs"" scene early on did an excellent job of framing the proper context. Too often in history we are taught about the reaction but ignore the initial action.  In this context the action is these black neighborhoods were being occupied by a hostile force(cops). The cops are already taking extreme action, but its never framed that way. When people react extremely to the cops actions, we label the reaction extreme but give the police a pass. Its similar to the George Floyd protest this summer where conservative outlets and reactionaries focused on the reactions to the killing  and kept the discussion on the rioters and not what they were rioting about. 

Coming into this movie I was already sympathetic toward Hampton, so that didnt change. What did change was noticing the parallels with our occupation of the middle east. We go  into foreign countries and intentionally destabilize the region in order for us to remain in power. The people in these countries can clearly see that our occupation isnt helping anything and we end up creating a breeding ground for ""extremism"". I used quotes because I think its important to consider who is doing the labeling. 

During one of the Hoover speeches in the movie I was thinking to myself ""I can see why law enforcement would be afraid of movement s like the black panthers "", It totally makes sense from their point of view. At the same time I can totally see why people like the Panthers would feel the way they did about law enforcement because of the way law enforcement dealt with their communities. 

Just remember ""politics is war without bloodshed while war is politics with bloodshed"" the next time you see people waiving their blue lives matter or thin blue line flags"" Think about the political message they are sending. Think about how blue lives matter is said in a direct response to black lives matter.  Then ask yourself if these people are really oblivious to the idea that they are drawing a line in the sand between cops and black people.",lj1cfb

gn8oxhr,"I’m really interested in the politics of Chairman Fred  Sr. Namely that he put the class struggle above all else and was a committed anti-capitalist. The movie didn’t shy away from being aggressively anti-government and also showed how he built the rainbow coalition. He explicitly mentions the universal struggle for freedom of all oppressed people in a way that would have no doubt pissed off a lot of black nationalist Panthers. 

With that said, it’s my understanding that Chairman Fred Jr. did do a lot to add his fathers true ideas to the film. However I have a bone to pick with him. His dad was someone who saw through the veneer of racism and understood it was a tool used to sow dissent among the underclass. But Chairman Fred Jr. was jailed for firebombing a Korean grocery after the LA riots. I agree that the tension was high and there was blood on the Korean community’s hands, but a Marxist wouldn’t have attacked a poor to middle class grocery store owner. They would have attacked the system that let off Soon Ja Du in the first place. That’s the real enemy. 

It’s likely Chairman Fred Jr. changed in prison. But I can’t help but feel that he’s most definitely not his father and that him firebombing a Korean small business is a great metaphor for how disorganized and separated the class struggle is now. I can’t help but think of the weaknesses of the BLM movement where they’re a leaderless hydra with no direction and thus very little political power.

The movie never had footing or flow for a second. Scenes just happened with no impact and you could tell the directing was to overact as Oscar bait in so many scenes that it loses the viewer — people are suddenly giving monologues out of nowhere for no real established reasons at all quite frequently. The movie also has this insane smarminess that it gives off due to King very clearly being so in love with their own writing that they just never elevate it for a visual medium. So so many scenes are just characters speaking dialogue for far too long and it causes for the mantra of show not tell to fail entirely.

When Bill is in Roy's house and Roy says, paraphrasing;

The scene takes on almost a completely different meaning when you know he's young. I watched it last night and just have been going back and forth all day about it in my mind.

But I don't think the film showed us any of it.

O'Neal was kinda going along with what the FBI was telling him to do, then he felt bad about it for whatever reason, then came back around and listened to the FBI again, and was sad about it for whatever reason.

To be fair I think in real life Bill didn't really have a huge relationship with Fred and wasn't really all that shaken up about turning him in.

Could you explain what you mean exacty?  I'm guessing you dislike the title for some misguided religious reasons, but I can't remember what was said at the end that could have made it so much worse.  Personally, I think the title fits pretty well given what the film was about.

I do think the film intends you have certain level of sympathy for Bill. The FBI wasn't going to let him just refuse to cooperate, no matter what they said.  They likely would have found a way to kill Fred even if he had refused to cooperate.  Considering how things ended for Bill, I'm not sure those nuances matter much.  He was still on the wrong side.

I don't think Roy is all that sympathetic. He may have been creeped out by Hoover's extremism, but he didn't do anything about.  He still followed orders and helped organize the assassination.

If you have people like Fred Hampton and Bobby Seale and Huey Newton as the face and the force behind an organization it means the government can just throw them in prison for whatever arbitrary reason they choose and it kills the movement.

This movie even specifically and explicitly talks about this when Hampton sent away for four years for the ice cream shit. The Chicago party suffered hugely because they relied on him so much.

We say we're not going to fight capitalism with black capitalism, but we're going to fight it with socialism."" but the entire segment and real-life portion of the Rainbow Coalition that shows his interaction with working and poor white Southerners of the Young Patriots who even brandish Confederate flags and who sign on the Rainbow Coalition.

This ability to unite Chicago's proles and lumpen, which represents minute differences (moreso then than now) in material conditions along identity groups compared to the massive difference in the capital-owning & protecting classes to themselves, is what made Hampton especially threatening to the intelligence agencies and what created the ""Messiah"" image that they feared.

gnlamgg,"Full quote

“I must make two honest confessions  to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that  over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white  moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the  Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the  White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white  moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a  negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which  is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in  the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct  action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for  another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who  constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season.""  Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than  absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance  is much more bewildering than outright rejection.

I  had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order  exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in  this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the  flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would  understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of  the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro  passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive  peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human  personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not  the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden  tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can  be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as  it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural  medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the  tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the  air of national opinion before it can be cured.

In  your statement you assert that our actions, even though peaceful, must  be condemned because they precipitate violence. But is this a logical  assertion? Isn't this like condemning a robbed man because his  possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn't this  like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and  his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by the misguided  populace in which they made him drink hemlock? Isn't this like  condemning Jesus because his unique God consciousness and never ceasing  devotion to God's will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must  come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it  is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic  constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate violence.  Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber. I had also hoped  that the white moderate would reject the myth concerning time in  relation to the struggle for freedom. I have just received a letter from  a white brother in Texas. He writes: ""All Christians know that the  colored people will receive equal rights eventually, but it is possible  that you are in too great a religious hurry. It has taken Christianity  almost two thousand years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of  Christ take time to come to earth."" Such an attitude stems from a tragic  misconception of time, from the strangely irrational notion that there  is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all  ills. Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used either  destructively or constructively. More and more I feel that the people of  ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of  good will. We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the  hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling  silence of the good people. Human progress never rolls in on wheels of  inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to  be co workers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes  an ally of the forces of social  stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time  is always ripe to do right. Now is the time to make real the promise of  democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative  psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from  the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.”

gnlaaqu,"“I must make two honest confessions  to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that  over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white  moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the  Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the  White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white  moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a  negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which  is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in  the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct  action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for  another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who  constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season.""  Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than  absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance  is much more bewildering than outright rejection.

I  had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order  exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in  this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the  flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would  understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of  the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro  passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive  peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human  personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not  the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden  tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can  be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as  it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural  medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the  tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the  air of national opinion before it can be cured.

In  your statement you assert that our actions, even though peaceful, must  be condemned because they precipitate violence. But is this a logical  assertion? Isn't this like condemning a robbed man because his  possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn't this  like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and  his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by the misguided  populace in which they made him drink hemlock? Isn't this like  condemning Jesus because his unique God consciousness and never ceasing  devotion to God's will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must  come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it  is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic  constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate violence.  Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber. I had also hoped  that the white moderate would reject the myth concerning time in  relation to the struggle for freedom. I have just received a letter from  a white brother in Texas. He writes: ""All Christians know that the  colored people will receive equal rights eventually, but it is possible  that you are in too great a religious hurry. It has taken Christianity  almost two thousand years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of  Christ take time to come to earth."" Such an attitude stems from a tragic  misconception of time, from the strangely irrational notion that there  is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all  ills. Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used either  destructively or constructively. More and more I feel that the people of  ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of  good will. We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the  hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling  silence of the good people. Human progress never rolls in on wheels of  inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to  be co workers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes  an ally of the forces of social  stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time  is always ripe to do right. Now is the time to make real the promise of  democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative  psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from  the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.”

>Arendt's book introduced the expression and concept of the banality of evil. Her thesis is that Eichmann was actually not a fanatic or a sociopath, but instead an extremely average and mundane person who relied on clichéd defenses rather than thinking for himself, was motivated by professional promotion rather than ideology, and believed in success which he considered the chief standard of ""good society"". Banality, in this sense, does not mean that Eichmann's actions were in any way ordinary, or even that there is a potential Eichmann in all of us, but that his actions were motivated by a sort of complacency which was wholly unexceptional

Plemons' character may have started out with a pseudo-idealistic view but when push came to shove he just went along, like Eichmann did, even if he didn't believe it (originally Eichmann claimed to want to relocate Jews but then did his ""job"" killing them as ordered).

gnfhxp3,"> Few of the people COINTELPRO and HUAC targeted were actually Soviet agents

I didn't say any of them were Soviet agents. I was saying socialist worker movements, especially those that revolved around race were a particular threat to the United States as they could have caused the domestic revolution that the Soviet Union wanted. The Soviet Union's goal during the Cold War was to spread 
 communism and socialism globally and to defeat the US from the inside out that way. The cold war was an actual thing and an actual existential threat, the Soviet Union and commuism being an existential threat was not a myth created by Hoover... That was an objective national security threat",lj1cfb
gnfkhbo,"> ""Russia was influencing people""

I did not say anything remotely close to that. I said the SOVIET UNION relied on socialist populist movements as sources for civil unrest and potential revolution during a time they were spreading communism throughout the entire world and trying to win the war of ideas in the United States. A path to victory for them during the cold war was to foment and support socialist populist movements that were socialist in nature in order to destroy the United States from within. Also ""mass media"" existed during the Cold War... Russia and the Soviet Union are insanely different, one was driven by communism trying to conquer the world and the other was not. 

I am not ""defending"" these actions from Hoover and the FBI in the sense that I would do the same thing or support those efforts then. I am just pointing out where the FBI/government was coming from. Movements that revolved around black equality, especially from a working class socialist perspective were seen as existential threats beyond the racist backdrop they often took due to the Cold War and the Soviet Union's efforts to promote socialism and communism.",lj1cfb

The most prominent organizers, take BLM movements, don't interact or acknowledge poor whites really at all. Leadership really wouldn't visit a Southern workers union or Southern pride group of low-income workers to try to form a coalition. The goal is no longer the solidarity that Hampton so fiercely fought to achieve. I think it's crucial to remember that Hampton would not have supported a modern abandonment of class solidarity and that's why it so defines him as opposed to many other BPP and civil rights leaders.

gnkkgfu,"First off, not all white guys in the 60/70s were racist (or at least were as bad as his character). This is a pet peeve of mine; we excuse the behavior of individuals in history because “everyone did that/was like that” and pointedly ignore the many that weren’t. 

Look at slavery. “Oh well our founding fathers can be excused because...”. Yeah, well  there were plenty of people who saw slavery as abhorrent in that time period. For example, quakers were some of the earliest abolitionists. These founding father figures knew all this, and still chose to behave as they did. 

This is a movie about radical (one) movements. As it turns out, we love to ignore the history and actions of these movements (a pretty key piece of the movie). Radical movements for decades were opposed to how blacks were treated. The weather underground engaged in direct action (I’m not going to discuss them or whether they were right) in direct response to how the black Panthers, Fred Hampton were treated. 

Point is, radical whites were not as racist, or at least often problematic, were doing much more than this character. And we excuse horrible behavior when we pretend as if Marxists, anarchists, socialists, weren’t for many decades prior, explicitly calling out this bullshit. It’s a function of the liberal government, that we pretend as if radical leaders weren’t years ahead of moderate whites in calling attention to the many injustices (against lgbtq, against people of color, against women, etc). 

Back to Mitchell specifically. Of course he’s concerned with “law and order”. This is the whole point. It’s a direct parallel to blm. I’m not sure the director meant that, but I’m sure he would agree. The white guy who cares more about the small amount of looting or fires or “unrest” more than the systematic murder of black men.

 These days it’s mostly nimbyism. I saw it in my city. Well off whites who were fine with the broad messages of blm, but who wanted an end to the protests and unrest after like a week, because at the end of the day, they care more about protecting their lifestyle, the peace of privilege, than they do about justice for George Floyd.

Go to Portland subreddit and read about recent protests, and you’ll see all this nimbyism. People who truly care more about some windows being smashed than they do about liberating people of color. Of course they are racist; they would rather live a peaceful life where black men are routinely shot in the street, than to see mass protests block traffic, or smash windows of a govt building. They would rather black women be shot while sleeping, than an occasional Macy’s get looted. 

This is a frequent problem, it’s super similar to kings “white moderate”. I saw it a lot with people in my life. “Well I fundamentally agree with rights for black people, but I don’t like how it inspires looting and unrest”. Yup, they want law and order over justice. It’s not klan racism (or Hoover’s form in the movie), but it’s not really different in the end result.

The Cold War was real sure but Hampton and the Panthers weren’t looking to turn America into another SSR. They were looking to better the living conditions of those struggling economically and societally. Hoover just used the threat of “socialism and the Soviets” to label that movement as inherently evil and wrong-headed,lj1cfb

I also think lakieth did an incredible job with his role and the movie itself never conveyed him as a hero, but it also never showed him as a victim. And if you take a step back he absolutely was a victim. With that being said, we can’t excuse him for his crimes, because they are his own, but it’s important to recognize how he was a victim as well. There’s nuance.

My point wasn’t to discredit Hampton Jr. rather to say that his story is part of the reason I feel disconnected from radical political movements now. I’m sure he doesn’t feel the same way now. His input on the movie was invaluable for getting his father’s message out.

You show a staggering blind spot in your commentary on Korean American political power and political involvement. The Korean people in LA had no support from the ruling class and no support during the riots. Soon Ja Du was let off because the system hates black people, not because the system loves Koreans for having an organized voice. 

The petite bourgeois shop owners are just that. A stratification of the class system that is closer to the proletariat than not. Attacking a Korean grocery store is crabs in a bucket bullshit no matter how you look at it. Calling Koreans neo imperialists is loser talk that you say when you’ve failed your own community. That’s what the hotep Uhuru movement that Fred Jr. was a part of said about Korean immigrants. They hated the Koreans because they participated in capitalism as petite bourgeois. 

The black people in South Central and all over LA that attacked Korean businesses weren’t thinking of their place in the class struggle. They just hated that Korean people shot someone that looked like them and that they had more money than them. The riots were a way to take that money or bring them down to their level. There’s a reason Reginald Denny was dragged from his truck and it’s not because he was a millionaire hedge fund owner. 

Also, if you know your history you know most of the rioting was done by immigrant Mexicans who, over the next decade, became the dominant small business owners in LA; supplanting the Korean immigrants as the petite bourgeois in South Central and once again leaving black people behind. Which really throws a wrench in your universal theory that the petite bourgeois are the enemy of the people.

A large part of the difficulty in building a socialist movement in the American left is due to the fact that black politics has been inherently divisive after people like Fred Hampton Sr., MLK and even Malcolm X were assassinated. The idea of a rainbow coalition largely died with them. As a headless, leaderless, black power movement; BLM has been an abject failure in providing a framework for a unified socialist struggle. It’s literally just become black people pissed at the system, as they always are and should be, and white “allies” saying “black people need a little more attention right now because they’re being target by cops”. No mention of universal healthcare, of paid time off, of collective ownership etc. Just Id Pol writ large. 

Look, I get that you’re a very committed Marxist, Anarchist, Socialist whatever. But you have to realize the movement is largely dead because of actions taken by the federal government and the use of social media by the people which gave rise to leaderless movements built around self identity and faux uniqueness. It’s actually the height of capitalist bullshit to use Twitter to tear down a politician for not being woke enough on the issues of LGBTQIA2S+whatever the fuck.

What you’re saying here is that some people said it was wrong and they still did it as though some people saying that means the issue was decided for everyone. If some people say something we do right now is wrong and we don’t think it’s wrong, should we just stop doing it because they say so?  How do we judge what people should have done, by our own standard? Whoever agreed with our view today? I’m not defending their morality, but this reasoning is pretty bad. You’ve got to have some better standard for this, it can’t just be that not everyone agreed at the time. The founding fathers knew there were people against slavery, so what? I know there are people against eating meat. 

There is no need to excuse the founding fathers. We don’t need to put them on trial for their morality, we also don’t need to worship them.

That is irrelevant if they were pushing for violent revolution, one that the Soviet Union undeniably wanted and supported as a socialist worker led one. Hampton may not have wanted to make the US another SSR but he was supportive of Marxist thinkers and marxist economists. I think you are going out of your way to separate Hamptons' fight for racial equality from his far left socialist economics that called for an economic system much more like the user than the US capitalism.

That is false, you are ignoring Hamptons' pro marxist pro worker ideas and ideology in order push a simple black and white narrative.

The ruling class is not a singular bloc, represented in police protection. The ruling class is the capitalist class and Korean store owners are part of that ruling class. I am not saying that wanton destruction of anyone and everyone not Black is somehow a good thing. Or that people didn't have backward notions. But store owners no doubt exploited the community and the petite bourgeoisie are not sympathetic characters because they are small. I myself have been exploited to a more extreme degree by petite bourgeois aspiring big capitalists who make you think they can sustain a business and then pay you a pittance or nothing. My mother worked for some small business for months without pay. I have little to no sympathy for them.

As to Korean unity, it was not on the level of some tightly knit political party. But it was there, most plainly in that many of the store owners were coordinating defense of their businesses via walkie talkie. And that was backed up by the [Korean Chamber of Commerce on a Korean radio station](https://laist.com/2017/04/28/radio_korea.php):

>This message would be driven home by Kee Whan Ha, then the president of  the Korean American Chamber of Commerce, who demanded to go on-air at  Radio Korea during the riots. [As Ha told NPR in 2012](http://www.npr.org/2012/04/27/151526930/korean-store-owner-on-arming-himself-for-riots),  he was angry that the station was urging residents to return to the  safety of their homes. ""So I know the owner of that Radio Korea, so I  brought my handgun and I put it on the table. I told him that we  established Koreatown,"" said Ha. [As noted at the L.A. Times](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-koreatown-immigration-architecture-20141130s-story.html), Ha would later go on-air to tell the audience, ""Don't go home. Protect your business. Your business is your life.""

Organization and not rioting is ultimately the way forward. But riots happen and taking a simpleminded view that it's not based in real class antagonism is just as detached from reality as those you think failed the community.

Your whole rant about BLM or whatever is pretty weird. But I'm well aware of the [debates](https://www.leftvoice.org/blm-inland-empire-breaks-with-black-lives-matter-global-network) within Black movements right now and [the problems with BLM as an organization](https://www.blmchapterstatement.com/) and movement. A lot of that has to do with the petite bourgeois character of non-profit NGOs like Black Lives Matter the organization.

Many people had backward notions, but attacking businesses was a result of class antagonisms and I think is among the least condemnable actions.

> I also support free healthcare, free higher education, more paid leave, higher minimum wage, stronger worker's rights, blm, common sense police reform, taxing the rich more, and more regulations on corporations in the United States so they favor the workers and consumers more. Many would call those socialist poljicy positions so your assumptions about my views on socialism are also wrong.

These are my views on American policy positions. I said political science and philosophy, not political philosophy. 

I understand leftist economics and economic ""socialism"" isn't an economic school of thought, especially not one that is seriously debated or discussed anywhere in the world. The difference between left and right in the real world is keynsianism vs classical. This is a fact. When you say ""leftist economics"" are you referring to Das Kapital? 

You have done nothing to advance the idea you can see anything in a progressed state and you have not even attempted to articulate this, so I don't wtf you are talking about. I see you make assumption after assumption and communicate in s sloppy generalization using loaded buzz words that are totally removed from actual policy. I honestly think people like you are just hipsters desperately wanting to be associated with some clique psychologically. It makes no sense to discuss policy using the words you do unless you are just trying to come off as edgy and have no real interest in progressing policy discussions or public discourse on these matters.

Who exactly are they unpopular with? Yes, most people are not out burning down small businesses. But I don't think I've argued that as a serious everyday practice or the most productive path. As I said on another post, ultimately organization is the answer. I spend a shit ton of time thinking about organizing and doing organizing.

There is a growing [nationwide (and international) movement](https://atun-rsia.org/) of people [organizing as tenants against landlords](https://shelterforce.org/2020/01/22/tenant-organizing-when-rising-rent-isnt-the-main-issue/), which has been [especially prominent and timely with the pandemic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBOejTN6jQY).
