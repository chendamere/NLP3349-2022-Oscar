"The meaning of Sheriff Bell's dream was that he was ashamed of himself because his fear of death prevented him from doing his duty. In other words: Ed knew the criminal was in the motel room, but his fear of death prevented him from doing his job, which, in this case, was to die honorably in the line of duty.He interprets this moral failure as a desecration of the legacy of his father.This is contrast with the moral failure of Anton: Anton killed the woman who refused to play his coin game, which forced him to assume the moral responsibility for murdering her. This incident is immediately followed with Anton's car accident, which represents him being punished by God and forced to rely on the charity of others for survival. This is why Anton demands the kid take the money in exchange for the shirt - because he recognizes that he's being punished (i.e. he recognizes the charitable symbol and that he doesn't deserve charity) which is an indirect admission of guilt.",1
"I expect a film like 'No Country for Old Men' to be polarizing for some, especially if they're expecting a big finale with the good guy and the bad guy drawing their guns in the end to settle the score. 'No Country for Old Men' is a film that dabbles more in existentialism, despite all the crime that occurs. Basically, what I'm saying is that the film adapted from the novel is very unconventional not only for its genre, but also in its approach to storytelling. What the Coen brothers do best is combining altogether different elements and creating something with its own unique character. While there are subtle throwbacks to the old wild west, the story takes place in modern society where technology has advanced, society has advanced and unfortunately crime has too.What are Anton Chigurh's true motives? Does he have a philosophical doctrine that we the audience are unaware of or are just unable to comprehend? What Anton does is create a lot of questions that arise from his actions and his interactions with the other characters. To watch a character as odd as him is fascinating and I cannot give enough credit to Javier Bardem in portraying such a character that is so enigmatic and just his presence alone is able to evoke so much mystery. Even though Anton is very incomprehensive, it is all made up for by being able to be somehow captivated by him.How every character deals with Anton is interesting, to say the least and as the film progresses, the feeling of despondency increases gradually. The lack of heroes is what gives this film its sense of hopelessness and that feeling of hopelessness is basically set in stone from the first few shots coupled with Tommy Lee Jone's epic voice-over narration in introducing the story. It is the perfect introduction to what we will witness in the story and what it all means for a sheriff like him in comprehending these events. As the events occur, we the audience reflect on these situations just as much as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. Tommy Lee Jones' performance in this role is impressive and is injected with a great sense of humanity. I commend his portrayal as Bell, in that he is the character who carries the weight of the story.The acting is a huge fragment in bringing this film to life, but what also does that is how the visuals are executed and it is definitely utilized to a great effect. From its majestic shots to its beautiful lighting and color tones, the Coen brothers set a mood that permeates the whole film. Its barren settings really add a feeling of desolation that is at the same time hypnotic and surreal. While the film can be suspenseful and its suspense is definitely executed perfectly, the film still somehow manages to maintain an air of mystique. The non-existence of a soundtrack really gives the film a feeling of loneliness, all the while adding an even greater sense of sterility to its already barren wasteland.I can go on and on about the great acting, its memorable shots and its great script, but what makes 'No Country' a great film is that it manages to be truly idiosyncratic in its execution just like how the Coen Brothers' other great films are. Even if a film like this leaves me more questions than answers, if it still manages to captivate me to a point that I'm willing to return to it, then that shows that it doesn't matter if I don't have any answers to my questions. There are only a few films that are able to pull this off naturally and 'No Country for Old Men' is definitely one of those special films that can do just that.",1
"While on a hunting trip, a sportsman (Josh Brolin) finds dead men and a stash of cash in the remote back country of West Texas, the result of a drug deal gone wrong. The greedy hunter takes the cash, but soon discovers that the resourceful criminal responsible for the drug deal, an outlaw named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), has a way of tracking the loot. The hunter thus finds that he is the hunted. Meanwhile, an aging Texas sheriff named Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is after both the sportsman and Chigurh. The story is set in the early 1980s.To some extent, this film is a character study of Sheriff Bell, an honest lawman who is wise, observant, grounded in reality, and has a long memory. ""No Country For Old Men"" is really his story. He doesn't know quite what to make of the drug war that has crossed over from Mexico into Texas; it's something new (for the 1980s); and it makes a land that has always been hostile to settlers even more hostile and dangerous.The film's premise is quite simple, and the story is straightforward with minimal twists. A lot of time and care are taken with procedural actions: loading a gun, dressing a bloody wound, constructing a pole to retrieve a package from an air vent, for example. Dialogue is minimal; there's lots of silence.Overall casting and acting are impressive. I especially liked the performance of Tommy Lee Jones who seemed a natural choice for the role of Sheriff. Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin are also well cast. Several minor roles are extremely well performed, like the store owner who is asked to call a coin toss, and the rotund lady who, with a dour face, defies Chigurh's requests in a characteristic Texas twang.The film's color cinematography is quite good; there are lots of sweeping, wide-angle outdoor shots. I really enjoyed the geographic setting, with that whistling West Texas wind, the silence, and the stunning vistas. It's a landscape that is starkly beautiful. Yet, despite its beauty and wilderness traits, it can quickly turn hostile and unforgiving for anyone unprepared for its hidden risks.""No Country For Old Men"" is a fine film. I'd describe it as a chase story -- character study combo, with elements of noir, especially in the visuals. Violence may be a tad much for some viewers. But given the subject matter, it is entirely appropriate.",1
"Opinions do look to be sharply divided on this typically interesting effort for the Coen brothers. Some hail it a masterpiece, others don't see the appeal at all. While this viewer doesn't quite fit into the former camp, he will say that it's one of the more unconventional examples of crime fiction that one is likely to see. It's much more of a character piece than anything, with some grisly scenes of violence here and there. Based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, it centres around three characters, one being a poor hunter named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who one day stumbles into the aftermath of some drug deal gone horribly wrong. He finds $2 million on the scene and impulsively decides to keep the money for himself, while a mysterious, creepy, sadistic stranger named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) tracks him down, porting a unique pressurized air weapon. Somewhat involved is a weary Texas sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), who's unsettled by what he sees as the changing times. Now, granted, what's going to test the patience of some of the viewers are some of the monologues; this isn't for people who want a straightforward story and who are turned off by philosophical musings. One can hardly fail to notice how low key most of this narrative is; even in the more intense scenes there's never really a sense of urgency. On the plus side, what we do get are some excellent character moments from the solid star trio of Brolin, Bardem, and Jones. The supporting cast is equally impressive - Woody Harrelson, Kelly Macdonald, Garret Dillahunt, Tess Harper, Barry Corbin, Stephen Root, and Beth Grant. The Coens work with some of their reliable prior collaborators such as composer Carter Burwell and cinematographer Roger Deakins. All things considered, ""No Country for Old Men"" may not be to all tastes, and does require some patience on the part of the viewer. It also doesn't resolve itself in the way one might expect for this genre, and might prove to be less than satisfactory in this regard for some of those watching. There's one fantastic confrontation near the end, but the film closes, curiously enough, after a monologue by Bell about a dream he's had. How much or how little all of this works will be up to the individual viewer. In any event, the actors are all fantastic, especially Bardem, and they make the journey worthwhile. Eight out of 10.",1
"No Country for Old Men is as exceptional a mix of two creative talents- the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan Coen, and author Cormac McCarthy (recent winner of the Pulitzer for The Road, his own masterpiece) as one could imagine, as they converge on a story that in lessor hands would be just a B movie. The story concerns an average Joe out hunting one day in Texas who comes across a bunch of dead bodies, heroin, and a satchel with 2 million in cash. He takes it, but without knowing that a true embodiment of a psychopath (Javier Bardem) is on his trail, and as he evades him it becomes more and more clear the fatalism that lies in store, as a weathered sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) is also on the trail with perpetulally sad eyes looking on from his stolid demeanor. More than this, it's also about as good a morality play as one could ask for, because it plays and tools and makes very serious questions about what is moral, or what isn't, or what is so ambiguous that it's all up to the toss of a coin or a chance ride out of town. There are a few interpretations to Bardem's character Anton that could be taken, but one thing is certain- he's less a symbol than a real presence, a ""ghost"" as Jones's sheriff calls him that can come around at the drop of a pin, usually in the dark, and strike the utmost fear (or confusion if you're a clerk) in the hearts of men and women. You'll never look at a coin toss the same way again. Or an air-gun. Or fixing a bullet wound in a leg. Or a hunt at a motel. Or even the aftermath of a car crash.But at the same time it's the purest time of cinema, recalling Hitchcock and Leone and Welles's Touch of Evil and the best of noir and westerns. There are so many exceptional shots and lighting, so much depth to the perception of the characters through the mis-en-scene, so much tension, that through this it's all up to the actors to make or break the near-perfection that is the McCarthy source. Bardem embodies Anton like no other could- you can't look at his eyes, often steel-cold and horrifically professional (to what professional who can say), which occasional tear- and it's obviously worthy of an Oscar. And Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are also fantastic; we see Brolin often in the midst of an action scene, a moment of 'save-your-life' going on, and one can finally see an actor of his caliber completely breaking out in a role that doesn't require him to ever totally ""emote"". Jones, on the other hand, gives a compassionate turn in a film that's about the struggles of desperate men in a land without law and order. He's gone through so much that it comes out completely in his voice and eyes, sorrowful but holding back, and he reaches a level of connection with the character that makes the Fugitive look like simpleton TV. Kelly McDonald, who plays Lleland's wife, is also excellent when called upon, especially in a crucial scene later in the film.It's gut-wrenching, bleak, violent, super-tense (I clenched many a knuckle during some scenes), surprisingly funny in a darkly comic manner not seen by the Coens in many years, and artistically fashioned to a beat that is meditative (watch the opening moments with Jones's voice-over), simple, and doomed. It's beautiful and terribly tragic, for McCarthy fans it finally strikes at what is truest to his material- even if you haven't read the book itself the Road will give an indication of the mood and atmosphere at hand- and at the moment I can't think of any other film that would be the best pick of the year- maybe one of the best films I've ever seen.",1
"If this doesn't end my year in the top two films of the year then we are in for one hell of an awesome year of movies.The new film from two of the best filmmakers working today No Country For Old Men shows the talents of the Coen Brothers on top form. After a couple of disappointments (Intolerable Cruelty had flashes of Coen genius but felt more of a Coen imitation than the real thing; Ladykillers had the odd funny moment but was the blandest film the brothers ever made, and there's just no excusing Marlon Wayans!) they knock this violent western drama out of the park.More in the vein of their superb early mostly-serious efforts Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing (my personal favourite of the Coen back catalogue) No Country For Old Men is a slow-moving, character-driven masterpiece about uncompromising and uncompromised characters. It is very violent and bloody and not always for the squeamish.Shot through with moments of humour these come, as in life, from real situations and observations so don't be fooled into thinking this will be the serious film with goofy-characters Coens of Fargo. No Country For Old Men is a tough, gritty story.The unrelenting pace may take its time but you are gripped every moment. This is a thriller that genuinely thrills.Javier Bardem gives the best performance of his career. And, yes, I have seen The Sea Inside and he in superb in that but here he is simply extraordinary. It is a portrayal of unrelenting evil, of true derangement, of a human being with no shreds of humanity that ranks at the very top of studied film psychopaths. And I say film not movie because this is not a clichéd character. This is not a character whose lunacy you enjoy over popcorn. This is one of the most frightening performances ever committed to celluloid. I felt truly nervous of what was going to happen every time he walked on screen.Josh Brolin essentially carries the bulk of the movie and he is excellent in a role that challenges him. I have never seen him perform to this level and if Bardem didn't steal the film you'd be talking about Brolin all the way home. As it is this gives him a showcase for his talents that should see him get a lot more attention.Tommy Lee Jones is used sparingly but to great effect. Sounding more like Michael Parks than ever before his scenes pepper the movie with a wearied view on a world he doesn't really like or understand to great effect.I did find Stephen Root a little distracting as i have never seen him in a serious role before and he just looks amusing but he is in very little.Roger Deakins' cinematography is breathtaking as usual and the Coens' script is superbly crafted. There are moments, almost asides from the main plot, that would be superfluous in most scripts and excised in most studio films but which work perfectly in the overall context of the movie as only the Coens can achieve. One scene featuring Bardem in a gas station is up there with the best scenes i have ever seen on film.I have not gone into the plot here because I saw this film having not read Cormac McCarthy novel and knowing little other than the basic log-line - a man out hunting comes upon a scene of dead bodies, guns, drugs and money on the Mexican border and comes to the attention of both those behind the scene and a local world-wearied sheriff - and i think that's the way to see this film.Go in knowing as little as you can but knowing at least this: this is a serious, violent, slow-paced character piece from the Coens. This is not a Fargo. If you are squeamish don't see it. If you have a short-attention span don't see it. If you only love the Coens for their fantastic comedies like O Brother and Big Lebowski and the comedy/thriller Fargo don't see it. But if you want to see an intelligent, superbly acted, powerful, beautiful cinematic treat that will remind you of the true power of cinema see it, see it, see it. It's a masterpiece. Bravo Ethan and Joel.",1
"Days after seeing it, I am still haunted by No Country for Old Men. There is just something so effectual and uncompromising about it, that mere words will only begin to skim the surface of the cinematic excellence on display.At its most simplistic, the film is a game of cat and mouse. The mouse here is Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a hunter who stumbles upon two million in cash after a drug deal gone wrong, and takes it thinking nothing of it. He tries to cover his tracks, but ends up letting the group looking for the money, figure out his identity. The cat is Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a hit-man hired to find Moss and the money. But Chigurh is unconventional at best; he also happens to be bordering on mentally insane. And another man, a law man this time, Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), is on the trail of both men as they criss-cross around Texas.Right up until its dénouement, the film is simply brilliant. Taut and thrilling, it blows right through the majority of its two hour runtime with ease. Even during moments of slowing down, the film stays right on track and never feels like it has run its course. It engages even when it appears that nothing is happening. The Coen Brothers truly crafted what appears at first glance to be a masterpiece, even if it is their first real shot at something that is not indelibly and inarguably their own. Even without reading Cormac McCarthy's novel, I know that the Coens have done it justice, even with their bitterly twisted and dark sense of humour scattered throughout the film.But all of that comes to a standstill as the film concludes. The last twenty or so minutes feel like hours as the film wraps itself up, and it almost feels like these scenes belong to another movie entirely (one that borders on being pretentious and monotonous). I realize now that McCarthy's novel probably ends the same way, but it does not help provide closure to the fact that the movie is so break-neck paced right up until this happens. Its brilliance is shattered by what looks to be a series of tattered events thrown together to provide closure for all of the characters, alive or dead, and for its audience. It speaks volumes to the film's title, but it just does not feel satisfying compared to the rest of what we saw. Even with its enigmatic devices at play, I still cannot come to terms with how the film closes. It does haunt, and in a way, it may prove to be a significantly stronger ending as time rolls on. But as it stands now, it just feels weak.What is also a bit of a surprise, and only seems to appear as the film concludes, is the music. It is not so obvious at first, but the majority of the film is audibly shown with just the sounds the characters make and no background music to speak of. This element is brilliantly used, as it helps intensify every situation and makes the film downright terrifying in some cases. It just helps truly make the film come together, and only helps establish the quick pacing even more so. It was definitely a surprise, and one that will probably help the lasting impact of the film become even stronger.The lush and bloodsoaked visuals also help to define the film. Despite the film taking place mainly in deserted areas, or the desert itself, the camera manages to capture just the right essence of what the writing and acting is conveying. The isolation and the terror almost become characters themselves through these visuals, and are sure to be recognized as the award season rolls in.The film's acting is also very well done. Brolin anchors the film and even when it is just the audience reacting to his attempts at saving his life, he manages to deliver the best performance of his career. He breathes life into Moss, and truly brings a sense of pathos to the character. We feel for him and his greedy mistake, and as he develops into a man unwilling to go down without a fight, he only manages to up the ante for himself countlessly. Jones, as the law man stuck on the fringe of every event, also does very well for himself. Most of his work is simply delivering dialogue, but it is delivered in such a fashionable sense that you feel like he is speaking to the bigger picture of things, and not just himself. I would have liked a bit more development in his character, but what little there is helps his performance greatly.Supporting turns from Woody Harrelson and Kelly Macdonald are also done well, but are overshadowed by the main cast by both Brolin and Jones.And even more of an overcast is Bardem as the ruthless Chigurh. He absolutely nails this character down to his very bones. If anyone is merely toying with the idea of seeing the film, it should be specifically for Bardem. His performance is calculating and plagued with petrifying silence. When he chooses to talk, his words sound like they are being given by the essence of evil. This is a man with a plan, but it is one that only belongs to him. His enigmatic presence is developed throughout the film, and never once does it feel particularly appropriate to understand where this menace comes from. Watching him on screen is a jolt to the heart, and will go down as one of the best performances of the decade. His terrible hair only helps to make his character that more scary and formidable.No Country for Old Men is one of the best pictures of the year, even if it is flawed. Its brilliance and lasting impact with leave you haunted.8.5/10.",1
"Joel and Ethan Coen know how to tell a story -- sometimes its meaning is obscure, sometimes it's in your face, but it's always fascinating.In the obscure category is ""No Country for Old Men,"" from 2007, starring Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Woody Harrelson, and Barry Corbin.What I'm going to write next will mystify many. In a funny way, this film reminded me of Psycho. Here's why - in Psycho, we're led to believe that it's a story about a woman who steals money from her employer. Then she stops at the Bates Motel, and the story changes.Same deal here. This starts off as a story of a man who steals money he finds at a drug deal gone wrong, and we believe we're watching him trying to escape the man chasing him. Turns out the movie isn't really about that.In Texas in 1980, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) discovers the scene of a drug deal gone terribly wrong - the ground is peppered with dead bodies. Also laying around unattended is 2 million dollars, which Moss takes.As a result, a man named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is after him. Chigurh kills just about anybody who crosses his path. Moss is on the run, and Chigurh is close behind every step of the way.The sheriff, Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), has become discouraged by the evil in the world and his helplessness in the face of it. Nevertheless, he tries to beat Chigurh to Moss, all the while realizing the job has just about burned him out. It is, in fact, no country for old men.The film is symbolic of evil in human form (Chigurh) coming up against a decent man (Moss) and how it brings about his ruin. Moss' ego and arrogance make him think he can overcome Chigurh's pure evil. His innate goodness compels him to return with water for the one dying drug dealer at the scene, putting Chigurh on his trail when he finds his truck. Temptation, as in the Garden of Eden, can lead to ruin.All the men involved in the story -- Chigurh, Moss, Bell, and an old man whom Bell visits, Ellis - are all fatalists. Moral weakness allows the gods to wreak havoc. Llewellyn brings his fate on himself, and the fate can't be stopped. And so much that happens seems to happen by chance, as the result of a coin toss -- for someone like Bell, looking for meaning, there is no meaning to be found.The Coen Brothers take the western genre and turn it on its boots - we don't witness some of the deaths, and we don't witness the classic good versus evil fight. With Sheriff Bell's retirement, it seems that we are to conclude that evil wins. But the Coen Brothers leave us with hope, as long as we don't depend on mankind for it. Like Bell's dream about his father going ahead and starting a fire for him, the hope is outside of ourselves and our world. As we've seen in court cases, there is no getting of justice in this world. At the end of his dream, Bell says, ""I woke up,"" as we all must.A remarkable film by remarkable filmmakers, demanding multiple viewings.",1
"No Country for Old Men is for the kind of film fan who remarks, ""Gee, wasn't that murder a clever mise-en-scene?"" and who asks, ""What kind of lens do you think they used in that strangulation shot?"" The skeleton of ""No Country for Old Men"" is a cheap, 78-minute, gun-monster-chase B movie. Javier Bardem plays Anton Chigurh, the monster. He is Frankenstein; he is Max Cady from ""Cape Fear;"" he is from your childhood nightmares. He may be death personified.One of many completely implausible scenes: an arresting officer, defying any logic, turns his back on Chigurh. Chigurh, displaying the supple sinuosity of a Cirque du Soleil contortionist, or an orangutan, slips out of his handcuffs. This is done out of camera view, because for Bardem it would be impossible; thus the scene's implausibility. Chigurh then, in real time, strangles the young police officer to death on camera. This is an extended sequence. This is the payoff for ""No Country for Old Men"": watching one human being kill other human beings, in scene after scene after scene, using various weapons, including a captive bolt pistol usually used on livestock. Guess Chigurh couldn't get hold of a Texas chainsaw. This is a slasher flick for the pretentious.Early on, there are well-done, if standard, chase scenes. A man outruns a car: not believable, but fun to watch. A pit bull chases this fleeing man down a whitewater river. The man reloads his gun at the very last moment (of course) and shoots the pit bull dead just as it is about to sink its teeth into the man. Later, in a hotel, a beeping transponder informs the killer where his prey hides. Your pulse may race and you may think that this is all leading up to something interesting. You will be disappointed.Tommy Lee Jones, whose ear lobes appear to be metastasizing as he ages, wanders aimlessly through the film as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, delivering cornpone, homespun, cowboy poet ruminations that are more or less opaque in meaning. No doubt the film's fans are even now feverishly compiling a companion volume that decodes Bell's dreams and conveys their depth.Woody Harrelson, late the bartender of the TV sitcom ""Cheers,"" shows up for a completely pointless half-hour role that yanks the viewer right out of the movie. ""What is Woody Harrelson doing here?"" Some years back, some bored English majors decided that conventional narrative structure was not intellectual enuf, and decided to play games with narrative. ""No Country for Old Men"" plays these sorts of games. The viewer is invited to invest time getting to know characters who are eliminated from the plot in ways that convey no meaning and are not moving. The narrative flow is truncated and yet the movie keeps going; viewers ask themselves why the movie is continuing -- sometimes out loud, even in a movie theater -- this is supposed to be a deep, intellectual experience. It is not. It is merely annoying.Other than bratty English major head games, pretty much the entire substance of ""No Country for Old Men"" is a series of murders and tortures committed by Chigurh, who may symbolize your high school's worst bully  a bully so terrifying exactly because he targeted English majors. His victims are often courteous; their likability makes watching them be humiliated and then murdered an uncomfortable, and, given the film's structure, ultimately pointless exercise. Not only are the Coen Brothers torturing their characters, they also torment their ticket-buying audiences.Chigurh's nice victims are often poor, rural, Southern, whites, the kind of people often not featured as positive, lead characters in Hollywood entertainments. They are often villains  witness films like ""Deliverance."" Here they are murder victims. Chigurh is associated with Mexicans, part of a rising ""dismal tide,"" as one Anglo character puts it. No matter how you feel about immigration, you may find this association of Mexicans with a rising tide of evil to be offensive.The film's boosters insist that the movie offers three deep and shocking lessons: life doesn't always follow a neat narrative structure; evil often triumphs; and the old days were more peaceful and, nowadays, things are getting really bad. In truth, everyone walking in to the theater already knows the first two ""lessons."" No one needs the Coen brothers to inform him that life doesn't always follow a neat narrative structure, or that evil often triumphs. We expect filmmakers, and all artists, to offer us a more substantial thesis. As for the third ""lesson,"" that the old days were more peaceful and things are getting really bad today -- have the Coens, or Cormac McCarthy, heard of Attila the Hun, or any number of other less-than-peaceful and courteous personages from our common human past? One might well be dubious about ""No Country""'s ""lessons."" Visit internet discussion boards devoted to this movie, and you will find fans asking, not ""What is fate?"" or ""What is the role of a good man in a bad world?"" but questions like, ""If Hannibal Lector and Anton Chigurh were locked in a room, who would come out alive?"" Given such reflections, one is safe in concluding that the appeal of this film is its emphasis on graphic violence, rather than on any more advanced intellectual or artistic merit.",1
"No Country For Old Men (2007)' has a tangible grit to it; you can almost feel the very fabric of the film itself. It's a calm and methodical meditation on the changing nature of both crime itself and the world at large (with a focus on America, in particular). It maintains its slow pace even during its bluntly violent action sequences, which are often genuinely intense. The piece is surprisingly suspenseful, providing proper thrills alongside its pseudo philosophical pondering. It doesn't spoon-feed you anything; you have to work to understand its plot and, even, characters, which are both relatively elusive and purposefully amoral. The flick makes no judgements on its players, even though some are truly despicable, and it doesn't provide easy explanations or motivations for some of their actions. This makes for an engaging experience that encourages rather deep thinking. The movie isn't as straightforward as its pretty by-the-numbers set-up would suggest. It undercuts itself at, arguably, its most important moment, subverting expectation with an unconventional yet shockingly effective final third. It really is brilliant. The film feels substantial, a resonant commentary on the ever-evolving yet always cyclical nature of violence and the pure randomness of fate. It stays with you for quite a while after it's over, both providing in-the-moment excitement and provoking retroactive reflection. It's a confident and considered affair right from the start. It's wonderful. 9/10.",1
"I don't remember being so scared in a movie theater since ""Don't Look Now"" Here the Coen Brothers take everything a step further with exhilarating ease. The terror was genuine and not because we were rooting for Josh Brolin or anybody in particular. The terror was personal, Joel and Ethan Coen made that terror visceral and tangible. It has to do with our own nightmares. Josh Brolin was a perfect piece of casting because in a way he doesn't have many personal colors. He's one of the bunch, one of us and we could put ourselves in his shoes. That is the art of film narrative expressed in a way that we've never experienced before. I heard people old enough to have seen Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" in the theaters and what glued them to the screen was their own fear. Well, that's what I've experienced here. Javier Bardem is superb, considering that he's the reason for the fear. He carries a human/inhuman kind of strength and we know he'll get us, sooner or later and if we consider the ending of the film, he might still do. Worthy Oscar winners, all of it and all of them.",1
"Based on the Cormac McCarthy novel, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MAN is quite simply a joy to watch, as it continually frustrates our expectations of what kind of movie it is expected to be. Set in Texas, New Mexico and Mexico itself, it is a western that isn't a western; a chase film in which bad guy Anton Chigurh (Javier Badem) pursues Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), while being himself pursued by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones). One of those chases is resolved; the other is left hanging in the air. The film builds up a fair amount of suspense, as we wonder whether Chigurh and Bell are going to get their men, yet the Coen Brothers continually combine that suspense with an eye for telling detail, or the inclusion of quirky sequences designed to show the futility of the entire quest theme. One of my favorite quirky sequences takes place in a dirty roadside motel, where the camera cuts to a sign outside saying (""HBO Available""). The whole notion of cable television in this kind of motel seems particularly incongruous. The performances are simply brilliant: Bardem doesn't have a lot to say, but communicates everything through telling glances. By contrast Brolin seems more laid back, despite the fact that he is being continually pursued. Jones goes through the motions of ensuring that justice should be done, but seems to be looking for a quiet life all the time. It is significant that the dramatic tension slackens somewhat during his sequences. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is the kind of movie that befits repeated viewings in order to uncover its subtleties. A true modern classic.",1
"I hadn't seen this since it was in cinemas, and found that it's even better than I'd remembered. It's a very unusually-paced film, with a lot of long silences, seemingly-innocuous conversations and dangling plot threads that don't ultimately lead anywhere. In many instances that could make for some infuriating viewing, but in the Coen brothers' hands it all somehow comes together into a master tapestry. The word of the day is suspense, an emotion the brothers have excelled at in the past, and No Country is a glorious example of it at play. The film's three protagonists, retiring sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), stone-cold killer Chigurh (a terrifying, star-making turn for Javier Bardem) and land-living cowboy Moss (Josh Brolin), never actually meet face-to-face but the wake of ripples left in their dueling pursuits is enough to power several movies' worth of rich, intriguing material. Sweaty, intense action walks lockstep with outstanding characterization, top-notch dialog and a hearty dose of respect for the novel. Like many Coen classics, it gets better with each subsequent viewing.",1
"Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) laments the bygone peaceful times of his father and grandfather. Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is a weird killer with a compressed air pistol. Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) comes across a drug deal gone wrong in the desert. The bad guys killed each other leaving the drugs behind. Llewelyn recovers a suitcase full of cash. He doesn't even tell his wife Carla Jean Moss (Kelly Macdonald) at first. He returns to the desert that night, and is shot by the criminals. They have his car and he expects them to come after him. He sends his wife away while he tries to hide the $2 million. Chigurh is brought in to track down the money and promptly kills the drug criminals who hired him. Sheriff Bell and deputy Wendell (Garret Dillahunt) investigates. The cartel hires Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) to stop Chigurh and get back the money.Javier Bardem creates a memorable villain. The Coen brothers have brilliant eyes for such uniqueness. They are also great movie makers. Their movies are always well put together. Every scene is something interesting. And the actors are in great hands with such well-drawn compelling characters. The brothers have done it again.",1
"No Country for Old Men (2007) *** 1/2 (out of 4) A hunter (Josh Brolin) comes across a group of trucks with dead bodies everywhere and discovers $2 million in cash, which he takes. Soon a psychotic killer (Javier Bardem) is after him while a local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) tries to figure out what's going on. I'll start off by saying that I'm not a big fan of the Coen brothers. With that out of the way, this is certainly the best movie I've seen from them but it goes downhill very quickly in the final thirty-minutes, which are quite horrid to be honest. However, everything before that is masterfully done with a beautiful craft that makes this familiar story come off very original, dark and at times funny. I really enjoyed the slow pace that the film carries but I'm not sure if that's how I should describe it. The movie has plenty of graphic violence and action and what makes it so shocking is that it usually comes out of no where or happens when you don't expect it. The pace of the film is slow but this helps when the violence breaks out. The performances are all terrific with Bardem stealing the show as the psychotic killer. Whenever he's on screen you can't take your eyes off of him and his silent performance speaks more than any words could. I was also very impressed with Brolin who I'm usually hit and miss on. Woody Harrelson has a few nice scenes and Tommy Lee Jones is the old Tommy Lee Jones we all love. The film was a lot of fun until the conclusion, which I thought was quite awful.",1
"If you're a Coen brothers fan, you're gonna be extremely delighted with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. This is Ethan and Joel at the pinnacle of their directing careers, something that should not be missed by anyone interested in film or entertainment. Forget FARGO. Push aside THE BIG LEBOWSKI. Move over O' BROTHER WHERE ART THOU. No Country is leaps and bounds beyond those. In fact, it reigns supreme as 2007's best film.I don't always agree with movie critics but this time they got it right. It is the first time that Associated Press reviewers David Germain and Christy Lemire have both selected the same film as their #1 pick. With more award nominations than you could shake a stick at (including four Golden Globes, three Screen Actors Guilds, probably a gaggle of Oscars and many, many, many others), No Country will undeniably have directors, actors and screenwriters jumping up on stage come awards ceremony time.Equal parts thriller, western, crime-drama, and action, No Country weaves a tapestry of excellence throughout its length.The first note of excellence must be directed at Spanish actor Javier Bardem. Probably not very well known to most American audiences, Javier has cemented himself as the leader in portraying a psychopathic killer and (dare I say it!) has surpassed that of Anthony Hopkins in his SILENCE OF THE LAMBS Hannibal Lecter role (something that I thought would never happen). Ruthless, unforgiving, sociopathic, and in desperate need of a new hair style, Anton Chigurh (Bardem) is flawless. Every time he showed up on-screen I felt a chill run through my bones (""Call it""). Absolutely perfect.The next note of excellence must go to Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones. Llewelyn Moss (Brolin, PLANET TERROR) is the lucky/unlucky soft-spoken Texas cowpoke/hunter who stumbles across a veritable fortune in drug money only to be relentlessly pursued by killer Anton. Mr. Moss' gradual decline in health (mainly due to wounds inflicted on him by Anton) is painful to watch up until the very end. Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is the opposite of Anton Chigurh. He doesn't understand all of the death and destruction laid at his feet. He longs for a time when murders were easy to track and solve, not these new-fangled deaths where bullets aren't used (air-guns do just fine) and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to their patterns.The fourth (perhaps this should've been first) note of excellence goes to the Coen brothers for their perfect adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel by the same name. Many lines of dialogue were lifted verbatim from the novel itself, including the ending monologue by Tommy Lee. It's noteworthy to mention here that the Coen brothers not only directed but wrote the screenplay, too.The final note has to go Cinematographer Roger Deakins (he's worked with the Coen brothers on many occasions and also did the exemplary JARHEAD work). Every scene was so well thought-out and so convincingly filmed that viewers are carried freakishly easy through this incredible story.It's difficult to do justice to this film with one short review, simply because there are so many great elements to it. The casting was spectacular  with Woody Harrelson (NORTH COUNTRY) and Kelly Macdonald (THE GIRL IN THE CAFÉ) pulling in exceptional supporting roles  as was Carter Burwell's haunting original musical score and Mary Zophres impeccable costume designs.If you missed this film at your local cineplex, you may have gypped yourself from experiencing this amazing cinematic event. Now you've gotta wait for the DVD to be released and then ...it's your call.",1
"There's very little ""good"" in No Country for Old Men beyond the mesmerizing acting and viciously dark screenplay. Instead, the unholy trinity of temptation, cynicism and pure, dark, evil take center stage in this modern western directed by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen.Based on the 2003 novel by Cormac McCarthy, the movie unfolds in the dusty Texas borderlands as hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon the remnants of a desert drug deal gone bad, complete with a case containing two million dollars. Succumbing to temptation, Moss makes off with the money setting in motion a chain of events that leaves a trail of blood spattered carnage across the State as he is pursued by the ruthless, coin tossing hit man Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) among whose killing weapons of choice is a pneumatic air gun.Bearing little in common with pretty much any previous Coen film with the possible exception of Blood Simple, No Country for Old Men is a dark, bleak, ode to the baser elements of the human soul, and a spit in the eye to the noble ones as well.With a structural trademark hinging upon breaking the conventional norms of predictability, No Country is a movie that will unsettle you at successive turns - in the way deaths are dealt out; by its palpable tension that can almost be cut with a knife, and its periodic deviations from the narrative norm  the latter likely the only Coen brothers ""quirk"" for which their movies are renown.Switching back and forth between the game of cat and mouse being played out by Moss and Chigurh and the investigation of unfolding events by cynical aging Texas Sheriff Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), the Coens weave a web of dangled threads that one can't help but expect will be neatly tied together at story's end, only to tie them up in ways that buck the storytelling norm and manage to be both unsatisfying and true to their nature at the same time.Unforgettable among this tableau is Bardem's Chigurh. The Spanish actor who has also appeared in Love in the Time of Cholera and Goya's Ghosts evokes the most amazing presence of a ruthless killer with his own twisted adherence to a bizarre code of ethics that nothing short of witnessing his performance can do it justice.Sadly, however, justice is one of the few items in abundance in this movie. And yet, as unhappy as I am that the Coen's screenplay defiantly refuses to cater to the audience's inherent desire for satisfaction, I grudgingly have to admire them for opting for the unpredictable.Consider the movie akin to one big coin toss  will it be heads or tales? Call it - you've been calling it your entire life.",1
"No Country for Old Men won four Academy Awards in 2007, including Best Picture and Best Director(s). Despite the critical acclaim, the Coen Brother's adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel was probably a bit of a head-scratcher to many people.The film's narrative begins in familiar fashion, introducing you to the main characters and setting up the plot using recognized, established filmic devices. Llewelyn Moss stumbles upon a suitcase filled with cash and wants to keep it for himself. Anton Chigurh is the sociopath who will stop at nothing to get the cash back. Ed Bell is the Sheriff tasked with bringing Chigurh to justice and, it is presumed, keeping Moss and his wife, Carla Jean, from danger. In addition, there's a corporate backer, a hired gun, and a Mexican gang who are also after the cash (i.e., the McGuffin). So much for the usual narrative elements.When the film continues far beyond the point that the expected narrative structure breaks down, viewers are left to grasp at what the film is actually about. What, if anything, is this film trying to say?I propose that the film is, among other things, a meditation on the impotence of human and divine systems of justice in light of unflinching, unrelenting, random, radical evil. There are a number of elements in the film that indicate such a meditation, but one need not look much further than the meditations of Sheriff Bell, whose words begin and end the film. Consider:""There was this boy I sent to the 'lectric chair at Huntsville Hill here a while back. My arrest and my testimony. He killt a fourteen-year-old girl. Papers said it was a crime of passion but he told me there wasn't any passion to it. Told me that he'd been planning to kill somebody for about as long as he could remember. Said that if they turned him out he'd do it again. Said he knew he was going to hell. 'Be there in about fifteen minutes'. I don't know what to make of that. I sure don't. The crime you see now, it's hard to even take its measure."" With these words, the film's ""story line"" unfolds, with Sheriff Bell trying, and failing, to be effective.At the end of the film, the retired Sheriff Bell describes a dream to his wife:""It was like {my father and I} was both back in older times and I was on horseback going' through the mountains of a night. Going' through this pass in the mountains. It was cold and there was snow on the ground and he rode past me and kept on going'. Never said nothing' going' by. He just rode on past... and he had his blanket wrapped around him and his head down and when he rode past I seen he was carryin' fire in a horn the way people used to do and I could see the horn from the light inside of it. 'Bout the color of the moon. And in the dream I knew that he was going' on ahead and he was fixin' to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold, and I knew that whenever I got there he would be there. And then I woke up."" The film is nihilistic in both structure and content. If you would like to force a less despairing ending, Bell's dream could be interpreted as a ray of hope: a light shines in the darkness! On the other hand, it is a dream that he wakes up from.I don't know what to make of that. I sure don't. But that doesn't mean I can't try.",1
"No Country for Old Men is one of those rare movies for which I do not have any remark. The buildup and the tension that the Cohen brothers managed to craft is amazing and the film keeps you constantly on the verge. You always wonder which is the next move of Chigurh, which is the strategy of Moss to avoid getting killed. All the events are so well connected and especially believable. Nothing feels forced or out of the place.Characters are amazing. Anton is cold and ingenious. He is extremely calm, while he performs his hits, a perfect psychopath, that really scared me for his behavior. Javier Bardem gave an excellent performance and this role just fit him like a glove. Tommy Lee Jones plays the sheriff of a small town, where basically nothing really bad happens, and despite his skills, he decides to avoid the main investigation because he does not want any kind of responsability or pressure. His acting is just on point, as he speaks with the accent of the county. The whole cast is composed by grade A actors such as Woody Herrelson or Josh Brolin. They have completely nailed it.After more than 10 years, this product is still one of the most beautiful crime stories: the script is extremely solid, I never felt bored or annoyed by some scenes or characters. This is how a film should be made, if you want to keep your audience invested. I definitely recommend watching it. Beware though: there are tons of violent and explicit scenes.",1
"No Country for Old Men is not necessarily the Coen Brothers' best movie, I consider Barton Fink, Fargo, Miller's Crossing and The Big Lebowski better. However it is a great movie, I'd go as far to say it is my definition of a flawed masterpiece(the only other movie I've given that definition to is The Magnificent Ambersons). So why do I call it a flawed masterpiece rather than a masterpiece full stop? Well actually right up to the last twenty minutes, the film was the latter rather than the former. If the last twenty minutes had not felt like a completely different movie, it would've stayed like that. As is the case with all the Coen Brothers' movies, No Country for Old Men is very well made with impressive cinematography, editing and settings. The story is compelling, the direction superb and the script most of the time taut, funny, thrilling and exciting. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are excellent in this film, but if I have to give an award to best performance of the film, it would be Javier Bardem in a villainous role that is menacing and chillingly effective. Overall, a great movie but due to the final twenty minutes it just loses out to that extra something. 9/10 Bethany Cox",1
"This was an exciting chase/suspense/character movie until about the half way mark. At that point, too much was going on, all of it similar and all of it almost beyond comprehension. There seemed to an endless supply of Mexican drug runners be to killed. Where they came from, with whom they were affiliated, what they were trying to do, were all insufficiently explicated-if at all. The end of the movie is, IMHO, just a disintegration-as if all the money or film stock ran out. Some attempt is made to present the point that this film is an existential exercise showing what I would call nickle and dime existentialism.Yeah, yeah, we're all going to die. evil exists, life is a coin toss. This philosophizing didn't help.",1
"No Country for Old Men is the Coen Bros' adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel from almost 10 years ago. This film won 4 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and while I have doubts to say this is my favorite film of the year and not ""There Will Be Blood"", there is no denying that ""No Country for Old Men"" is among the finest the year 2007 had to offer. The movie runs for slightly over 2 hours, with credits, and takes us into the world of Llewelyn Moss who finds a huge amount of money. For almost the entire movie, he is on the run from contract killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem, Oscar winner) with Tommy Lee Jones playing Ed Tom Bell, a sheriff who, on the other hand, is trying to help Moss and catch Chigurh. Woody Harrelson and Kelly McDonald play important characters too.It has always been the Coens' strength to include characters in their movies who may be minor, but are still very memorable. Their recent movie ""Inside Llewyn Davis"", my favorite from the brothers, is a great example of that, but this film here is as well. Garret Dilahunt playing a sheriff's assistant was as fun to watch as Kathy Lamkin's one-minute, one-scene character: ""We can't give out no information."" This scene actually gave out a nice piece of information on Chigurh. I don't think he let her live because there was somebody else when we hear the noise of somebody flushing the toilet. He is not scared of attracting attention in other scenes by killing several people in the same location. I think he was impressed by how much of a professional the woman was, even in the face of such a dangerous man like him, so she did not even have to go through his coin toss procedure. Actually, Chigurh and women is a chapter interesting enough to write a full article about on its own. For example, he offered Carla Jean the chance to live at the end, even if he promised Llewelyn otherwise. And then there is that ""You married into it."" scene of course.In general, this film is packed with tense, brilliantly atmospheric material from start to finish, be it the dog chase scene, the scene when we see Chigurh turn out the lights in the hallway as he knew Moss would see him, the scene with Chigurh and Bell almost facing each other or the final monologue by Tommy Lee Jones' character. I have heard about interpretations Chigurh and Bell are actually the same person. There are some indicators that it may be true, especially the face-off I just mentioned, but who knows. In general, my personal perception is still that it is not the case. That's entirely subjective though. In any case, the Coen's created one of the most memorable villains in film history here (with the help of McCarthy, of course). The way they used Chigurh's coin as a depiction of luck and fate was simply brilliant and it's very telling that, while Chigurh was always in charge with human enemies following him (he killed most of these), he picked the wrong side of the coin in the end apparently when something completely unexpected happens. But this is what luck and fate is all about. You cannot influence it. Great last scene with Bardem's character for sure. I am truly curious what happens to him next. This scene also makes for a nice parallel with Moss' scene earlier when he pays a lot of money for the jacket (being the somewhat good guy) and Chigurh gets the shirt for free (being the bad guy). Life's not fair. Neither is this movie. But it's very outstanding and a great achievement of filmmaking. Highly recommended.",1
"Not to mention bloated dead bodies of dogs and humans and a ""man who wouldn't die"".""No Country for Old Men"" has Javier Bardem playing Anton Chigurh, a monstrous motive-less killer (unless you count the money, but how does he know about it?) He slides in and out of scenes, you are always chilled but like the clichéd train-wreck victims you see reeling on the side of the road, he never engages you, you never speculate on what made him this way, he is simply a nerveless, passionless cypher.Actually the clichés were too many to count in this truly, truly disappointing effort from the Coen brothers. A police officer turns his back on the monster and is promptly dispatched and of course the monster manages to squeeze bloodily out of his own handcuffs. H'mm. The instrument used to kill by Chigurh is some kind of stun gun with an oxygen tank. Surely to God he could get hands on a gun with a silencer and not have to lug this tank around like some deranged Fred Munster? There is so much blood, the only conclusion I could make was that this was the whole point, raise the barf meter with everyone, show acres of gratuitous violence to draw in the desirable adbash demographic and forget any kind of plot. A slasher film for the pseudo-sophisticated.The movie grabs you early and you think, as you survey a field full of fallen felons (they were involved in a drug heist) discovered by an officer played by Josh Brolin, that this movie is going to unwind a great mystery. You settle in for the denouement.Poor you. You are sidetracked by an absolutely meaningless sub-plot involving Woody Harrelson (another grisly ending) and by Tommy Lee Jones who was left without any relevant script and wanders cynically in and out of scenes, delivering tired old witticisms as a sheriff. We can count the ways and days of tired old cynical sheriffs. I was waiting for ""life is just a box of chocolates and Chigurh the hardboiled candy"". It would have improved things.I was baffled as to the narrative. Was there one? Why didn't I get it? Was this movie, in spite of the barrels of blood, too deep for me? I was asking myself these questions long before it was over.Was this movie reaching for pretension or was it truly in the stratum of the intellectual elite? Coin toss answer.For me, it seemed fitting that there was no ending to this. No plot should equal a no ending. The beast didn't die and went on his stumbling way. All the good guys died, apart from aforementioned slow-drawl sheriff, who is now retired.Zero artistic merit, zero plot. I gave it a 1 to bring down the over-rating. I still like Tommy, Josh gave a great perforance but I'm going to be really leery of future Coen efforts.",1
"We are such a fragile race, so affected by the shifts of a societal breeze. A child misinterprets what she sees and brings about the destruction of people she actually loves. So caught up in her dramatic wants and angry, she lies, and that lie haunts her for her remaining days. This is a movie version of a wonderful book, the best I read that year. It captures the pain and the need to make true restitution. The truth of the matter is that sometimes it just doesn't work that way. The characters come to realize that. It's a slice of life in wartime and all the chickens come home to roost. Probably the most gut wrenching thing is that the character that causes the most damage has great success in life, but carries around her guilt to her dying day. She is never allowed to truly enjoy things. This is a really fine movie and, except for some breaks in editing, does a nice job of presenting the issues in the novel.",1
"Atonement is structurally comparable to a three-act play, with a brief epilogue. The three central characters are Briony, the younger daughter of the wealthy Tallis family, her older sister Cecilia and Robbie Turner, Cecilia's childhood friend. Robbie is from a humble social background (his mother is one of the family's servants), but academically brilliant, and Mr Tallis has paid for him to be educated through grammar school and Cambridge, where he has obtained a First. A brilliant future seemingly awaits him, in whatever profession he chooses, and he wants to pursue a career in medicine. Act I begins like an upper-class comedy of manners. The setting is the Tallis family's stately home, on a hot summer's day in 1935. Briony, a precocious thirteen-year-old with ambitions to be a writer, has written a play to be performed by herself and her three cousins, but this project proves abortive due to disagreements between them. Robbie has fallen in love with Cecilia and accidentally sends her a sexually explicit love-letter. In other circumstances this might have resulted in disgrace, but as Cecilia returns his passion the accident seems to have been a happy one. The tone of the film changes abruptly, however, when Briony's cousin Lola is sexually assaulted. Lola cannot identify her assailant, but Briony, who was a witness, falsely accuses Robbie. As a result, he is convicted of attempted rape and sent to prison. In Act II, set in 1940, Robbie, released from jail, is now a soldier with the British Army in France. He is desperately trying to reach Dunkirk ahead of the advancing Germans, kept going not by fighting spirit or patriotism, but by the hope of returning to Cecilia, who has stood by him throughout his trial and imprisonment, becoming estranged from her family as a result. In Act III we see Briony, now eighteen, as a volunteer nurse in a London hospital. It is in this Act that the theme of atonement comes to the fore. Briony is starting to have doubts about her identification of Robbie as Lola's attacker, so much so that she offers to withdraw her previous testimony and help him clear his name. Her decision to work as a nurse rather than go to university and to devote herself to caring for the wounded can also be seen as an attempt to atone for the part she played in blighting the life of an innocent man and in tearing her family apart.After ""The Last King of Scotland"" and ""Becoming Jane"", James McEvoy is the rising male star of the British cinema, and his performance here is the best yet that I have seen. Whereas Dr Garrigan in ""The Last King"" was morally flawed, and Lefroy in ""Becoming Jane"" hid his better nature beneath a roguish exterior, Robbie is unambiguously heroic. McEvoy succeeds in conveying his character's basic decency, achieving the difficult task of making him good without making him seem dull. Keira Knightley is another rising British star, and this is her second film with director Joe Wright after ""Pride and Prejudice"". Although she was good in the comedy ""Bend it like Beckham"", I think that her films with Wright are her best, suggesting that her future lies with serious drama rather than popcorn epics like ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" in which she seemed miscast. Her Cecilia was not only the loveliest, but also the liveliest and most spirited heroine of any film I have seen recently. Special mentions must also go to Saoirse Ronan as the young Briony and to Vanessa Redgrave who plays the now-elderly Briony in the epilogue, set in 1999. I felt, however, that Romola Garai, at 25, was too old as the eighteen-year-old Briony. This was only Wright's second feature film, and he has already established himself as an accomplished director. ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a good film, but ""Atonement"" is better. Ian McEwan's book is among the best novels of recent years, and I doubt if any cinematic treatment could capture all its nuances. One of its themes in particular, the debate between literary traditionalism and modernism, seems beyond the scope of any visual medium, and Wright and the scriptwriter Christopher Hampton wisely steer clear of it. Hampton, who has turned the book into a very good screenplay, keeps McEwan's final twist, although it is here presented in a different way, with Briony revealing the truth in an TV interview. If, however, the film does not capture all the literary nuances of the novel, Wright makes up for this with his extraordinary visual imagination, something sometimes lacking in films based upon novels. ""Atonement"" joins that list of films (""Far from Heaven"" and ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" are other examples that come to mind) where almost every scene seems composed like a painting. This is true not only of Act I, set in that beautiful stately home (actually Stokesay Court in Shropshire), but also of Act II, where Wright can find a terrible beauty even in war, especially in the scenes of the burning town and that long shot of the Dunkirk beaches in the grey morning light. Particularly moving was the scene where the British soldiers sing ""Dear Lord and Father of Mankind"". The second line of John Greenleaf Whittier's hymn is, of course, ""Forgive Our Foolish Ways""- a particularly apt comment on war, and perhaps on the behaviour of some of the characters.Also very good was Dario Marianelli's musical score, which (appropriately for a film in which writing plays an important part) incorporated the sound of typewriter keys tapping. Altogether an excellent film- I can only hope that its British origins and late summer (traditionally blockbuster season) release date will not prejudice the Academy against it when it comes to next year's Oscars. 9/10",1
"Comprising recognisable, realistic and outstandingly beautiful performances, set within an uncomfortably believable and heartbreakingly tragic story, it will leave a mark, a scar, a wound on your soul; especially if you have an ounce of humanity, understanding and empathy for the circumstances within which it is told.",1
"The first third of ""Atonement"" is superb. We are introduced to a group of affluent English aristocrats whiling away their summer hours at a massive estate. One of them, Cecilia (Keira Knightley), is nursing a raging case of sexual attraction to her childhood friend and now family gardener, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), while another, Cecilia's young sister Briony (Saoirse Ronan), spends her day writing a play which she plans to perform for a family gathering later that evening. Everyone is bored and listless in the summer heat. Briony, prey to an overactive imagination, keeps witnessing a series of increasingly serious moments of intimacy between Cecilia and Robbie that she isn't old enough to fully understand, and finally a false accusation by her is responsible for sending Robbie away from the estate in handcuffs. Everything about this part of the film is brilliant. The director Joe Wright ratchets the sexual tension to an almost unbearable pitch, and I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen.But then the story and movie switched gears, and it lost some of that narrative momentum it had been so wonderfully building. The second and third acts of the film, while accomplished, do not deliver on the promise set up in the film's first part, and the movie never really succeeded in sucking me back in. When we next see Robbie, he's wandering through the desolate battlefields of WWII France, pining for Cecilia and nursing a chest wound. Wright shows off mightily in this part of the film; there's an astounding ten-minute tracking shot that depicts the allied forces on the beach of Dunkirk that will have cineastes slobbering. But like Robbie's mind, this part of the film starts to wander aimlessly, and even while I was admiring the sheer planning that went into this amazing shot, I couldn't help but wish that Wright would just get on with it already.Finally, the film circles back to Briony, four years older and working as a nurse tending to the wounded. She's suffering a tremendous amount of guilt for the wrongs she's only now beginning to understand and wants to reach out to Cecilia (from whom she's now estranged) and Robbie to offer her apologies. I've not read the Iam McEwan novel on which this film is based, but even I could tell that this is where the screenwriter, Christopher Hampton, had the most trouble adapting the novel to the screen. Much of what ""Atonement"" is about becomes clear in this last act, as Briony ages into Vanessa Redgrave, a successful novelist who has finally written a novel that works as an outlet for her devastating feelings of guilt. We begin to realize here that ""Atonement"" isn't as much about the love affair between Cecilia and Robbie as it is about the act of writing and the power of words. Briony learns as a little girl how difficult words are to take back once they've been said; as an adult, she learns the ability of words to help us deal with regret. One particular scene that takes place between Cecilia, Robbie and Briony is a fiction inserted into their story by Briony the novelist; it's the story as she wishes it had been rather than as it actually was. Briony the woman can't change the past, but Briony the novelist can.This is a wonderful idea, but unfortunately the screenplay doesn't quite know how to communicate this in cinematic terms, so it's told directly to the audience by Redgrave in a monologue at the film's conclusion. Redgrave is a luminous actress, but her soliloquy feels awkwardly inserted into the film. As for the other actors, they all do fine work. The young actress Saoirse Ronan is especially good, and James McAvoy proves further that he's becoming one of the finest young actors working today. But the screenplay sort of abandons him and Knightley after its first half hour or so to a warmed over version of ""The English Patient,"" and the strong impact they both make early on dissipates gradually.I admired ""Atonement"" for how it looked and the ideas it had to express, but I think it's an uneven film that doesn't entirely work.Grade: B+",1
"I deeply appreciate Atonement for other reasons and while the films are about 10 years apart I am utterly perplexed by how Nolan's Dunkirk became the critical darling it is, especially since this film exists. This film isn't about the evacuation of Dunkirk or WWII (those elements form the background for a fully realized troubled romance and family drama) and YET this film spends about 20 minutes on Dunkirk and it conveys the horror, defeat and dread of it it far sharper and more resonant than Nolan's film does for its entire run time. There is a one very long shot of soldiers on the beach that even manages to capture the whole what is time when facing your death thing better than Nolan's film.With that being said I most appreciate the soft, luminous cinematography and the very atypical score in this film. Indeed atypical flourishes-the split perspective, the inserted fiction within the narrative, what's being atoned for etc.-greatly elevate a sweeping romance that might have been too conventional if the film played it straight up. It is really the details-sometimes as small as word choice-that really make this film a ravishing epic.Doomed romances rest on their casting and I can say that both Knightley and McAvoy don't disappoint. McAvoy especially is really sexy, beautiful and emotional in this in that perfectly restrained British way. It may be his career best performance. Good film. It is much better than No Country for Old Men.",1
"I wouldn't necessarily believe everything Briony tells you. She's rather fanciful. - Cecilia TallisJoe Wright directs ""Atonement"", a film based on a novel by Ian McEwan. The plot? In 1935, the thirteen year old daughter of a wealthy family, Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), falsely accuses a servant's son, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), of sexually abusing a teenage girl. Turner is arrested and jailed for this alleged crime. This arrest tears Robbie away from Briony's older sister, Cecilia (Keira Knightley), a woman whom he loves. ""Atonement's"" first half is mostly excellent. Stylishly directed, the film watches as Briony misreads the adult world around her. To her naive eyes, the sexual tension between Cecilia and Robbie thus constitutes a ""perversion"". A ""perversion"" which Briony decides makes Robbie a ""sex maniac"" and so ""rapist"". That adults readily believe Briony's story speaks to the inequities and injustices of Britain's firmly entrenched class system. At the half-way mark, though, ""Atonement"" morphs into another film. Here Robbie joins the army, is sent to France, fights in World War 2, sees many horrors, assembles in Dunkirk with thousands of other soldiers and dies of septicaemia. All the while, Robbie and Cecilia pine for one another. Deeply in love, they're never reunited. Briony blames herself for this. The film closes with Briony, now an elderly woman, writing a fantastical novel in which Robbie and Cecilia live ""happily ever after"", a gesture which Briony hopes will exonerate Robbie and so atone for her lies. ""Atonement's"" second half is mostly kitsch. Tastelessly voluptuous, the film unfolds like a bad David Lean movie (""Brief Encounter"", ""Doctor Zhivago"", ""Ryan's Daughter""), every moment straining for unwarranted grandeur. By the time Wright hits us with his virtuosic Dunkirk sequence – an elaborate long take that seems pulled from Jancso's ""The Red and the White"" - it's hard not to laugh. The film has stopped being about people and problems, and started being about expensively dressed clichés. Robbie and Cecilia aren't just a couple of lovers, but a monument to every tragically wronged couple. They aren't just torn apart, but torn apart by WAR, ruined by RAPE and separated by OCEANS! Because the elderly Briony is suffering from ""vascular dementia"", and because the younger Briony is a childish romantic, Wright assumes that his aesthetic, which is florid, fantastical and at times unreliable (the film's soundtrack contains a feverishly typing typewriter), is befitting. Wright's film, after-all, is the very hokey novel Briony is writing. But self-conscious kitsch is still kitsch. More importantly, though McEwan's prose was similarly overwrought, he was parodying readers who yearn for kitsch. Wright, in contrast, is dead serious; he genuinely loves kitsch.Virtually all of McEwan's books find adults and children losing their innocence after encountering some traumatic event. Consider ""The Child in Time"", in which a missing child shatters a couple's domestic existence. Consider too ""Enduring Love"", in which a balloon accident torments a middle-aged couple, and ""The Cement Garden"", in which children cover up and deal with the deaths of their parents.McEwan's lead characters also typically carry a corruptive secret which gradually expels them from their families or communities. Be it pregnancies, rapes, illicit romances or murders, his characters tortuously conceal this secret, only to cathartically release it during the novel's climax. We see this in ""Atonement"". But Briony's crime is not simply that she is a liar and bad novelist, but that she acts like a novelist at all. For McEwan, Briony is guilty of creating fiction. She is guilty of storytelling, which is seen to be inherently corrupt and corrupting. This resolutely postmodern theme – the unreliability of ""art"" and its inability to convey the ""whole truth"" – has long been McEwan's pet obsession. As such, McEwan's novel persecutes both Briony and his readers for their compulsive need to tidy up life's messiness with familiar plots and neat resolutions. Time and time again, McEwan condemns the limiting projections of artists, the trite desires of readers and demonstrates the implications of fictionality. The result is a novel, like Nabokov's ""Lolita"", which attempts to comment on its obvious falsity (its construction as fiction, and the dangers this masks), whilst at the same time trying to convey ""reality"". None of this is captured in Wright's ""Atonement"", which works primarily as an old-fashioned tale of love interuptus. 6/10 – Worth one viewing. See any film by Atom Egoyan for this material done better.",1
"My brain tends to turn to mush in the presence of greatness. This makes it difficult when I want to write about something that I thought was truly great. It is so much easier to write about something that is rubbish.Oh, well. Here goes.I thought that ""Atonement"" was terrific. It is a really great movie. Obviously it is early days yet, and there are a lot of contenders still to appear, but ""Atonement"" might just be the winner-in-waiting of the Best Film Oscar in 2008. Put your money on it now.""Atonement"" is pure poetry on film. From the hazy, dreamy, hopeful days of 1935, a destructive act of spite, the horrors of Dunkirk (with one of the most fantastic long takes I have seen in a cinema for a very long), to the aftermath and a devastating ""happy"" ending, it is a magnificent and moving film, beautifully directed by Joe Wright.I have never really rated Keira Knightley or understood her popularity. Except for her role in ""Pride & Prejudice"" (for which she was perfectly cast) I have tended to refer to her as Girl-Who-Would-Be-Winslet, as I thought that she had not played a single role that Kate Winslet could not have done better. Maybe I won't say that anymore. ""Atonement"" is easily the best thing Keira Knightley has done.Keira Knightley has had a lot of the press over here, but we should not forget to mention the pitch perfect performances from James McAvoy and Romola Garai. They share as much screen time as La Knightley and are as impressive.Wonderful film.Gushing over.",1
"13-year-old Briony Tallis is a girl with a huge imagination who loves to write. The film starts at her completion of a play, ""The Trials of Arabella"", a morality tale on love and the dangers of being too hasty with one's emotions. From her opening line in the prologue, various multisyllabic words that I didn't understand were employed, and the audience giggles at her pretension: evidently, this is a girl whose world is shaped with words, regardless of whether or not she understands them. Witnessing her sister Cecilia dive into a pool as their housekeeper's son Robbie watches after her, Briony pictures as scene she has no understanding of, and, by the end of the day, she will have changed lives for the worse, and she will spend the rest of her life regretting and trying to atone this mistake.The first act of the film, set in the picturesque country house, effectively conveys the sweltering heat of the British Summer and the mental unrest that comes with it. The camera never stays still, and cinematographer Seamus McGarvey even used Christian Dior stockings over the lenses to portray the heat and its effects on the residents. As Briony starts thinking about what she doesn't understand, trying to write a play of it, Dario Marianelli's haunting score, which features the rhythmic tapping of typewriter keys, reverberates in the background, to continually remind the audience that something bad is about to happen. The dramatic quality of the film is heightened with different events are replayed from different perspectives to show what something has the appearance of being, and what it really is. This device, though not new, works excellently for Atonement.The second act of the film, set 4 years later, is much grittier and less pretty to watch. Robbie is now a soldier in France, and pines to get back to Cecelia. The horrors of war are not underplayed, and in one excellently-filmed tracking shot, the camera meanders through a chaotic mess of soldiers. Robbie, who had turned out so well before, has not lost practically all of his beauty, and retains only his accent. Similarly, back at home, soldiers with all sorts of disturbing injuries are shown. It is refreshing to see a film that, rather than portraying the war as some sort of patriotic honour, instead shows the horror and suffering that it causes.In what could only be a nod to David Lean with his country houses, upper middle classes and epic romances, Joe Wright chose for his actors to give performances of the pre-Lee Strasburg era. And the cast rise up to the challenge admirably. As the young Briony, Saoirse Ronan is pitch-perfect, conveying her youthful innocence as well as whiny nosiness. Her sense of knowing about things she clearly doesn't is infuriating, but Ronan prevents us from denouncing her entirely, reminding us that she is, after all, just a child. Keira Knightley, who will be keen to forget her ""performance"" in her other 2007 venture, Pirates of the Caribbean III, doesn't do anything majorly wrong here, and at times even earns the audience's respect and sympathies as the loyal lover. Romola Garai plays the older, more wise Briony with conviction and a touch of sadness.But the star of the show is the one, the only, James McAvoy. In the Q&A that followed the screening of the film, director Joe Wright described Robbie as the highest form of a human being, and he is. Even after he is put in the war to avoid staying in prison for longer, he does not whinge about it, but instead, gets through the day with the hope of seeing Cecelia guiding him through. James McAvoy plays this special individual with compassion and understanding. He has the accent and physicality of Robbie down to a T, but, more importantly, conveys his goodness, without ever having to resort to histrionics. McAvoy's performance is a masterclass in subtle acting. In some pivotal scenes, it is actually his beautiful blue eyes that do the acting more than anything, and they speak more words than Briony's ostentatious prose ever could.There is more than a little similarity between Atonement and The Go-Between. Both tell of love between different classes, and an intruding message carrier between the two. Furthermore, Sarah Greenwood's sensuous set design (in the first act) and accurate war holes (in the second), along with the sound design, which features buzzing bees, works cleverly on a subconscious level to add to the tension. Indeed, Atonement is a technically and visually stunning film. The hues in the first act are almost overly saturated with richness, and this contrasts starkly to the second act, where cold hospital wards and mucky brown war dugouts fill the screen. The costumes are all realistic and accurate, though I personally favour the glamorous designs of the first half, which include a mesmerizing green dress that Cecelia wears. The cinematography, which encompasses long takes, tracking shots, lingering pans all attribute to the visual flair of the movie. But the key stylistic element that stood out for me, was the score. The piano theme is elegiac and melancholy, and the cello and violins also add to the sadness of the romance. Also, the use of a typewriter as an instrument, though started oddly, soon becomes infectious and it even forces its way into viewer's minds, making Robbie's note (and the consequences) unforgettable.Joe Wright and Working Title have made a film to be proud of. Amidst some incredible scenes (such as an extremely erotic library non-reading session between Robbie and Cecelia). The quality and calibre of films that Working Title have turned out recently have been brilliant (Pride & Prejudice, Hot Fuzz, etc) and Atonement ranks up there along with my personal favourites Dead Man Walking and The Hudsucker Proxy. It is a wonderfully crafted, beautifully lush and immensely moving film that shows, above all, how storytelling can both destroy and heal.",1
"Its very rare that a movie like Atonement comes along and leaves me completely speechless and in complete and utter awe for hours after I have seen it. You see Atonement isn't just the best movie I have seen all year, its one of the best movies I have seen in a very, very long time. And by that I include Pan's Labyrinth, yes this movie is better than my favourite movie of 2006, and I never imagined Atonement would ever come close to that level of greatness until fifteen minutes into the movie last night. Atonement is an unusual movie, in fact its fair to say that I have never seen anything quite like it. Its a rare movie that actually I adored so much that I am going to hunt down a copy of the book tomorrow just to see the comparisons. Its not an easy movie I'll be honest, if you go in expecting something light hearted and easy to digest then you will leave the cinema feeling very cheated. This is a movie that deals with very dark things at times. No matter how much I desire to write in depth about every aspect of the movie I just can't, the movies greatest triumph is the fact that its plot is so intricately woven that if you ruin one part of the storyline to anyone then the movies impact is slightly lessened. The storyline is just brilliant, but its the climax that leaves you in store for the biggest shocker, and its this shocker that leaves you reeling long after you have left the cinema. The performances here are all spectacular, I think its fair to say that the two leads, James McAvoy and Keira Knightly shall be receiving at the very least nominations for Best Actor/Best Actress. The score is beautiful, whoever came up with the idea of using a typewriter as a musical instrument deserves to be praised heavily. Its rare a score leaves me feeling moved, the score in this movie did that for me. That's yet another Oscar that this movie deserves to win. All in all Atonement is just perfection, I doubt you'll find a better movie this year or even for the next three years. In a time when Blockbusters get all the attention it is nice to see a small, but intelligent movie leave me in awe.As I previously mentioned the performances in this movie is simply amazing. Keira Knightly is an odd actress, while she proved herself in Pride and Prejudice, yes I have unfortunately seen that movie, she comes across as a wooden actress in films like Pirates of the Caribbean. Atonement really sees her at her best yet. Her character is different from what we've seen Knightly play before. Usually she goes for the spunky females, this time she seems more like a proper lady, albeit one that smokes constantly and is a bit stuck up for her own good. Keira Knightly excels in the earlier, more laid back sequences, but its in the later stuff, the more powerful stuff that we see just how talented an actress she truly is. Despite all my praise for Knightly she still plays second fiddle to James McAvoy. The former actor of Shameless and Narnia is on a roll lately. His excellent, although sadly overlooked performance in The Last King of Scotland still sticks firmly in memory. But his performance here is simple breathtaking. One sequence in particular where we see his acting talent come to light has to be the sequence in Dunkirk (more on that later), no words but the performance says everything. Knightly might not be certain to win an Oscar, but McAvoy surely is! Its also refreshing to see a young actress, Saoirse Ronan, not be eye gougingly irritating, but rather a superb actress. Her character, Briony, is a vital character in the movie, and for such a young actress she delivers her performance so chillingly brilliant. Unfortunately next to this brilliant performance, Romola Garai who plays an older Briony pales in comparison. Her performance is still brilliant, but not as effective nor as memorable as the younger actress. The storyline of Atonement is where the film holds most of its impact. Essentialy the film is about a lie that Briony tells, and how it affects the lives of her, Cecilia, and most importantly of all, Robbie. That's pretty much all I can and will say of the storyline. A lot more happens over the course of the movie, and a lot of stuff that you think will happen doesn't, and things you think won't happen will. The ending is a prime example of this and to be honest I didn't see it coming. The way the movie is directed is also something note. The beautiful colours of the summer house are amazing, but the way the camera moves around the house makes it even better. But the direction will be remembered for one scene in this movie, and its in Dunkirk. I mentioned this previously for the performance in that scene, what I failed to mention is that the shot is a continuous shot that lasts five minutes as we see the chaos of Dunkirk. From horses being shot to a man hanging from a ferris wheel, the sequence is shown in all its glory. It really is a powerful moment, and probably the one scene that got me closest to tears, purely because of the singing in the background, it is shocking just how amazing this sequence truly is.Overall Atonement is a perfect movie, in actual fact its a movie with pretty much no flaws whatsoever. Superb performances, beautiful direction, a script and storyline to die for. It is unlikely any film will top this for a very long time, this is something that will go down in cinema history as being a classic, and it highly deserves it inevitable status.",1
"A budding young writer named Briony witnesses an innocent act she doesn't fully understand between her older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and long-time family servant Robbie (James McAvoy) one restless summer day on her family's lavish country estate in 1935 England that leads to scandal in Joe Wright's dreadfully sumptuous adaptation of Ian McEwan's international best-selling novel, ""Atonement."" Four years later, all three characters try to find their own personal sense of peace or redemption during WWII.This brief synopsis does nothing to explain the intricate complexities of the plot and actions that take place. Although Keira Knightley's performance is slightly off-putting due to the fact she appears like she just escaped from a concentration camp (surely young British socialites did not look like this in the 1930's), the stunning cast shows full range here racing through curious emotions: spite, lust, recklessness, and selfish wanton abandon. The facial expressions, especially from the children in the early scenes on the estate, are priceless. None of the characters are particularly sympathetic as they are often vain, self-absorbed, and quite silly in their drama, but they are fascinating to watch. The first third of the film is played like a ""Masterpiece Theater"" production of ""The Great Gatsby"" as seen through the eyes of Nancy Drew.However, what makes ""Atonement"" soar is the impeccable direction of Joe Wright. He makes the most audacious coming-of-age as an auteur since Anthony Minghella delivered ""The English Patient"" back in 1996. Wright displays a near Kubrickian mastery of sound effects (notice the strikes of the typewriter keys) that transition from scene to scene and often bleed into the amazing score from Dario Marianelli. Wright also crafts a finely textured mise-en-scene that visually translates McEwan's richly composed story onto the screen with near note perfect fashion. Nothing can really prepare you for how well directed this film is until you see it, and the scene of the three soldiers arriving on the beach at the Dunkirk evacuation is one of the greatest stand alone unedited panning long shots ever captured on film. It left me gasping.That scene leads to the heart of the film. The often clichéd romance at the core is trumped by Wright's depiction of Robbie, a single man forlorn and obsessed, his dizzying inner turmoil reflected against the grand canvas of a chaotic world at war. Likewise, Briony's redemption comes not in the too-clever conclusion at the end of the film, but in the intimate and symbolic confessional at the bedside of a dying French soldier. These moments leave lasting impressions, and left me imagining that if Joe Wright were to ever adapt Irene Nemiorovsky's ""Suite Francaise"" onto the silver screen, he would knock it so far out of the park it would leave ""Gone With Wind"" spinning in its gilded Hollywood grave.",1
"Atonement (2007) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Keira Knightley and James McAvoy play lovers who's lives are ruined when her younger sister sees them making love but not being able to understand what's going on, the girl tells a lie, which leads to the downfall of all three. I went into this film not knowing a single thing about the story so it took me quite a while to understand what was going on but from that point on the movie had me hooked unlike any love story in recent times. This is a very depressing and at times brutal story that unfolds in a very poetic way and in the end the film works wonders and contains some of the greatest moments I've seen in a movie in quite sometime. One of these scenes is an incredible beautiful shot set on a beach were thousands of soldiers are waiting to be picked up. I'm not sure how long this scene lasts but it plays out as if there are no edits and the epic scale of this scene is quite incredible. The other great scene is the sex/love scene that the little girl mistakes as something else. This is certainly one of the greatest love scenes I've witness from any movie as the true beauty of love comes pouring out in this scene making it very erotic, mystic and emotional. The performances are all wonderful and that includes Knightley who captures the mood and heartbreak of her character. McAvoy steals the film with his tremendous performance. The emotion he brings to the role is something truly great to watch. I think the film will work even better for me on a second viewing since it took me a while to figure out what was going on but leaving the theater I certainly felt as if I had seen something special.",1
"The superb Ian McEwan book translated into cold beautiful images by the startling Joe Wright and scriptwriter Christopher Hampton. The result is a series of powerful rushes and abrupt stops. A pacing that, perhaps, is a bit too self conscious for its own good doesn't help us to connect the emotional dots. I had the feeling I had lost something in the love story of the protagonists - something that didn't happen to me reading the book. By the time the ""injustice"" takes place I was taken by the pain of the injustice but not by Knightley and McAvoy's liaison. Their love story is left to its own devices. The beauty of the images is overwhelming and the assuredness of Joe Wright at his second feature after the, much better, ""Pride and Prejudice"" keeps you going. The score tends to be monotonous and irritating but in spite of all that I intend to see ""Atonement"" again and I would recommend it with just the above mentioned reservations.",1
"With 7 Golden Globe nominations, ""Atonement"" is one of those movies for which the script is important. It is adapted from a novel by Ian McEwan, same as ""Enduring love"" (an impressive performance from Daniel Craig who, incidentally, was a relatively unknown at the time, at least on a global basis). Starting with an innovative use of the sound from a typewriter for percussion with a pulsating urgency, the movie plays out like a concerto with 3 movements.The first part takes place in an ultra plush English country house set in the 1930s. While the backdrop is a typical upstairs-downstairs class-dominated environment, the mood is one of a dark psychological thriller. All the characters are presented here. While 13-year old Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) aspires to be a writer, her sister Cecilia (Kiera Knightley) and gardener's son Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) discover their deep mutual passion that had been bottled up in the last few years. The match is not as unlikely as it appears because Robbie, supported by Cecilia's generous father, is at least her academic, if not social, equal. Without getting into all the details of the other characters and plot, it suffices to say that Briony, driven by an adolescent passion for Robbie and a vicious jealousy that she is probably not fully aware of herself, accuses him falsely of a rape which she claims to have witnessed.The middle movement sees a torturous journey of three English soldiers in France a few years later, winding up at Dunkirk. Robbie has been given a choice of staying in prison or going to the front. What we see is essentially his agonizing experience waiting for the Dunkirk retreat, with flashbacks of scenes with Cecilia as well as Briony.The final movement is told from Briony's POV, when at 18 (Romola Garai), she has given up university to be a wartime nurse. This is the most intriguing part that is not unlike a coda on a theme of realty verses imagination brought out in the first movement. The last 10 minutes of the movie, with Vanessa Redgrave playing Briony in the final days, is a TV interview in which she appears mostly is a facial closeup.The movie is beautifully filmed, with an exquisite art-house flavour, from the dream-like elegance of the British country house to the brutal inferno of the Dunkirk beaches. Both James McAvoy and Keira Knightley got Golden Globe best acting nominations. But they are unlikely to win because the real limelight is on Briony  this is the story of her atonement. Saoirse Ronan got a Golden Globe best supporting nomination and is good enough to win. Romola Garai has taken her career one step forward from ""Scoop"", ""Amazing grace"" and ""Angel"". But it is Vanessa Redgrave's performance that takes the movie to a new height no one else today is able to. In those 10 minutes, we a privileged to a lifetime of excellence.",1
"When ATONEMENT was released in 2007 I made a point not seeing it due to the hype . Critics were falling over themselves to judge the film a "" masterpiece "" and it's interesting that all these critics were British . When it comes to harmless shallow jingoism the British film critics are unique . While some countries have an obscene tradition of murdering people because "" they're not one of us "" the British lovers of art fawn sycophantically over the slightest piece of mediocrity if there's some Anglo-Saxon Celtic connection and since ATONEMENT is set in a pre war 1930s Britain with posh folk we have the archetypal class driven British movie that appeals to jealous egalitarian Americans . It was interesting that the film didn't do very well at the American box office and that despite receiving an avalanche of prestigious nominations it had a very small award from nomination ratio . This tells you something After seeing it after the hype has been dead for several years my impression of it is that on a technical level it is a very impressive film . From the opening scene which involves both sound editing and imaginative camera work there's a lot to impress cinephiles . Perhaps the most impressive aspect is the cinematography by Seamus McGarvey . The way the colours contrast and seduce the audience with an on screen beauty is worthy of the best works of the great Roger Deakins . There's also a scene set on the beaches of Dunkirk where the camera floats around for ten minutes never cutting once which has entered in to legend . One wonders why director Joe Wright wasn't Oscar nominated for this scene alone . Perhaps he was trying too hard to impress ?Unfortunately perhaps it was down to some very clumsy errors on the part of the director that he didn't receive more . As was pointed out at the time the story takes place in 1935 then jumps forward with a caption saying "" Four Years Later "" with the evacuation of Dunkirk which in fact took place in May -June 1940 which every schoolboy of the 1970s would know . This caption can't be defended down to the early segment taking place at the end of 1935 because it's obvious the way people are dressed that it's Summer 1935 . Other irritants involve a Lancaster bomber flying around the skies of 1935 England and a black cockney corporal in the BEF . It's not impossible to have a black cockney in the British army of that time , just unlikely . What would be impossible would be Corporal Mace to be overweight as seen here . Rationing had been introduced and there was little fat in the British diet in those days . Hands up anyone who has seen a photo of a fat person circa 1940 ? Thought not These irritants might be forgivable but one thing that is fundamentally flawed comes from Ian McEwans source novel . Robbie is found guilty of child rape and sentenced to several years in prison . When he is in Northern France he states that he was given a choice to either serve in the army or complete his sentence . In reality this wouldn't have happened in real life since conscription didn't extend to prisoners serving sentences . This becames even more unlikely when we're shown a segment set "" Six Months Earlier "" which would place that event round about Nov/Dec 1939 when Robbie has completed basic training . The truth is for Robbie to have completed basic training he'd have needed to join the army before conscription was introduced in the Autumn of 1939 . Before that the British army was an all voluntarily professional army . This fact makes it doubly implausible for a convicted child rapist to be given a choice between serving a sentence and serving in the military As the title suggests ATONEMENT is a redemption plot but seems poorly translated to screen . The film ends with Briony Tallis on contemporary TV plugging her latest book called Atonement ( Oh Meta-fiction . How wonderfully clever - not ) and stating that the scenes she wrote where she finds a reconcilation between herself on one side and Robbie and Cecillia on the other is total fiction since Robbie died on the beaches of France and Cecillia died in an air raid a few months later . This might have worked on the printed page but comes across as problematic on screen. Put it like this if Robbie was having a death dream that wouldn't be as confusing as what is seen here and you feel somewhat cheated by the way events happen . It's not helped by the fact Briony is a compulsive liar who ruined someone's life . The fact she grew up to be a major successful novelist who will die of old age is another factor that will alienate. Some people are beyond redemption and atonement in its literal ecclesiastical meaning is nonsense to any humanist In all you can understand to a large degree the number of plaudits and prestigious nominations this film received on its release . It is a visual delight for those of us who understand the language of cinema . Conversely you're also to understand why it wasn't able to convert the acclaim in to actual awards . It is very problematic from a narrative point of view and for a film to achieve true greatness you must find some empathy for the protagonists and empathy is in short supply for this film with its clumsy storytelling and characters",1
"I read the book and watched the film recently, and I really liked them both. The book is beautifully written, with flawless narrative detail, though at first it isn't very easy to sink your teeth into. The film on the other hand is beautiful to watch, wonderful cinematography and excellent period detail. The music was quite nostalgic, and I suppose positively hypnotic. The screenplay was wonderful to start with, but the last part's narrative did lose its way a little, and despite the fact that I thought Briony's portrayal was fine on the most part, when she first finds that Lola is being hurt by who she suspects is Robbie, I didn't find her as comforting as she was in the book. The library scene I thought was more believable in the book, it just felt thrown in in the film. I will say, the performances were wonderful, with Kiera Knightly at her loveliest and James McAvoy very handsome and heroic as the two lovers who embark on a complex love relationship. Also worth of note are the performances of two great actresses, Vanessa Redgrave and Harriet Walter, who didn't disappoint here. Atonement is beautifully done, well performed, and fairly faithful as an adaptation. 9/10 Bethany Cox",1
"I usually don't like watching novels turned into movies (specially when I liked the novel as much as I liked McEwan's ""Atonement"") but this was a really pleasant surprise. The plot is extraordinarily well adapted, leaving out what cannot possibly be included in a two-hour film, changing very few details to translate literary language to cinematographic language but sticking to the essence and the spirit of the novel.I really believe that if you enjoyed McEwan's novel, you will fall for this beautiful film. If you have never read McEwan, you will fall for the intriguing and thrilling story written by this wonderful English novelist.Please, don't miss this one!",1
"Atonement: compensation for a wrong.The story is not always linear, but in total spans from around 1934 when Briony Tallis, future author, is around 11, to around 2000 when she is 77, dying, and announces that she has written her last of 21 novels. She says, in a real sense, it is her first since she began thinking of it since she was a young girl. The movie is made mostly from Briony's perspective. Saoirse Ronan is Briony Tallis at age 13, living in a mansion in rural England in 1935. Her older sister is Keira Knightley as Cecilia Tallis. The third member of the ""love triangle"" is James McAvoy as Robbie Turner, son of the Tallis household's maid. He is treated much like a family member and even his schooling is financed by them. His mother is Brenda Blethyn as Grace Turner.Briony is smart and demanding, and fashions herself as an author, writing her first play at 13. But she also is secretly in love with Robbie who just treats her as a younger sister. We see a flashback to when Briony was 11 or 12 (her words) and she jumps into a pond to have him ""save"" her.But Robbie and Cecilia are the ones who really are falling in love with each other. Something happens at a fountain, Briony sees it from afar, doesn't understand what happened, and comes away with a bad feeling against Robbie, partly because in her young mind feels cheated by him. So, when something else comes up later that evening, she takes it out on Robbie and it has a lasting affect.So the rest of the movie is about Briony eventually learning the truth, and doing what she can for atonement, trying to make right her wrong. Good movie, even touching on the conflicts in France in the early 1940s part of WW II. August 2013 update: I just watched it again, it is better than I had remembered it, very good on repeat viewing.SPOILERS: Briony's wrong was naming Robbie as the man she saw that night apparently raping a teenage house guest in the field. As a result Robbie was imprisoned, and after 3 1/2 years got out only because he agreed to enlist in the Army and fight. So his and Cecilia's romance was effectively ended. But later Briony found that the ""rapist"" and the teenager got married, meaning it probably wasn't a rape at all. Unfortunately both Robbie and Cecilia, now a nurse, both died as a result of the war, but in ""atonement"" Briony gave them happiness and a life together in her final book, ""Atonement"", that was the only gift she could give to them, after their deaths.",1
"In 1930s England, Robbie is the son of a cleaning woman who has fallen in love with his mother's master's daughter (his childhood friend). On the same night where they reveal their love to each other, Robbie is accused by the woman's younger sister of a rape he didn't commit. Robbie is sent to jail and off to fight World War II... and for the remainder of the film, the two lovers try to reunite while the younger sister comes to term with the horrible mistake she made that tore her family apart.Let me be honest up front: I had a very minimal interest in this film. I was mildly interested by its Oscar aspirations (7 nominations) and then I was slightly more interested when my friend Chelsea expressed interest (with whom I ended up seeing it). A chick flick starring Keira Knightley (who, to me, is a younger, classier Winona Ryder)? Not my first choice. Although, I went to go see ""I Know Who Killed Me"", so my instincts aren't always he greatest. Anyway, point being -- I saw this film half-heartedly and really liked it.The beginning is really strong and interesting, and surprisingly funny. The involvement of a certain curse word (one of the more notorious ones) plays a big part and was funny in a somewhat awkward way. After the opening, the tone of the film turned decidedly darker... which you'd expect with a film about war and rape, I guess. Emotionally the film runs strong all the way through, working with loneliness and casualties of war (there's a scene later on with a dying French soldier that doesn't shy from showing the realities of war).Worth singling out is a very long continuous shot (maybe 8 or 9 minutes) of English troops on the shores of France. We see troops singing, troops destroying jeeps, troops shooting horses and much more... to get this all in one shot is a major feat. The last long shot I recall is in ""Children of Men"", which ran about maybe 6 minutes but with much less going on to coordinate. The choreographer (or whoever) deserved the Oscar if anyone did, although in the end it only won a single award -- for best original soundtrack (which I don't recall as being a particularly stand-out score).I think the film closed rather weakly after all the quality emotion (I can't really explain more without revealing things). But it's still a good film, only maybe losing a point from this closing. If you're a fan of period pieces or tough romance stories (this is no romantic comedy) this is for you. I don't know if I could watch it again -- it's good enough but a bit emotional. But I'm glad I saw it at least once and you should see it too.",1
"Atonement is being acclaimed now as one of the best films of the year, a surefire contender for the best picture prize at the Oscars (at least, apparently, as a ""proper"" film as opposed to the crime classic No Country for Old Men). It's not hard to understand it, for a good lot of the running time; Joe Wright, the director, has taken what is an apparently beautiful book (unread by me) and transformed it into the stuff of true existential crises. It's about a young girl, Briony, who witnesses what she thought she saw as a crime. This might seem unclear at first, but it isn't, it's a clear move on the part of immediate revenge for a tryst she witnessed between her sister and a worker (Kiera Knightley and James McAvoy). He's sent to prison, then to war, where unforeseen circumstances may change everyone's lives.Doesn't sound like a bad premise, with a good dosage of romance in the mix. And for the first half hour, forty minutes it IS great film-making of a tense nature, focusing on the young girl who just wants to be the center of attention with her first play and is cut-off by family and other matters that flock away. All of this is filmed by Wright, and acted by the case, quite absorbingly, and by the end you really care what will happen to poor Robbie... But then the story takes a turn that only slightly recovers in the last ten or so minutes. Suddenly the point of view changes- which, I suppose, is also true to the book, albeit from what I've heard lopping off some bits and pieces that would have made it a longer but richer film- to Robbie fighting in the war, though not exactly 'fighting'. He walks around a lot, comes across a beach-front of soldiers (in a startling 5 minute long take no less, indulgent but effective), and yet this coupled later with the emergence of the Briony as a nurse doesn't really click for me.Yes, it should be compelling cinema to see Robbie suffering along with all the other British in the midst of the early, rough days of WW2, but what Wright shows us isn't much more compelling (or, for that matter, as well done) as any given number of war pictures of the period done in the present; even a harsh hospital scene with wounded only works so much until it's overkill. When the point of view changes it suffers, and when it finally returns to Brialy it takes some time to get adjusted back in it all (not helped by a nearly too restrained performance by Romola Garai, particularly in dramatic scenes where, whether or not they actually happened, should be believable). I may be in the minority here from the masses who are praising Atonement to the sky, but only when Vanessa Redgrave appears does the film finally offer a satisfying catharsis.It's a sad thing too, because when Atonement is at its best it's what many dramas, particularly those of this kind of period setting, seem to lack in dealing the old love-and-war story. This time real danger, caused by complete human error in youth and judgment, is in the mix, and it provides a level of interest in what will happen to the characters. That Knightly and McAvoy work so well speaks to the director's gifts. I just wished that Wright either made the film longer to make it even more of an epic feat, or knew how to deal with the change in perspective of narrative for a FILM, as opposed to in a novel.",1
"Atonement reminds me of Scorcese's ""Gangs of New York"" in that the director felt compelled to insert a 'second story' into the main narrative. In 'Gangs', there's a whole sequence about the New York Draft Riots which is completely superfluous, tacked on at the end simply because the director was enamored with a particular interesting piece of history. Similarly, in 'Atonement', we're treated to a glimpse of the British Army retreat at Dunkirk which is brilliantly photographed and reminds one of a scene from hell in a Hieronymus Bosch painting. Despite the Dunkirk scene's artfulness, it's all padding and it needs to be there because without it, 'Atonement' would be little more than a specious melodrama about the evils of the British aristocracy. The first hour of Atonement is interminably long. The viewer soon discovers there's very little intellectual substance to this tawdry tale. In a nutshell, Briony, a 13 year old girl in an upper class family becomes jealous of her sister who has suddenly become intimate with Robbie, the housekeeper's son, who lives on their estate. Briony is the Brit version of the 'Bad Seed' but we never really find out what motivates her except for a schoolgirl crush and some unexplained revulsion toward adult sexuality (oh my, upper crust 13 year old snob is just so incredibly repulsed by witnessing her older sister and the housekeeper's son having sex in the library!!!). Speaking of that library scene, do you really believe that Cecilia and Robbie would have sex in the library where anyone could just walk in on them? And what about the crude note Robbie gives to Briony to give to her sister? If he loved her so much, why did he even think of writing that note in the first place and why would he entrust it to Briony (who he could have easily guessed would have looked at it?).Worse than these plot contrivances, is the accusation of rape that lands Robbie in jail. Notice how Cecilia hardly sticks up for Robbie at all as he's hauled away by the police. Wouldn't she have put up a bigger fight or was the whole point that she was cowed by her snobby family? The 'investigation' into the rape lasts about 3 minutes on screen. In real life, many people would have been questioned and various suspects and angles would have been pursued. There's none of that here since 'Atonement' must fit the classic melodramatic mold--an innocent lover (victim Robbie) is broken by Bad Seed victimizer (Briony). At least there is an antagonist--for awhile--but Briony then disappears until the end of the movie, only to reappear (in the imagination) of a now elderly Briony who is working on her ""21st"" and ""last"" novel. The now reinvented Briony is a nurse (who opts not to go to Cambridge) and attempts to atone for her sins by throwing herself into the War effort. And the elderly Briony somehow 'atones' for her indiscretion by creating a fictional denouement: the 18 year old Briony apologizes to Robbie and allows the star-crossed lovers to live out their lives in a picture postcard world at the seashore (this clashes with the not so surprising true ending revealed to us by Briony the novelist that Robbie died at Dunkirk and her sister was killed during the Blitz).Atonement gets high marks for atmosphere and mood. It has some very nifty cinematography and the music enhances the dramatic encounters. The characters here are one-dimensional in that the upper-class Brits are petty despots (the children reflect the parents' hostility) and the working class are hapless victims (exemplified by Robbie and his mother). Atonement becomes another movie in the second half and overall sports two antagonists. The Bad Seed is replaced by the horrors of war. 'Atonement' is an empty vessel. Don't be fooled by all the 'bells and whistles.'",1
"In 1935, in England, the upper class Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) is in love with Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), the gentle son of the caretakers of their real state that will be sent to the medical school by the Tallis. After witnessing an incident between Cecilia and Robbie in the fountain of their property; snoop a letter that Robbie asked her to deliver to Cecilia; and see her sister making love with Robbie in the library, the thirteen year-old aspirant writer Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) misinterprets the events and believes that Robbie is a sex maniac. When her cousin Lola Quincey (Juno Temple) is raped in a hot summer night in the garden of the Tallis real estate, Briony falsely accuses the innocent Robbie and he is sent to prison, affecting the lives of Robbie, Cecilia and their families.The awesome ""Atonement"" is one of the best movies I have ever seen and a sad example of how unfair the Oscar is, since it is better and better than the awarded ""No Country for Old Men"". The wonderful screenplay, based on the British romance novel by Ian McEwan, discloses a magnificent story of atonement of a character that seeks redemption for her unthinkable attitude on the age of thirteen, and is supported by a stunning cast, fantastic cinematography, art direction, costume design and music score. The outstanding performance of the unknown Saoirse Ronan is impressive and her nomination to Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role is more than deserved. In my opinion, the performance of this young actress was superior to the winner and great actress Tilda Swinton in ""Michael Clayton"". My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Desejo e Reparação"" (""Desire and Atonement"")",1
"I was left with a bitter feeling at the end of this movie after hearing the elderly Briony Tallis (Vanessa Redgrave) explain to an interviewer how she manufactured the extended love story between her sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and lover Robbie Turner (James McAvoy). Granted, and while putting things into perspective, young Briony (Saoirse Ronan) at the age of thirteen was not only mistaken in her accusation about Robbie, but was also in a bit of revenge mode after being rebuffed by him after the fountain 'drowning' incident. Her twenty first and final novel was meant to put to rest her conflicted heart over the matter of destroying two lives, but her means of 'atonement' at that point had no conciliatory effect on the way I felt about her character. Would that the relationship between Cecilia and Robbie have turned out the way it did following the war and it's aftermath, but it was all a fiction concocted by the troubled author. In a way, it's a story that never happened, at least as far as the latter half of the picture goes, so it left this viewer feeling as if he had been strung along. I don't think we had closure on chocolate heir Paul Marshall (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Lola Quincey (Juno Temple) either, as their relationship further damned the future of Cecilia and Robbie as well. They could have come forward to contradict Briony's story when she was thirteen without jeopardizing their reputations, although to be fair, Lola was a kid at the time too and was certainly scared about what happened between her and Paul. So ultimately, all thoughts of a tragic love story between the principals was shattered by the end of the picture, leaving me with only a degree of measured contempt for the author who couldn't (or wouldn't) take responsibility when it mattered.",1
"As a thirteen year old girl, Briony Tallis has a passion and creativity that sees her channel her energy into writing novels and plays. Her upper class family live is happy and privileged. However a late night search for two of her young cousins who have gone off by themselves sees Briony stumble across her other young cousin being raped. Briony identifies the attacker as Robbie Turner, the young working class man taken in by her family who is also the new lover of elder sister Cecilia. In one night this accusation rips the family apart, shattering lives perhaps irreparably.I wasn't sure what to expect from Atonement, never having read the book or really knowing much about the story. As a result I found the film to be a rather sumptuous and engaging watch but yet at the same time to be quite unsatisfying in regards the emotional content which I imagine the book must do much better. I imagine this for the simple reason that the film alludes to it and that the book has significantly more time to deliver in this regard. The thing for me is, and I'll jump right into the spoilers here, the film didn't develop and engage me enough for the story to hurt and the ending to crush. I didn't long for Robbie and Cecilia as much as I should have done and as a result I found myself watching the story rather than feeling it. The emotional impact of the ending is undercut by this as well. Without the hurt or anger in the viewer at the news that any happiness in their lives was a complete fantasy comes as a twist more than a punch. The presentation of this twist is also not perfect because for me it came over like it was giving Briony a way of finding her own forgiveness. It is a false atonement though and one given to her by herself to the benefit of nobody else. This sense of pointlessness and loss is not followed through on though and instead we get another ""false"" scene of happiness that seems to be suggesting that Briony has ultimately done the right thing; whereas I felt that she could never have atonement for what she did, whether I wanted her to or not.I might be reading too much into it but that was what I thought and I didn't think that the film delivered that well enough. That said, the story is still engaging and solid. The jumping around within time structure worked surprisingly well and it did hold my interest easily. What makes the film though is the delivery, which is classy and professional in almost all regards. The sets and costumes hit you first because it is very well located and framed; you can feel the heat and relaxed air of the meadow, the stiffness of the dining room and so on. It looks and feels perfect for period and place; some will feel that that the typically English stiffness is a barrier to the film but I did not. The soundtrack is worth noting as well as it builds in the typewriter sound so well that it is present but yet unobtrusive. Wright's direction is excellent and the many touches he employs makes this stand out from being another English period piece. I liked the fades to black in the backgrounds and some other character framing shots that did keep the literary feel. Of course the money shot is the one-take around the crowded beach  an impressive shot from a technical point of view and a real pleasure to watch.The cast is the final area of delivery and of course the running time of the film and the requirements to hook the audience put a lot of pressure on them. I felt that McAvoy stood up to this pressure well and delivers a convincing and heartfelt performance throughout, making me care for his character. Knightley is not as good but she is not Pirates of the Caribbean either. I never felt for her or the pain she carries but yet at other times she is good  the love scene being the most convincing (and another really well delivered scene as well). Ronan is the best of the Briony actresses. I thought that Garai didn't give much away (partly because she is having to play a character as written by that character) and Redgrave, although a strong presence, was treated too well by the film in my opinion.Overall though this is a really well made film that has class dripping from the stylish direction, the score, the set and the performances to name a few. The emotional impact is surprisingly not what it should have been and I thought that the ending was disappointingly touched with hope and forgiveness that I thought was ill-fitting.",1
"I saw a preview of this film yesterday and felt privileged to be one of the first people to see the film. It was also a pleasure to see a film before reading any other critical review or opinion. I am a great fan of Ian Mcewan and was concerned that it would not be possible to capture the subtleties and nuances of Mcewan's writing but I needn't have had any worries. The director, Joe Wright and screenplay writer Christopher Hampton have done a superb job and the complexities of the novel are superbly captured with real imagination. The story is set in three main areas, an English country house in 1935, war torn France 1940 and London 1940. The atmosphere in of all three are wonderfully captured by the director, cinematographer, costume design and score and I am sure that there are going to be some Oscar nominations for these. James McAvoy as lead man gives a tremendous performance of a restrained but passionate man. I was not as convinced by Keira Knightley's performance and am not sure that her acting has the mature edge to capture the social nuances of the times that McAvoy did so successfully. Do not see this film if you like fast paced films and rapid plot development! This is not a film for the pop video generation. If however you like character development and a plot that unravels at a pace that allows you to be immersed in the atmosphere of the film then I can highly recommend Atonement as one of the best films that I have seen this year.",1
"Based on Ian McEwan's award wining novel of the same name, Atonement tells the story of A British romance that spans several decades. Fledgling writer Briony Tallis, as a 13-year-old, irrevocably changes the course of several lives when she accuses her older sister's lover of a crime he did not commit.I've waited several months to see Joe Wright's second feature film ""Atonement"" and it did not disappoint. For an only second feature film by 35 old Joe Wright, it's absolutely astonishing. Directed superbly on all levels. From the stunning Dunkirk visuals, to several Point of view shots empathising each character's need and feelings at that point, you can't help but feel intertwined in the story and with the characters. I haven't seen such an epic of a film since The English Patient, I hope it continues to do well at the box office and worldwide, as it deserved to. I haven't read the novel, so I will do soon.There are many sensational tracking shots in this, which I loved. For instance, in the Dunkirk scene, we walk with Robbie and see the devastation through his eyes, just amazing. At the beginning, Briony's view of Robbie and Celia is done through two perspectives. One being what Briony believe has happened and two the real truth, this creates a dilemma for the audience as you don't really know who to believe at that point. One shot I loved was of Briony's eye, an extreme close-up almost giving a clue to the viewer. As I mentioned before, I can not believe that Wright has produced such a masterpiece of a film, in only his second feature.The Dunkirk, scene is something to be remembered. Watching it at the cinema, I was so taken aback by the extraordinary beauty of the scene. The cinematography is sensational. It captures the mood of that time, so well that you can put yourself in there. What works is that you think what you're seeing is real, and everything in every frame of that scene. I can't really describe the words, as it won't really doesn't do justice to what I thought of the scene but let's just say I'm still thinking about it now and will always. Subsequently that scene has to be up there with some of the best war scenes ever created for the silver screen, and I don't often say that unless it's seriously something that has left me speechless beyond any recognition- that hasn't happened. Some other scenes to mention are; Celia and Briony's estate like house and the scenery and the wartime London are also sensational. Plus, there done in such a way you wouldn't expect a 21st century film to make.As for the acting, that was wonderful from every actor in the picture. Keira Knightly does brilliantly, as she did in Pride and Prejudice, which she deservedly got an Oscar nomination for that. However doing crap films like The Pirates Franchise doesn't do her acting talents any justice. These are the films she should be making as she has the ability to become one of the best British actresses of recent years; she just needs to keep well away from blockbusters. I'm sure she'll gain her 2nd nomination at next years Oscars. However the REAL sensation n this film is James MacAvoy. For me he outshone Knightly on all levels, playing Robbie Turner so, so well that you believed in the character more that Knightly's. I don't quite know how to explain but I'm sure you'll know what I mean when you see it. MacAvoy's performance was so exquisitely done that I almost cried for the first time in a cinema. I'm hopeful MacAvoy will gain his first nomination at the Academy awards. I hope he is in chance of winning one this year, I will jump for joy if he does as he deserves it more than anyone in this film. I must not forget the incredibly supporting cast, from young Saoirse Ronan who brilliantly played Briony aged 13 ,Romola Garai who played Briony aged 18 and the great Vanessa Redgrave(older Briony) who moved me to tears with her final speech at the end. I hope the Academy recognises at least one of those actresses, because they all deserve some recognition.That soundtrack is stunning beyond words. It brilliantly blends in the mood of that period with every scene that you understand what's going on and the scene becomes visually engaging. I'm sure this score will be Oscar nominated! Finally, I'm sure Antonement will be nominated in several category's at the 2008 Academy awards as it should and deserved to. I haven't seen such an outstanding British film as his for a while now. Although The Queen came close last year, Atonement is the one for me. This is a modern masterpiece and will become an instant classic, as did The English Patient did back in 1996. I hope you will all go out and see it when it reaches your local cinema, as you all should. The best film I've seen this year!",1
"When I first heard about this little film I wasn't particularly interested. Being a high school teacher, I wasn't impressed with the idea of seeing a movie concerning a teenage mother. Believe me, I know enough of them already! However, on a lark, I decided to finally watch the film--almost two years after it debuted. And, in hindsight, I should have just gone and seen the film when it came out, as unlike my ASSUMPTION, it was not really a glorification of teen pregnancy but a very complex film--a film with a lot of different messages and possible interpretations. This is definitely NOT a by-the-numbers (formulaic) film--there is a lot that is original and new. And, if you were worried that the film would be pro-teen pregnancy or abortion or whatever and it might offend you, don't think that way....the film is great for anyone, conservative or liberal alike. And, it might just be an excellent film for you to see with your teens. Excellent, simple and very effective.I could say a lot more about the film, but considering the huge number of reviews already and the film came out some time back, I'll be brief and stop here.",1
"Juno is an incredibly cute movie, and for once I don't even mean that in a patronising sense. If the movie universe was some sort of gigantic petting zoo, ""Juno"" would be the adorable little lamb standing in the corner making the jealous other lambs look like death incarnate. It's not a sugary sweet tale by any means, in fact it's a real down to earth kind of story that's not always pretty, but the approach to it couldn't be more right. It's humble, it's little, it's low-budget, and that's exactly what makes it so great. What I also liked about it, hell what I like about a lot of independent movies, is that it's never predictable. There is no formula, you don't know what's coming, you don't sit there quietly ticking of all the clichés: you just enjoy yourself tremendously. Finally, one last addition to the heap of praise and I swear I'll stop: it's been ages since I've seen an ending scene this beautiful. It's exactly the way you want it to be, and the camera zooming out at a barely noticeable speed is a brilliant touch. I quite liked ""Juno"".",1
"The thing that separates ""Juno"" from so many other films about teen pregnancy is that, in this case, the 16-year-old who finds herself in that predicament refuses to become a victim of her circumstances. From the moment she confirms the unwelcome news, Juno studies her options - abortion, raising the child as a single teen parent, adoption - then takes matters into her own hands. Like the Roman goddess who is her namesake, Juno is a bright, often sharp-tongued individual who prides herself on her observant cynicism and her way with a sarcastic quip. However, she's not above appealing to the adults in her life when the problems of the world get to be too much for her (though, in some cases, the grownups are coping with more serious issues than she is). Yet, Juno makes certain that it is she and she alone who will have the final say when it comes to determining the course of her own future and that of her child.""Juno"" is that rare low-budget, independent feature that finds unexpected success in the mainstream by striking a chord of recognition in audiences across the demographic spectrum. First-time screenwriter Diablo Cody hits pay dirt with a clear-eyed, largely unsentimental script that is not afraid to go off in unexpected and interesting directions and that avoids patronizing its Middle American characters. Juno's father and stepmother manage to take the news in stride, while the yuppie couple Juno alights on to be the child's adoptive parents are given a depth and complexity far beyond what a lesser writer might have afforded them. Director Jason Reitman keeps the quirkiness to a minimum and allows the scenes to play out in a naturalistic, unhurried way. Confident in the strength and appeal of his material, he lets the gentle human comedy speak for itself.In a star-making turn, young Ellen Page takes a daring approach to her character, often bringing Juno right to the brink of un-likability, then pulling back at just the crucial moment, making us see how utterly likable she truly is. As the child's father, Michael Cera is virtually the same lovably passive nerd we found so endearing in ""Superbad,"" while J.K. Simmons and especially Allison Janney give rich shadings to Juno's supportive parents. Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner also make their mark as the couple who post their picture in the ""baby wanted"" section of the local throwaway.""Juno"" faces the downside of any independent film that unexpectedly finds itself ripped from the confines of the art houses and suddenly duking it out at the multiplexes with all those high-budget, high-octane, testosterone-laden blockbusters - namely the risk of over-inflated expectations. Thus, my advice is to look beyond all the hype and box office records and simply let ""Juno"" sneak up on and take a hold of you in its own quiet, inimitable fashion. I think it works best that way.",1
"Full disclosure, I would probably see Ellen Page and Jason Bateman in anything, I love them both so much. Page is of course in the starring role here, and delivers an outstanding performance as the quirky Juno, a high school who finds herself pregnant after spontaneous sex with her nerdy friend (Michael Cera). The film is very well made, with clever dialog and composed of countless little moments that are amusing, despite dealing with a serious subject. Juno resolves to give the baby up for adoption to a yuppie couple played by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner, but things get complicated with Bateman's character begins getting close to her because of their interests in rock music and slasher films, kindling long-standing desires on his part to do more in life before becoming a father.This is a very well-cast movie from top to bottom. J.K. Simmons plays Juno's father who is generally kind and supportive, but expresses his disappointment by saying ""I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when"". Page's facial reaction, followed by her response, ""I don't really know what kind of girl I am"" is priceless, and just one of many great scenes for her. Allison Janney plays her step-mom, and has a powerful moment telling off the ultrasound technician while sticking up for Juno, and then later quipping ""doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream"". Cera plays awkward teenage dorkiness naturally, and Olivia Thirlby turns in a solid performance as Juno's friend.This is a 'teenage film' that is smart, and has so many positive messages; it's accepting of unorthodox kids and difficult situations, which everyone deals with as Juno does, with humor and head up high. It's an empowering film, and a love story. The scene of Cera and Page strumming guitars and singing 'Anyone Else But You' (by The Moldy Peaches) is a sweet ending and caps off a nice alternative/indie soundtrack. Page really established herself with this film, and is well worthy of the Academy Award nomination she received.",1
"Look, I do get it. I fully appreciate that a film about a girl who gets pregnant, has an early abortion, then manages to move on, would be a pretty short movie. In fact, so short it wouldn't get made. No one wants to know about reality. And certainly in 21st century North America, no one wants to portray abortion as a viable option. Very, very bad form currently.But when I see this film reviewed as ""blazingly truthful"" and the pregnant 16 year old central character described as being 'in a pickle', as I did in one review, as if perhaps she'd forgotten a homework assignment and might get detention, I have to admit that the cynic who lurks in my soul gets full rein. This is basically a cutesy film about being pregnant at 16, where despite a few problems, everyone gets to live pretty much happily ever after. Gosh, girl in a pickle comes good! Ahhh!! And apparently everyone in the cinema where I saw it was quite overwhelmed by attacks of the warm fuzzies, except me. Two seats away, a woman slightly older than me was weeping joyfully by the end while behind me, young women were giggling happily as sweet Juno's bump grew. Good grief! Is this really a message we want to give to 16 year olds? I'm beginning to think I'm something of an oddity. You see, I don't find it 'blazingly truthful' that a bright, resourceful and articulate 16 year old as Juno is portrayed, would be so dumb as to have inadequately protected sex then seem surprised to find herself up the spout. One point of the script is that Juno herself apparently initiated the sex, thought it through in advance in fact, because she was bored. I therefore assume the pregnancy was at least to some extent planned. And if she really had no idea that sex might lead to pregnancy, her parents (portrayed as bemused but supportive), should be excoriated for such inadequate parenting. And if I see one more review which describes Juno as a comedy about growing up 'and the bumps along the way.' (I'm prepared to bet good money on that having been written by a middle aged man), I swear I'm going to run amok in the local mall with a urine dip stick. Being pregnant at 16 isn't a sweet joke, abortion clinics (whatever you think of their morality - and I'm neutral on that) are not run by morons, and while Juno has some amusing one-liners, and a good central performance from Ellen Page, it is basically a deeply flawed, superficial movie which is trying too hard to be cute. It's extremely manipulative.I'm going to be very controversial and suggest that far from being surprised by an unplanned pregnancy, Juno might actually be a very willful young woman who wants to add pregnancy/childbirth/adoption to her 'experiments-in-living' list. At everyone else's expense. It certainly makes her the center of attention. She wouldn't be the first girl to get pregnant for that reason.I found the situation between the adoptive parents more convincing. Childless Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) is desperate for a baby. Husband Mark is not so sure, and does at least eventually face up to the truth of his uncertainty by making a break for it. He may be 40 going on 18, but he's being honest about it. And for me the most moving scene in the whole film was when Vanessa held the newborn child in her arms for the first time, having decided to go it alone as a mother anyway. If there is a message to be taken from this movie, it's possibly that becoming a mother when the time is right, is just fine. A superficial, cutesy, lightweight movie. The fact it was written by a woman is no excuse. I am gobsmacked that it's been nominated.",1
"This could have been a very, very good film. I enjoyed the basic plot - a quirky, tomboy-ish 16 year old discovers she's pregnant, decides to give the baby up for adoption to the ""perfect couple"" but finds that the perfect couple isn't so perfect - and maybe no relationship ever is.There were also some great moments, and great lines. I like when Juno tells the baby's quirky father, Bleeker (played by Michael Cera) that he is the coolest person she knows, without even trying. And he responds that, actually, he is trying really hard (to be cool).I guess that gets me to the problem with the movie- it's trying waaaaay too hard to be cool (by being quirky - yes I have used this word 3 times already, intentionally). In the beginning, a store clerk sees that Juno's pregnancy test is positive, and he says: ""that's one diddle that can't be undone, home-skillet"". I cringed. As others have mentioned, Juno has an ""ironic"" hamburger phone, wears ""ironic"" t-shirts featuring 70's era toys (Slinky), wears Converse sneakers, and can't seem to have a conversation without making pop-culture references no matter what is going on - even when her water breaks and she is headed to the hospital, she has the detached sense of irony to make a reference to a mid-80's cartoon, yelling: ""Thundercats are go!"" I cringed again. I get it - Juno is a hip, snarky, ironic, tough, cool-because-she-trying-not-to-be-cool chick. But she becomes a cartoon, a warped caricature of an actual quirky kid. I could not accept Juno as ""real"" and was painfully aware that I was watching a movie.And that is my ONLY problem with the film. The other characters and their stories are amazing - particularly the adoptive couple, and the difficulties they are facing. The best parts of the movie are those few moments when Juno gets her uber-ironic self off the screen, and we get to enjoy the other, more realistic, characters.Would have given this a 8.5, if not for the cartoonish-ness of the Juno character. Thundercats are not go.",1
"Juno is funny (nearly every single line of dialogue is written to elicit laughter), directed with at just as sure a hand as ""Thank You For Smoking"".. possibly surer.. and acted gamely by the whole cast -- especially Olvia Thirlby and J.K. Simmons as the title character's galpal and understanding dad. The script, by Diablo Cody, is rich with one-liners; anyone who's read Candy Girl (which is unbelievably intelligent and funny; her description of Shania Twain, especially, had me rolling) will kind of know what to expect.This is without a doubt Ellen Page's show. She's in almost every scene, and I couldn't spot an instalnce when she made a bad decision or timed a delivery anything but dead-on. During a funky, kick azz opening title sequence, Juno is on her way to the pharmacy. ""I just drank my weight in Sunny D, and gotta go, pronto!"" It's time for another pregnancy test, because the last result looked more like a division symbol than a plus sign. New stick: same plus.The father's a guy Juno had sex with once upon a time, who also happens to be her best friend, Paulie Bleeker (a non-affected, quite bland Michael Cera). She decides to give it up for adoption, being 16 and all, which Paulie supports -- as do Juno's father and step-mom -- and the rest of the film is about her selection of adoptive parents.Pretty straightforward storytelling, but with an ear for quirky, hip dialogue. If the spoken words were any more ""cool"", or the actors speaking them did so with any less suave, my gag reflex might have taken over. The AFF audience I saw it with, last Sunday, couldn't get enough from the second Juno tells a dog to shut up, through lines comparing babies to iPods and Alison Janney going off on a physician.There's good stuff, here. And even though it never really swept me off my feet, the film is consistently humorous and, in one scene near the end, somewhat heartbreaking.",1
"This is a well produced, well directed, well written and extremely well acted film. Its essentially a one woman show, and Ellen Page becomes a star with this picture, or at least she should.So why am I not jumping on the bandwagon? Its a game played with a stacked deck and that turns out to be its downfall.Juno is a 16 year old high school girl who gets pregnant after a single sexual encounter with her boyfriend of sorts, Paulie. Does Juno panic? Not on your life. Juno is smart as a whip, adventurous and once she decides to have the baby, she sets out on her own to find proper adoptive parts. The first family she visits turns out to be a rich yuppie couple who seem fine and they strike a deal. After a few doubts, Juno winds up having her baby and turns the child over to the rather rigid and somewhat frigid Jennifer Garner, who probably takes the kid right home and registers him for the right pre-school.The problem with this whole thing is that Juno encounters virtually zero problems along the way. She is not kicked out of school or ostracized by her classmates, her parents are supportive, the boyfriend doesn't disappear on her and the adoptive couple, while facing their own problems, don't turn out to be too bad.So essentially, what we have is the after school special about teen pregnancy, or one of a thousand Lifetime channel stories on the same topic, but minus most of the conflict. Its also minus what seems to me to be the real life emotion 16 year old girls would go through if this happened to them, and any of the self doubt that goes with the decision to give up their baby.Lastly comes the question of whether any sixteen year old would be as self assured and well rounded as this girl? It's possible, but rare.As such, the picture is worth seeing for Page's performance, but Juno is not exactly what you'd call high drama.",1
"Following all of the hype, it was impossible for me to not want to see Juno. Everyone has raved about it for months, and I waited patiently for it to be released somewhere nearby. And the wait definitely made it worthwhile.Juno chronicles the story of the titular sixteen-year-old girl (played by Ellen Page), and the fallout of her accidental pregnancy. After deciding to not have an abortion, Juno decides that she will give the baby up for adoption to would-be parents Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) after finding an ad in the local classified section of the newspaper.It may not sound like a deep film, but right from moment one, the film draws you into Juno's bizarre world of teenage angst and wonderment. It progresses through the stages of her pregnancy (and the seasons that pass), and through the various problems and issues that arise as a result of the pregnancy.This is aided almost exclusively by the commanding presence of Page. Her work here is simply astounding, and watching her mature as the film goes on is the stuff of movie magic. She plays Juno with a chip on her shoulder, and a keen sense of tongue in cheek. She is very in tune with the role, and even though it is not wholly original, she makes it her own and gives it a grand sense of earnestness (and pathos when needed). She plays it even better during the more hormonal aspects of the pregnancy, and she makes her undeniable mark on the movie-going public as she does. After seeing her intense, calculating and downright terrifying work in Hard Candy, I knew that she would be a presence to be reckoned with. And in seeing Juno, I now know that she truly will continue to grow into a great actress.Supporting turns from just about everyone only further complement Page's terrific acting. Garner and Bateman, while not as well written as Page, do great as the would-be adoptive parents. While Bateman taps into his not so over-the-top side (which he used to his great advantage in scene-stealing roles in Smokin' Aces and The Ex), and gives a great character performance, Garner does even better as the over-domineering wife. She gives the role a slightly creepy tinge in a few cases, but for the most part, delivers one of her best performances. While not as commanding as he was in Superbad, Michael Cera, as the father of Juno's baby, gives his character a glossy sense of naivety as the film begins, but slowly falls into a grander sense of geeky goodness as the film goes on. His shy teenage chemistry with Page is astounding, and helps give the film its greatest moments of heartfelt drama. J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney round out the cast, lending the film some of its deeply funny and dramatic moments as Juno's parents, and relative newcomer Olivia Thirlby does very well as Juno's best friend.But for how great the cast was, what I was really anticipating was the screenplay, by current sensation Diablo Cody. I was a little apprehensive at wanting to jump on the bandwagon of praising her, but the script is truly wonderful. While the start of the film feels a little forced with its witty and sarcastic banter, the film gradually progresses into a very fair balance of hilarity and drama. Its gradual depth does not go unnoticed, and as the film packs into its most dramatic scenes, it really becomes apparent that Cody has a great sense of how to write really well. First time screenwriters (or even screen writing hopefuls) can take notes in how well expressed the wording is here (and how obscure pop culture references can still be funny), and just how greatly written the film is. When dialogue comes so natural to some of these characters, it becomes very obvious that the writer knows what they are doing. If she keeps up like this, than I think she could truly be the prodigy that everyone is making her out to be (although Jennifer's Body really does not sound like a step in the right direction).I think what only slows the film down is the near forced relationship between Page and Bateman that grows as the film goes on. I understand its importance to the film and understand why it is here, but I just think they play it a little too loosely and way too longish to make it feel as worthwhile as it needs to be. The two work off of each other well, yes (although not nearly as well as Page and Cera, or even Bateman and Garner), but the dialogue and scenes between them just sound like an afterthought, and do not seem in sync with the rest of the film. They have the humour, they have the references (maybe a few too many), but they just do not jive nearly as solidly as they should. Maybe a little less focus on these scenes, and more with the likes of Cera (who is not underused, but probably could have been used a bit more) or Simmons or Thrilby (who are not used nearly enough) could have helped make the movie even better than it already is.Juno is not perfect, but it is heartwarming and bittersweet all the same. I laughed and almost got choked up by how exquisitely written and how superbly acted the film was. Page is marvellous in the lead role, and Cody just might be on the right path to be true greatness. If only all small Indies could be nearly as memorable or nearly as astonishing as this one is. An obvious candidate for being one of the best (and funniest) films of the year.9/10.",1
"John Malkovich has produced this screenplay by Diablo Cody with Jason Reitman directing (his previous work writing and directing ""Thanking for smoking"" In real life Ellen Page is a rich kid who comes across as a real smart alec and arrogant type and she manages to transfer that character into her previous role in ""Hard Candy"" and this role.This supposedly hip chick foolishly get her self pregnant with a high school jock Paulie Bleeker (played by Michael Cera) and then goes about dealing with the problem.Her very hip and sympathetic parents support her decision to adopt the baby out and the whole thing is of course really divorced from realty.No doubt trailer park trash across the world will celebrate this silly story of teen pregnancy. There is a hint of anti ""pro-choices"" and ""right to lifer"" underlying this film.It ends up a very silly and schmaltzy movie about teen pregnancy that has already sucked in huge box office results as you would expect in these days of really trashy films.",1
"I rarely go the movies, I watch them on cable or rent them usually. When I heard about Juno I was interested but afraid it would disappoint. I Forgot about it and probably would have never seen it if I had not stumbled on it on cable one lazy Sunday afternoon. I think there are some very valid criticisms of the movie and of course there are some errors and questionable choices made, but the movie was filmed in 31 days which I find amazing.One of the reasons I was afraid to see Juno was that I was Juno. Okay a little different but let's just say 17 and a senior in high school instead of 16 and a junior, everything else very similar. The biggest difference-I never met my child's adoptive parents.I stupidly got pregnant though I knew better. Almost right away I realized abortion was not for me and that I was not ready to be a mom. No one ever talked about that 20 something years ago. You either had an abortion and no one knew or you kept the baby. At least that is the way it seemed to me.(not true I know but almost no one talked about adoption) Juno's character is quirky. I don't find her annoying in the least. She is a smart kid and she acts like one. While I can understand why some feel this movie showed teen pregnancy as having no consequences I disagree. The consequences are real for Juno. She has to deal with being pregnant, with finding adoptive parents she likes and trusts. She has to deal with school, her best friend Bleeker's emotions, her own emotions.It is all done subtly and actually very realistically to me. Its a snapshot of what occurred. We don't know every moment of emotion and how Juno dealt with it. We do know at the end she was crying very heartfelt tears and that she felt she picked the best situation for her baby.Its a gamble, there are no guarantees and she deals with that fact the best she can. I find her innocent relationship with Mark Loring very believable and the shaky marriage of Mark and Vanessa as real as it gets.Yes Juno's parents seem to be over the top understanding. However you can tell they are simply accepting, loving people and are there for their daughter, why is that such a stretch for people to believe? I think this was well written, well acted, well cast and very real. The message is not that teen pregnancy and adoption is easy. To me this is one girl's story. It wasn't easy but she made the best of it and carried on with her life and gave her child a good start. As for a 16 year old knowing the references and music that Juno did, well in this day and age every one has access to old music, old TV shows, movies, etc. So its very plausible that Juno is a fan of the 1977 era and has been exposed to it via internet, cable and recordings.It has flaws, and missteps but certainly in the end a great film and one I will watch again and again. As someone who has been through this I cried my eyes out and they were happy tears, to see that some one else saw it the way I did when I was where Juno was.",1
"Those who love Oprah will probably love this movie along with aficionados of daytime soap operas. The strategy of such movies is to give the characters a few quirks but make sure they all have hearts of gold. Juno is full of witty quips (improbable for most 16 year olds) and her boyfriend Bleeker loves tic-tacs (that's about all we found out about him throughout the entire movie). Juno's parents blandly accept her pregnancy and they have nothing much to do except wheel her into the maternity ward when she's about to give birth (funny how the father disappears for most of the movie--he's nothing more than a kind-hearted cheerleader for his daughter when we do get to see him). The screenwriter, Diablo Cody, takes a stab at creating an antagonist in the character of Mark Loring, who decides to divorce his wife and foil Juno's plans of having the couple adopt her baby. But even though he decides to leave, he's also still a good guy--albeit a person who simply needs to ""find himself"". Ultimately ""Juno"" doesn't have enough conflict to keep one's attention for a full hour and a half. Cody falls back on predictable, saccharine moments to fill the void. Did I forget to mention Jennifer Garner? Her 'Vanessa' is probably the dullest of all the characters in the movie. Many on this board who gave the film a low rating fault it for trivializing teen pregnancy. That might be true but the worse failing is the lack of character development coupled with a predictable and sentimental denouement.",1
"This wasn't worth watching, and I had that feeling after I saw a trailer for it while I was in the cinema waiting for ""Atonement"" (that film should not be mentioned on the same page as this one). I got it out from my Uni library, so at least it didn't cost me money. It's not all bad, Jennifer Garner's performance as the woman desperate for a child is very touching, but the rest of the film is so obnoxious and pretentious that I just want to kick it.For starters, how is Juno a ""whip-smart"" teen as the fawning movie critics had it? OK, she has a hamburger phone and listens to indie music. Wow, so original. She certainly wasn't smart enough to use protection during sex, so how could she possibly be surprised to find herself pregnant? It's not Ellen Page's fault, she is quite good in the role, but the terrible writing. Then again, what can you expect when it's written by a former stripper who re-named herself ""Diablo Cody""?The ""teen-speak"" dialogue that was much talked about on release is just rubbish writing. No-one in the role world speaks or acts like the characters presented here, save the adoptive parents. The whole thing just left a foul taste in my mouth. Juno has the baby, gives it up, and then happily goes back to strumming her guitar like nothing happened? Is that growing up and facing life's problems? In short, no. And that's what the theme of the film wanted to be about, and it miserably failed. I'm not usually so negative in my comments but I just can't believe how adored this film was by the critics, and Miss Cody got an Oscar for writing? Best Original Screenplay? The same Award that Casablanca won in 1942? Huh?",1
"As a movie it's good, it's sympathetic, the performances are good, and SOME of the characters react a BIT differently than the usual Hollywood boilerplate.However, the underlying message is such neo-KKKon propaganda, and is so in line with the present-day-neo-KKKon culture of today (Thou Shalt Not Portray An Abortion In A Movie Unless It Leads To Mental Breakdown of The Woman Having It) that I want to give this a well-deserved *1*. Now that this self-censorship on a somewhat positively portrayed teen pregnancy has stretched it's vile claws to indie productions as well, we must fear that even with Hillary Clinton as president we'd have an abortion ban in less than 3 years. I've seen over 3200 films. Only in ONE a pregnant woman actually went through with the abortion: Holly Hunter in ""Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her (2000)"". And yes, this was of the ""You - think - you - can - have - an - abortion - just - like - that - but - you'll - be - sorry - in - the - end""-type. In ALL other films, they give the baby up for adoption, or keep it in the end (Sex in the City! I mean, WTF!?). This, is HIGHLY unrealistic, since American women do have abortions, like 10s of thousands per year. 100s? (EDIT: Just saw ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" - Phoebe Cates - and in that one teen pregn ancy and abortion are portrayed realistically via JJ Leigh.) There is a Canadian show that dealt realistically with teen pregnancy: Degrassi High, were a 14 year old girl got pregnant by a class mate, and in the end had the courage to tell her mother, so they decided that it was irresponsible to let her have it, so she had an abortion. But ... of course this episode was censored! Ny NBC.0 And of course... the girl had a mental breakdown!A REAL refreshing, daring and new take on teen pregnancy would surely be, telling the sensitive, yet funny and touching story of the struggle of a 14 year old getting pregnant and her hilarious but yet heart-gripping search for an abortion clinic willing to perform a 20 week abortion. This search could take Ulyssesic dimensions, with sardonic comments by said 14 year old on parents, on school, on church, on clinics, on doctors and Jehovah Witnesses ... But yeah, guess which country would be TOO conservative for THAT .... I mean, if you can make light of the psychologically damaging experience of giving your kid away to TOTAL strangers, why not about the less psychologically damaging experience of abortion? I really, really, do think that the bond between mother and child after NINE months AND after giving birth to the kid, is far stronger than after 12 weeks or even 22 weeks (in which period it's not even viable) of pregnancy. So, the heartbreak of giving a real live kid away, must be GREATER than whatever guilt over an abortion.This movie is Just So Wrong. On so many levels.1/10 The Melancholic Alcoholic.",1
"Juno MacGuff is a sarcastic, cynical, tomboyish teen played by Ellen Page in a fantastic, perfectly tuned performance. After sort-of-spontaneous (but not really) sex with her best friend, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera of 'Superbad'), Juno receives an unwanted package--a pregnancy. Woops.Juno decides to give her baby to an affluent couple, Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). All seems well at first, but it will be a bumpy road until birth.I can spend hours gushing about how terrific a movie 'Juno' is, but I'm not really the greatest writer on the planet, so I'll just express the fact that 'Juno' has a strange effect on you. After seeing it, I almost felt as if I would walk out of the theater and see Juno MacGuff just standing there, as if she were a regular living, breathing teenager. That's how good Page is. In fact, every single performance in the film is absolutely tremendous. I liked how Allison Janney's stepmom character isn't turned into a whiny she-demon like most formula stepmoms, instead, she's far more friendlier (if a little unsure of Juno's odd ways) than we would ever expect. And J.K. Simmons finally gets a role where he isn't a total jerk; instead, he's a sensitive father who truly cares for his wacky daughter.The soundtrack is awesome, I'll be buying it as soon as possible. The wait for the DVD will be truly agonizing, but worth it in the end. We can see the chain reactions here when a group of truly ambitious individuals (such as Jason Reitman, Diablo Cody, and Ellen Page) get together and make a movie such as this. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it.I give 'Juno' my highest recommendation possible. Sweeeeet, man. 4/4",1
"I saw this film at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival.Juno MacGuff (played magnificently by TIFF regular Ellen Page), finds herself pregnant, knocked up by her best friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera) on their first attempt at sex. Juno, with the help of her best friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby), takes it upon herself to find some adoptive parents. Courtesy of the local Penny Saver, she soon finds childless couple Mark and Vanessa (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner).With the help of her surprisingly supportive father (J.K. Simmons) and stepmom (Allison Janney), Juno embarks on her pregnancy, which ends up affecting everyone in some unexpected and touching ways.This was a great film, probably the best I've seen so far at the festival. Ellen Page gives a wonderful performance as Juno, convincingly portraying her as a real independent free spirit. Michael Cera was good and funny, although I occasionally had trouble divorcing his character from George-Michael Bluth. J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney did a nice turn as Juno's parents. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman were great as the adoptive parents who, while seemingly the perfect suburban couple on the outside, have their own sets of issues on the inside. Bateman especially gave a great performance as Mark, who is worried about sacrificing his own dreams as he connects with Juno over a shared love of music and the reality of the baby sinks in.This is director Jason Reitman's follow up to his first feature film, Thank You For Smoking, which also debuted at the festival on the exact same date and time in 2005. This is screenwriter Diablo Cody's first feature film, and she put together a refreshing take on the typical teen pregnancy story with some great dialogue for the actors. The audience laughed so hard at some of the lines, they drowned out the ones that followed.",1
"Anybody who gets to see the promos or the DVD covers would have enough clue about what the movie is about.Well I can tell you this,its not only the story which was brilliant - Its the wonderfully written screenplay,great acting by the casts,captivating photography with great locations and of course Ellen Page's incredible acting which has made a mark. There is generally a specific group of audience who could appreciate a certain movie,but when it gets to Juno...anybody above the ""PG13"" audience will definitely love it.The movie is about emotions,friends,innocence,parenthood,commitment and of course the fun in living it up! I enjoyed watching the movie over a Sunday afternoon at home,I just fell in love with it :)",1
"Okay, we've had some experiments by risktakers, and now its clear what this new formula is. This movie is effective because it understands what that formula is, what it has to do and then does it with precision.The formula is to take adolescent vulnerability, define it away from the normal high school stereotypes, and exploit it with coolness depicted lightly. So what you do is discard one of the two primary urges of youth (to belong) and emphasize the other, to be cool (to which others want to belong). Being cool is a token standing for being genuine and true. You are therefore endearing and what weaker teens aspire to be.All of us are essentially teens (or pretending not to be), so this dynamic plays on the attractiveness of the character. Its a simple formula, rendered here by very clear writing devices. Its important that the boyfriend be uncool, with his only distinguishing attribute that he was picked by the girl. This is done by the usual means; he's a skinny dweeb and acknowledged by everyone as such. But he's also a member of the recurring nameless group of runners, a chorus all undistinguished in their appearance and behavior. There are writing tricks as well. When we first meet him, she thinks his running shorts are ""more gold"" than the others. There are three important occurrences where he is conflated with furniture, and the metaphor is made stronger by our heroine thinking about assuming the same role. These are so prominent, that I suspect they were the first things imagined.A key scene has her teetering on the edge of seducing an older man, the husband of the couple designated to receive her baby. What she's done is place herself in the way so that he can seduce her. Its something that we sense as subtle in the movement toward the seduction, when she backs out. He asks why she's there if not for this, and she avers that she ""wanted to be a piece of furniture in his life."" This is careful writing, very tightly braided.Of course we aren't meant to see any of this structure because the idea is to fall in love with this girl as exemplar of a personality attractor, and a catalog of desirable traits. She is given some wonderful lines, and directed to deliver them with precisely the type of natural confidence the role requires. Not the role in the movie, but the role such people play in our lives. It helps that she is slight, lesbian (in real life) and confident.Other writerly devices...The ""adult"" couple who will become adoptive parents turn out to be a sort of mirror: a strong woman (with flaws our teen doesn't have) who clearly has picked her male the same way Juno has. He's literally furniture as well, stays home. Has his own room. He is not whole person, and indeed is one of the followers instead of an leader in this social business of who defines who. He leaves the scene to find himself after we learn that is even attracted to Juno.The whole thing is designed as an abstraction. Well, most of these movies are, but this is all affirmed through the credits when we see not a real film of our character walking (after introducing us to her chair), but a semicartoon. Its a cartoon world, with a semireal Juno walking through it. Those first few minutes of a movie are when we are particularly sensitive to cues about the nature of what we are to see. The visual unreality segues to an encounter with a convenience store clerk that affirms, yes, we are to see a semifantasy here that plays with roles. The music underscores the sketchy cartoon motif by being all overtly handmade.Once in the thing, we are surrounded with the need to define ourselves by others, with a focus on children. Her mother is defined in 20 seconds in terms of her three new babies. Her stepmom (who has a new baby: ""Liberty Bell"") is defined in terms of the pseudobabies she still wants. There's the Jennifer Garner character. Its even in little things, like the Manga comic designed for boys of a kickass pregnant teen. Its significant that except for a teary moment near the end, Juno doesn't need a baby to be cool. And we end lingering with a view of that innocent, natural strength, as she goes back to her chair.Good writing.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",1
"What is it about any movie that shows a hip white woman bringing her baby to term that causes film critics to temporarily lose their minds? ""Knocked Up"" was given a free pass and Juno is inspiring some of the worst film criticism I've ever seen.The truth is that ""Juno"" is a calculatedly juvenile film with an immensely appealing main actress (Ellen Page), fake meta-dialog, and an inability to follow-through on its central theme of abandonment.Juno is constructed so as to allow moviegoers to feel as if they've gone through a significant emotional journey, without doing the work. One way it blunts serious emotions is through the use of hipster patois in the place of real dialog. Rob Harvilla, a music critic with the Village Voice described this best:""Teenagers who talk like thirtysomething screenwriters. ""Cool"" parents who talk like teenage screenwriters. A 16-year-old heroine who actually says things like ""Just looking to secure a hasty abortion!"" and ""Just dealing with things way outside my maturity level!"" and (grits teeth) ""Swear to blog!"". Just appallingly cute cute cute CUTE CUTE."" The cutesy dialog has been universally panned in reviews, but its also serving to throw critics off serious discussion of the film's major shortcomings. A.O. Scott in the New York Times:""...not many are so daring in their treatment of teenage pregnancy, which this film flirts with presenting not just as bearable but attractive. Kids, please! Heed the cautionary whale. But in the meantime, have a good time at ""Juno."" Bring your parents, too."" Scott cannot resist writing in a similar style to the dialog, in fact thinking in this teenage way. ""Heed the cautionary whale. But in the meantime, have a good time at ""Juno."" I don't know anyone personally who has brought a pregnancy to term and given up her baby, but I can imagine it's a lot more painful and less attractive than is portrayed in Juno. No amount of squiggly animated fonts and warbly hypersincere outsider-style singing can make up for that fact, and pretending otherwise is the opposite of daring.At one point in the film, after he adoptive couple has seen their relationship dissolve, the character Juno gives voice to the main point of the movie. She says something like: ""I just want to know that love can last. That two people can love each other and it's not going to go away."" A movie-sequence childbirth follows, then a shot of Juno saying she does not want to see her newborn, followed by a single tear coursing down her face. Cut to a postpartum Juno, happily riding her bike, spitting wisecracks and singing twee duets, with the afraid-of-his-own-shadow Paul Cera.I'm not being a moralist here, I don't want to see the character Juno punished for giving up her baby. But it's an unsatisfying experience to have the main theme of the movie evaporate, and to instead be fed a dose of indy candy rather than a resolution, or at least a coherent point of view. Critics have responded to this shortcoming by either ignoring it - offering, as Scott does, a blithe positive assessment of the films earnestness, or else, as Stephanie Zacharek does in Salon, constructing tortuous ""filmic"" criticism:""Juno"" is partly about the necessity of making choices for ourselves, but it's also about knowing when we need to accept help from others. That idea is never spelled out in so many words; it comes through in the actors' faces. ""Language is the house man lives in,"" Jean-Luc Godard told us, borrowing from Martin Heidegger, in ""Two or Three Things I Know About Her."" There are lots of words in ""Juno."" But in the end, it's really all about language."" OK I'm going to let the royal ""we"" pass. Her evasive argument reminds me of ""cold-readings"" by psychics, who employ verbal tricks to keep their marks engaged: ""you're a shy person, but if it's something you care about you have strong opinions, although you mainly keep them to yourself, but when the chips are down..."" Zacharek's version is: ""it's all about language, but not the talking kind, but instead the kind you find in actor's faces, when they are letting you know they need help, which is really what it's all about, just ask Jean-Luc Godard, when he borrows from Martin Heiddeger."" Anything to keep abandonment at bay.Perhaps it's a zeitgeist thing, there seems to be a generalized post 9/11 anxiety about the future of mankind, for example the spate of recent movies about apocalyptic threats to civilization (cf. ""Cloverfield"", ""I am Legend""). Combine this with role-uncertainty created by modern decisions to delay childbearing (cf. Lori Gottlieb's article ""Marry Him"" in the Atlantic Monthly), and the result may be that a simple squiggly-lined movie about a young woman's lack of anxiety in furthering the human race has an appeal that is irresistible. Just not to me.Swear to blog.",1
"While the teen comedy genre has been littered with the fine works of directors like John Hughes and Paul Weitz, most entries are poorly written and acted affairs that fail to capture the world of teenagers. With Juno, director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody have managed to create a realistic portrayal of teenage life without being dreary or overly artsy. The intent of Juno is to tell the story of a sixteen-year-old girl who deals with a responsibility ""way beyond her maturity level"" and the people around her who care. The filmmakers succeed in not only creating the most realistic teenage comedy ever produced, but also in bringing characters who the audience trusts and knows. Juno is down-to-earth and grounded in reality, never over-the-top and intelligent enough to not rely on cheap gags to gain laughs. The naturalist feel of the actor's performances also gives the film a sense of being there with the characters as they charm the audience with their whimsy. Juno is bold and smart and is always entertaining and comfortable.Juno McGuff (Ellen Page) has found out she is pregnant with the child of her on-again, off-again boyfriend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). After choosing against aborting the infant, she chooses to give it to a young couple, Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). That's a gist of it, but what makes the simple plot so winning is the material provided to the ensemble cast, who works with some of the freshest dialogue ever afforded to a teenage film since Alexander Payne's Election. Diablo Cody does not rely on the quirky to make her screenplay succeed, because the characters feel so real and while the dialogue to some may seem odd, it is able to realistically show the vocabulary that teenagers speak every day to their peers. The subtlety of Jason Reitman's direction adds to the scope of reality by not over-doing it and allowing the characters to speak for themselves. Reitman is intelligent to not let the environment take over and he commands control of the production. Even the clothes worn by Juno and her friends reflect themselves. Juno's baggy trousers and loose clothings represent her independent and free mind as well as the gap between child and adult-hood. Paulie's running uniform signifies his attempts at running free like Juno, while Leah (Olivia Thirlby), Juno's best friend, tends more towards Uggs and other commercial clothes, showing how she attempts to blend in with the crowd rather than be herself. Even Mark Loring starts to evolve into more juvenile clothes as he gets closer to Juno. It is this attention to detail that makes Reitman's direction succeed with ease.The performances from the ensemble all serve as excellent portraits of Diablo Cody's characters, managing to bring the right amount of warmth to each part. Ellen Page is the stand-out, shining in every scene and showing that there is a little bit of Juno in all of us. She has spunk, heart and plenty of humour making her one of the best written and acted young female roles to ever grace the screen. The chemistry with Michael Cera adds even more to the power of the character. Michael Cera is known mostly for playing meek, awkward characters, but in Juno, he goes even beyond his role as George Michael Bluth on the comedic masterwork Arrested Development. Cera plays Paulie with both strength and courage, making him a great companion for Juno and a scene where he confronts her is pure genius on the part of both Cera and Cody. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are equally as good, helping in making their character's conflicts and differences un-forced. As Mark evolved throughout the film, so does Bateman who develops the character in key with Cody's writing.The only aspect of the film where Reitman and Cody depart from reality is actually a smart choice. Nowhere in the film is a character shown talking on a cellular telephone, the opposite of today's world where every single teenager appears to be talking into their hand. The absence of such a device expands on the theme of innocence that Juno displays. In an age where teenagers are trying to grow up too quickly, Juno is given the ultimate test of female adulthood by carrying an un-born child in her pouch. In yielding this responsibility and promising to give it to a loving couple, she grows as a character into realising that she is still a child herself and decides to wait a while before she grows up. The touching and poignant final scene, a guitar duet between Juno and Paulie, shows that she needs to hold onto her youth just a little longer before it disappears like track runners rushing to the finish line. Despite the massive popular success that Juno has deservedly received, it is still a small film with a big message at heart.",1
"Realize this movie was hyped to the wazoo for being wacky and offbeat. Actually, it's just garbage. The dialogue absolutely RUINS this movie. I realize it's a movie and is not necessarily expected to be realistic but it is so far from reality (and not in a good way) that it's just annoying. The character of Juno occasionally resembles a realistic teenager but most of the time is just a caricature of some type of person I have never seen or heard of in real life. The soundtrack blows. The whole movie is some pretentious attempt to be cool and artsy and instead just comes across as really silly.The only person I found redeeming in this movie was Jason Bateman. He's a great actor and brings a little reality to an otherwise ABSURD movie. To be honest I really hate this movie because with the cast it had it could have been sooooo much better.",1
"I struggle to recognise anything in this that connects with a reality I've encountered, other than a contrived script conjured by fantasists to get a few laughs from the very engaging performer Ellen Page. Every young woman's experience is unique to her and her circumstance but, you really are operating on the bounds of reality with the prospective adoptive parents and the way they were recruiting. Found the whole thing ridiculous and quite probably funded, supported and promoted by those who build placards in their spare time.",1
"Not funny! Don't waste your time and money! If you've seen the previews, you've seen the funniest stuff in the movie (and by the time you hit the movie, those aren't even funny anymore though evidently some of the people in our theater thought they still were)! Overall, our theater was pretty quiet!The acting itself was very good -- probably the only reason I could rank it as high as five, and there was one excellent piece of advice offered to Juno by her father (seen in the previews when he said she should find someone who loves her for who she truly is), but beyond that, it wasn't worth the time! Otherwise, the overall plot was not terribly believable, and the humor just wasn't there!Summary: 5 out of 10 for positive acting skill and mild humor but lack of believability and lack of seriousness or stress in a situation which would prove very stressful.",1
"When I saw the trailer for this film, what seems now like seven months ago now, I cringed. It came off as if the screenwriter was screaming ""Aren't I quirky? Yay!"" I was hoping, even praying, after the hugely positive reviews hit the street, that the trailer was just trying to sell it as a quirky indie flick, and that it was really just a heck of a lot better than that trailer, which, by the time it opened in the Twin Cities, whence screenwriter Diablo Cody hails, I had seen about a thousand times. Alas, no. Not only is it as bad as the trailer made it look, the trailer shows bits from just about every sequence in the film. It doesn't give away one of the movie's big twists, but it does give away about 75% of the jokes. What's truly pathetic is that only about one out of five jokes were funny anyway. And I wasn't the only one who thought so. The theater was packed (Twin Cities residents can't help but flock to any movie that even mentions the state of Minnesota, and the audience got excited at mere references to St. Cloud, Stillwater and Mankato), but not once did the audience collectively find anything uproarious. You'd hear some laughs at most of the jokes, but it was never everybody, and it was only ever sporadic. And the film had its fair share of gags that completely bombed, the audience entirely silent. The plot is incredibly shallow, and completely uninsightful about the issue of teenage pregnancy. Apparently, it's only a condition that requires belabored dialogue and a constant barrage of twee-pop songs to make it out okay. To make it worse, a large portion of the audience was made up of teenage girls. Between this and Britney Spears' sister, I predict teen pregnancy to be all the rage in 2008! Seriously, the whole film sometimes comes off as Diablo Cody making an embarrassing scramble to prove her indie cred. The Stooges! Dario Argento! Belle & Sebastian (okay, I love Belle & Sebastian, too, so sue me). For the most part, the characters are two-dimensional and come off as disconnected from any recognizable reality. For an instance, would an ultrasound technician express her satisfaction that a teen will not be raising the baby so audibly? Would the receptionist at Planned Parenthood treat a patient so cavalierly? The only characters who come off as anything close to three-dimensional are Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner. Garner in particular is outstanding among the actors, and, with this script, you can put all of the credit with her talent. Her scene in the mall is a knockout (perfect for an Oscar clip, yes?). Really, the performances in general are pretty good. As soon as I saw Ellen Page in X-Men 3, I knew she would be a star. I hate the fact that I think X-Men 3 is her best movie so far, despite the two others she's had that garnered some critical acclaim (Hard Candy and the film presently being discussed). I do wish they'd given Michael Cera, so funny in Superbad, a little more to do. I'd like to propose that we stop Diablo Cody before she strikes again. This script CANNOT win Best Original Screenplay. If I start the hunger strike now, I should be able to get some media coverage. Oh, who am I fooling",1
"We've all done it. We've had that little moment where we think we're clever. We will jot down a poem, a short story or maybe even direct a super poignant student film and try to amaze everyone with our talents. After blowing smoke up our own butts for a while, most of us come back to earth fairly easily. Sometimes, we'll look back on these moments years later and say, ""Ah. My youth. How foolish I was back then.."" and enjoy a bit of nostalgia. Juno is what happens when that moment festers long enough to make it to the big screen.In the first line of the movie, the titular Juno claims that it all started with a chair. I'm thinking it really started with a very pretentious writer named Brook Busey-Hunt (a woman who refers to herself as ""Diablo Cody"" and wrote a memoir when she was only 24, if you want an idea of just how pretentious she is) saying to herself, ""Tee hee! What a neat idea I've just had! A movie that ends with the same thing it begins with! I'm a genius!"" This is pretty much the feeling I got throughout the film; a movie constantly in awe of itself. A movie THINKING it's clever instead of actually making an honest attempt to BE clever. And, as with many films these days, it's designed to be College Kid Quote Fodder. As such, Juno has received much critical acclaim, and yet another bad example of how to make a movie is made. An example that will be copied and recycled to the point of obscenity. If you need proof, look no further than Juno itself, which feels largely derivative of films such as Napoleon Dynamite.It's hard for me to point out anything good about this flick, as nearly every moment of it is so overflowing with arrogance and self indulgence that the finer details are scarcely visible. There were a few moments here and there that made me sort've laugh. Not an audible ""ha-ha"" laugh. Just that little inner laugh where you blow air through your nose once. Most of the dialog is very gimmicky and focuses on making young hipsters feel cool because they have knowledge of semi-current popular culture and the popular culture of yesteryear. Nearly every line is like something out of an episode of Robot Chicken, Venture Brothers or Family Guy, and the young, ignorant, ""edgy"" 20-somethings who are lauding this film as a masterpiece gorge themselves on that sort of thing. The ""THUNDERCATS ARE GO!"" line alone is going to ensure that Juno will be recorded in the annals of history amongst those who wear ""Vote for Pedro"" t-shirts and grown women who still wear those annoying, multi-colored striped socks with all the toes. And there are lot of you. I see you at the mall hanging out in front of HotTopic all the time. And man, Sweeny Todd and Juno at the same time? You guys must be having a liturgy.See? I just did it right there. I was being a snide little jerk who thinks he's funny. But the difference here is that this is just a review soon to be flamed and forgotten, whereas Juno is currently ranked as the 129th greatest movie of all time at IMDb. That might not sound like a big deal, but bare in mind that this puts it above such films as The Gladiator, Annie Hall, The Deer Hunter, Life of Brian, The Princess Bride.. and, well, I don't even want to continue this list. It's too depressing.The film isn't a total loss. There are some decent performances, at the very least. Most notably, we have Juno's parents, played by J.K. Simmons, who many will remember as Jamison from the Spiderman trilogy, and the West Wing's Allison Janney. Their characters were funny, sincere, and had the only worthwhile lines in the film. The would-be parents of Juno's unborn child, played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman, are also played fairly well (though Garner definitely feels more than a bit out of place). The problem is that as convincing and adorable as these characters are, they're peripheral characters with very little to offer. As a matter of fact, the only character in this film who doesn't feel peripheral is Juno herself, played by Ellen Page. Page's performance is a tough one for me to slam because I can't quite tell if she's just wooden or if she's struggling with the awful, novelty dialog Brook Busey-Hunt wrote for her. The other characters aren't so much characters as they are caricatures, and also feel largely peripheral and derivative, even Juno's key love interest in the film.In the end, Juno is just another film to provide young adults something to quote in front of their friends so they sound funny. But because the young people of this generation are so pertinacious and precious, Juno is adored by them and will probably go down in history as a masterpiece along with similar College Kid Quote Fodder movies like 300, Borat and Napoleon Dynamite. I was recommended this movie by a friend, and I was somewhat excited to see it after seeing all the raving in its wake. I won't say for certain that you should or shouldn't see this film. If you think shows like the Venture Brothers or Family Guy are the zenith of comic genius, you will love this movie, and by all means, go see it. If you're a bit less juvenile and have a taste for real comedy like the works of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks, Juno might leave you pretty confused and $8 bucks poorer to boot. Go see Walk Hard instead, while you still can. You'll at least get a good laugh, which is what comedy aims for, and something Juno fails at miserably.",1
"Michael Clayton is not your typical legal thriller. Oh, it has most of the standard trappings of one: double-crossing, shady back room deals, and a guilty client. But in the case of Michael Clayton, the film focuses most of its attention on the questionable moral quagmire of working for guilty clients, living your life protecting those who you can't help but find reprehensible, wanting to get out, but finding you are good at it and that is where your superiors want you. Michael Clayton isn't a revelatory film, but it is a smart one that deals in the grey world that we all live in, not the black and white one legal films are usually about.The central character is Michael Clayton (George Clooney), a ""fixer"" at a major Manhattan law firm. His job entails him cleaning up other's messes, not litigating in a court room. He hates the work, but the senior partner at the firm, Marty Bach (Sydney Pollack), wants him to stay in the job because he has a talent for it. Things are not rosy for Michael right now: his addict brother has run a business venture that Michael was a partner in into the ground, leaving Michael with thousands of dollars in debt; his relationship with his ex-wife is on the rocks, and into this environment comes a whole new caliber of problem: Michael's friend, and fellow attorney, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), who is a lead attorney for a major case for the firm involving U/North, a huge, multifaceted corporation, has discovered evidence damning to U/North, and has also, seemingly, lost his senses.Arthur begins plotting to publicly expose U/North with this evidence, thereby destroying them, something that U/North's lead corporate attorney, Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton), cannot allow. Michael is called in to help calm Arthur and bring the situation under control, but it becomes quickly obvious that Arthur cannot be reigned in, and Karen begins looking at far more dire methods of containment.When you walk into Michael Clayton, you need to be prepared for a limited amount of action, and a fair amount of talk. It is a film about words and far less exciting events than found in many movies. Michael Clayton is also not the most straightforwardly plotted film. A great deal of information is suggested through inference and requires the full attention of the audience. But Michael Clayton is hardly boring. It delves into the decisions that individuals make when their livelihood depends on living in a moral quagmire. Michael is a man who is concerned about making sure that he can make the payments on a huge debt and dealing with the sometimes annoying and reprehensible people that the law firm provides its services to. Arthur is in a similar situation, but he can no longer live with himself and the protection of clients who are obviously guilty. It is debatable whether Arthur is mentally unhinged, or simply woken up to the reality of his actions and what they mean in the grander scheme of things.Michael Clayton is the directorial debut of Tony Gilroy, a longtime Hollywood screenwriter, who crafts a film that manages to keep you involved like a good thriller without providing many of the requisite elements: chases, shootouts and fisticuffs. Michael Clayton is a thriller that works at a slower pace, but still manages to enthrall with its developments. Critical to the film's success is its performances. George Clooney gives us a Michael who feels many aspects of his world closing around him and tries to keep all the balls in the air. Tom Wilkinson's turn as Arthur is that of a man who has experienced an epiphany, seeing the world like a newborn baby. Finally, Tilda Swinton's Karen Crowder is a woman who is all about appearance (one of her first scenes reveals her practicing a speech so that it will appear perfect) and ensuring that no one rocks the boat of U/North. She has sold her soul to the devil and will do anything to keep the company intact.Michael Clayton is certainly not everyone's cup of tea. It requires a strong attention span and a willingness to not have everything spelled out for you. If you can provide that, then it is a film experience that will provide some rewards.",1
"In the title role of Michael Clayton, George Clooney is described by himself as exactly that. Whenever there's a big mess he's the one they send in to clean it up. The law firm under managing partner Sydney Pollack has a real mess on his hands. One of the firm's top attorneys Tom Wilkinson has gone off the deep end. He's representing a chemical company accused of poisoning people with a new insecticide they've developed. Cleaning up this mess might be just a baby sitting job with Wilkinson who mentored Clayton. But it has the potential to be worse because this company is guilty as sin and will do anything to limit the liability and keep their good name.Michael Clayton was nominated for a flock of Oscars including Best Actor for George Clooney as a much flawed hero. Takes a while for the better angels of Clooney's nature emerge. Tom Wilkinson as the lawyer with both conscience and schizophrenia steals the acting honors though. He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Michael Clayton got a flock of other nominations including Best Picture.The film did take home one bit of Oscar gold. Tilda Swinton as one of the chemical company executives who also has an attack of conscience got a Best Supporting Actress Award. She's quite good herself.The film is an interesting look at big business and the high priced lawyers they must retain to keep them out of trouble. Sad in some cases we have to rely on consciences coming to the fore for any justice at times.Michael Clayton, a well done piece of cinema.",1
"During one scene, high powered corporate lawyer Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) practices answers for a coming interview. How do you achieve a work-life balance? The question, of course, could apply to us all.Ideals versus the reality of paying a mortgage? Trapped in a fast lifestyle. You maybe realise what you are doing is less than perfect. How easily can you get out? (One might also ask, how do serious actors balance worthwhile projects against box-office returns. A question that seems to prompt the fluctuating choices of stars like Swinton and Clooney.)By putting such an impasse at the heart of the movie, Michael Clayton becomes more than an edge-of-your-seat legal drama: it is a powerful psychological study that asks how far we will go to avoid facing unpalatable truths.Michael Clayton (George Clooney) is an in-house 'fixer.' He works for a big New York law firm. He sorts out their dirty work. For instance, a big client is involved in a hit-and-run. Or bad stories in the press that need smoothed out. Clayton is good at his job. But discontented. Divorce, gambling addiction, failed business venture, loads of debt. No easy way out, even if he wanted one.U-North is a large agrichemical company (think Constant Gardener). Their in-house chief counsel is Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton). Karen wants to see off a multi-million dollar class action suit. Clayton's firm is employed to wind it all up nicely for her. But Clayton's colleague, the brilliant Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), has an apparent mental breakdown. He strips off during a deposition. Then tries to sabotage the entire case. Clayton goes in to 'fix' things, yet he is gradually forced to admit how good the firm has maybe become at making wrong seem right.Much in the tradition of Erin Brockovitch or even Syriana, this is a film that tries to attack the respected authorities while still working within the format of mainstream cinema. (More cynically, it uses high production values and scenes that last no longer than the attention span of passive audiences  supposedly the length of a TV commercial break.)Directed by the man who wrote the Bourne trilogy, Michael Clayton racks up an intelligent suspense movie out of a plot nominally too dry for mass-market appeal. It reminds us of a world of imperatives we all succumb to. Maybe we don't always stop to question our job or its ethics too closely? Finish our overtime. Get reports ready for tomorrow. Close the deal. Have some private life. Let's leave philosophy for people with time on their hands. 'Nothing to do with me.'This is a moral-dilemma-movie that could easily have failed and doesn't. Two hours of lawyer-talk could be enough to bore anyone. But the screenplay cleverly contrasts high-intensity scenes and well-developed characters. Arthur's psychotic ranting. Clooney's impenetrable cool. Swinton's prepared polish. These are displayed in the boardroom. Or uncomfortably restrained emotion in family scenes. The high-stakes backroom card game. Or the simple, almost documentary-like portrayal of one of the plaintiffs claiming damages from U-North.Director Tony Gilroy is in no hurry to play all his cards. By the time murder enters the game, we are so engrossed that it seems like a natural progression.Cinematography by Oscar-nominated Robert Elswit is crucial. Right from the start, we are torn by fascinating contrasts. A long panning shot through expensive, empty offices is coupled with a sound-over of manic rambling. Suddenly the camera wanders into a busy room. An annoying reporter over the phone. And the overheard phrase, ""The time is now,"" brings everything together in the present. Shortly afterwards, a horrific scene in which Clayton is almost killed. Then flashback four days to unravel a 'smoking gun' that can overturn the lawsuit on which lives, careers and whole firms rely.At one point, a shadow on the lower right of the screen could almost be an audience member standing up. As it advances, we see it is Clooney. His 'reality-check' moment  one with which we have been subtly led to identify  then saves his life. The subsequent soul-searching and inner turmoil also provide one of Clooney's most rounded and complex performances to date. (Additional casting is spot-on, with Wilkinson and Swinton both excelling themselves.)Clayton's ability to ask himself difficult questions is matched by Crowder's knack for self-deception. It is a frightening depiction of the legal mastery of words when she gives instructions for the most abominable acts with total deniability.Although the overly obvious Blackberry product-placement annoyed me slightly, I found Michael Clayton a satisfying film without any of the usual over-simplified characters. Threads are pulled together a bit too conveniently towards the end, but it succeeds in never seeming contrived. If you have always put off thinking a little too deeply about where your own life is heading, it might even give you a necessary nudge. But as all-round entertainment to a thinking audience, Michael Clayton is one of this summer's better movies.",1
"After seeing ""Superbad"" last weekend, I needed a grown-up antidote and this movie is certainly that. A slow moving, adult, serious movie with a message.The movie has a number of themes including ageing, corruption, principles and truth. The movie's message is that there is more to life than making money.The acting is uniformly good but Clooney is outstanding. His character is complex and he's pretty unhappy with what he has become. But it's all done very subtly. There are no obvious messages in this movie. As another reviewer wrote, you have to pay attention.Don't read too much into my ""slow moving/slow burner"" descriptions. This movie is not boring. It just doesn't whiz along with one implausible twist after another. It's evenly paced with an almost complete lack of silly plot lines (there was no need for the lawyer in crisis to remove his clothes during a trial).Everyone involved in this movie deserves praise for producing a challenging, grown-up, movie-with-a-message in the face of a torrent of mindless nonsense.Highly recommended.",1
"There aren't many movies that I enjoy watching twice or more, this is certainly one of them. This is in the running to be my favorite movie of all time. This movie can be hard to follow, and can seem vulgar at times, but in reality the dialogue has a higher purpose: to illustrate how we can get lost in our personal objectives and lose track of the bigger picture. The majority of characters in this movie don't fall into the ""good guy"", ""bad guy"" category, they are various shades of gray, just like real people. If one puts themselves in the shoes of the characters, their actions are plausible and consistent with reality. If you don't want to have your brain challenged by a time-line that bounces around and a complicated story that requires the viewer to put the pieces together you might want to save this for another night, but don't miss it, it's an incredible piece of writing and filmmaking.",1
"So are spoken as some of the most desperate words- not crazy, there's a difference- in recent movie memory. Michael Clayton is about the character trying to deal with his hand of fate, which is pretty dire: he's 45, working for 17 years for a law-firm where he's a ""fixer"", cleaning up the problems that can't be solved through simple litigations. Now he has a problem with the chief attorney, the ""legend"" Arthur (Tom Wilkinson) who has just gone streaking after one of the witnesses in a parking lot. The whole case could fall apart, but is there more than meets the eye? Murder, wire-taps, cover-ups, bombs, and at the core the placidity of a straight-laced face (Tilda Swinton), are all apart of the not-too-complicated puzzle.It goes without saying that there is a little more than some debt that Gilroy owes to Network, if only in the face-value to be taken from the characters: the weathered professional, the nut who really has ecstatic truth in the Herzog sense, the cold and exacting woman, and the guy working as a top dog behind the scenes. But where Network was as dark as satires get, if there's any laughter to come out of Michael Clayton it's only in the extremely uncomfortable moments of Wilkinson walking in a daze through Times Square or disrobing maniacally on video, or a couple of chuckles at the wrap-up climax. It's a paranoid thriller where, in reality, it's not exactly paranoia in the strictest sense: if it's really happening, then it shouldn't be something to watch out for. But Gilroy continues to build on a sensibility of paranoia, of the darkness creeping up behind the corporate facade, of the sinister presence of those men in cars and vans with total access to whatever and whenever with the target. And you thought the Bourne movies- co-written by Gilory- were tense genre pieces.What makes a film like Michael Clayton end up as memorable as it is, almost essential for those wanting to go to the movies for a serious drama without pretense or extreme melodrama, is the script and the performances. It's indeed such a strong script that it surely covers over the direction- as a directorial debut it feels like the work of a professional with countless years behind the belt, with a few notes of experimentation (the opening rambling voice-over on the looming, still shots of the empty rooms at the office at night, and the final shot as something that breaks away from what could be a bit more predictable and instead kind of haunting). And it's something as literate as this that allows for actors to go for what they can do best: for Wilkinson, Oscar worthy to a T, it's both subtle and over-the-top with Arthur, at one point making a masterful stroke of carrying loaves of bread; Swinton makes the careful act of preparation and looking at a mirror like it's everything to the character; Pollack, solid as usual, not too much to say.Then there's Clooney. Already one of those leading men in Hollywood that has enough clout to probably get Sim City made into a movie if he wanted to, when given a serious and complex enough part to dive into (which has been frequent lately save for the Ocean movies) he's near perfect. I love seeing him on the brink of exploding at Arthur when he first sees him going on and on in the prison cell, or when he levels with his kid about his druggie-bum brother, or just in the way he looks frightened and unsure at some horses in a field. And the aforementioned shot couldn't be done so well by anyone else- you don't want to leave the theater even as the credits roll by, because he might do something, something slight behind the usual super-handsome exterior as he leaves the audience wanting to see more. It's an excellent genre film, but it's probably one of the few near perfect performances of the actor's career (and yes, I include Return of the Killer Tomatoes in that group).",1
"This is a well-made suspense film. It builds slowly, it features the key characters in sometimes agonising close-up, it weaves an intricate plot (a bit too intricate, in hindsight -- I'm still not sure why some events were included), and George Clooney is masterful as the morally conflicted character who does his best to hold his collapsing life together, while slowly realising that his role in life is not quite what he thought it was in any case.There are some things this film is not. It's not an action film ... if you expect that, it will seem very slow. It's not a warm and friendly film that leaves you feeling good about the world -- it was shot in winter, just to emphasise its coldness. It's not a comedy in any way, not even through being over-the-top. It's reality rather than escapism.If you like suspense, unflinching realism, stories of moral conflict, criticisms of corporate America, or George Clooney -- or if you're just in the mood to see that kind of film -- you'll love it. If you're in the mood for a film to wash away the cares of the day (as I was), choose something else.",1
"Michael Clayton is the name of the best lawyer in the powerhouse litigation firm of Kenner, Bach, & Ledeen. So good, he's not allowed to waste himself in court; he's used to clean up the messes the firm's rich and powerful clients cause -- and he's damn good at his job. Problem is, it's destroying him from the inside out. At least...it's doing so until he slams headlong into a problem that forces him to see the decay growing within. That problem comes in the form of a brilliant but guilt-ridden attorney named Arthur Edens, whose spectacular meltdown during a deposition has thrown a HUGE class-action suit against a conglomerate called UNorth into turmoil. Michael is sent to get him back under control...or else, thus setting in motion what is, in my mind, one of the most breathtaking suspense dramas I've seen in years.Starting with a tight, stunning script by Tony Gilroy, this movie has every cylinder firing in perfect sync. The acting is, without exception, exceptional. George Clooney takes a vile human being and inhabits him with such sympathy and understanding, he becomes just another man fighting to keep his life going who IS still capable of decency. (The moment where, after Michael's son has seen a beloved uncle who's an addict come groveling for forgiveness, he stops the car and lets the boy know he's stronger than that uncle is so right and so perfect, I nearly wept.) And Tilda Swinton's litigator, Karen Crowder, is so desperate and unsure, you can almost understand why she makes some of the decisions she does. And Tom Wilkinson blazes across the screen as Arthur Edens, who has finally seen the evil within himself and wants to make it right but who, despite all his legal brilliance, is still naive enough to think he can get away with it.The direction is taut, cinematography and editing cool and precise, and all are at the service of an elegant work that uses the suspense genre to illuminate a filthy world that has been glossed over by money and power. Magnificent in every way.",1
"In a world over-run by corporations and lawyers, the little man rarely wins. It takes a big man to keep that world in order. But sometimes another big man comes along to show who really is the big man. Or is it a woman? That said, no big man would exist without the little man - the outsider.While you can watch this movie and see a good story develop, the story makes an interesting shift. The people become the story once the initial story has laid to bare the reason for the peoples' existence.I enjoyed it for that very reason. The characters were all extremely interesting thanks to great performances by everyone. Clooney, Wilkinson, Pollack and especially Tilda Swinton(White Witch from Narnia) - I am in love with her acting ability. I will be doing some back-tracking to catch up on what I have missed from her. In Narnia, she was deliciously evil and in Clayton, she couldn't be any worse at being evil, but that was her character. It was fun to watch how she made weakness such a strength.Wilkinson is such an all around great actor and makes his character seem lovable although pitiful and downright nasty for reasons I won't bring up here. Wilkinson definitely delivers.Clooney provided the best performance in a long time. I think Clooney has long been an interesting performer but this role is just one of his best - dedicated, sometimes mysterious, loving and charming; even funny and sad.You may look for more in the story line but you may miss the best part if you don't accept that the people are the story once the movie gets rolling.8 of 10",1
"I'm a student of noir. Its an American invention, something like jazz, and has colored film and therefore narrative deeply and permanently.My definition of noir centers on the world between the viewer and the story. In the ordinary instance, the characters (usually one man and his girl) find themselves in a world where the laws of cause and happenstance are artificial. Things don't happen as they normally would in life, rather they are arranged. Things are artificially jiggered to produce a story that works for the storyteller. Odd circumstances. Strange coincidences. Unlikely relationships. Things serialized, compressed and displayed for the convenience of the viewer. The thing that's characteristic of conventional noir is that the thing starts with a real reality. We have a common fellow, nominally a Jimmy Stewart type, who is living a normal life and who gets lifted into a noir fate. What makes this so flexible is that we the viewer become gods, jerking around the character. This allows for all sorts of clever ironies and narrative folding because we implicitly become agents in the story.But if you are a modern screenwriter or filmmaker, your greatest challenge (usually) is what to do about this. Its something that Soderbergh and Clooney worry about. What we have here is pretty basic noir, elaborated in three dimensions.The first is that they chose to make our noir hero a full character. No Philip Marlowe here; this guy is comparatively fleshed out and played by someone who knows how to do so.The second twist has been done before. They add in the world of law. That world has a different ontology in matters of cause and truth, so is a handy one for noir games. For lawyers if something really is true it doesn't matter. Its only true if there is admissible proof that it is so. Cause, the basic thing that is at the root of noir fate, has a similar disconnect between the real and the legal. Normally, this would just be a background element. But here there is something novel. Clayton's son has a fixation on precisely these matters of real and unreal worlds. There's lots of talk about how they blend, and a terrific device of a lawyer who decides to ""change sides."" That means shifting from the evil corporation to the ordinary girl, at the same time shifting from memos to a fantasy book  he literally puts a ""new cover"" on a key document. And he shifts from sanity to madness. A key plot point, by the way is that he never did anything without leaving a memo.This is terrific writing and reason to see the thing by itself. Kid, book, reality.The third twist is that we have two noir characters. The woman here isn't just a moll along for the ride. She's Tilda Swinton for heaven sakes, someone equally caught up in circumstance. She's probably in her position because of past sexual favors and trying hard to ""perform."" She's as manipulated by the story as the Clooney character. Its a bit novel and very well done. She's good to have around.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",1
"I have to say that I didn't expect much of Michael Clayton. But it has grown on me in such a way, reassuring me with it's decided desolate aura, that I owe a review to those in a doubtful measure.Although it starts with some idle comings and goings, the first reaction we have is to alienate with Clayton. He is battered down, morally ambiguous, suffered. If one watches closely his eyes, one can discover within how a feeling of despair takes over. Clooney is a very happy, cheerful guy: you will appreciate his work, how he lets Clayton dominate Clooney.In here, the lawyer of the title must decide which side to take in an important lawsuit after his friend changes sides and endangers himself. Is he helping the good guys? How can he tell, deep Inside? The film carries the moral dilemmas, the strangled fight between choosing the good and the correct. Gilroy commanded a brilliant, harrowing script. But Clooney is the definite star, with his sadness, empathy. His sorrow is deeply moving. The Grey, moisturized environments, carefully veiled with a soft mist. Clooney's interior acting, arising within his foggy emotions. This film is not cheerful, it's somehow depressing. But it's a must see.",1
"I saw ""Michael Clayton"" again today probably for the 20th times. This film has amazed me of the right balance, timing, touch, probability, possibility, and still continues to be a wonderful piece of storytelling at my 20th viewing. The premise is most simple, bordering on a soap opera plot. A gray-area guy wakes up against the corrupt and evil surrounding he used to be all right with. He gets to the bottom of his personal and professional life, and wants to crusade against all the wicked hands that feed him. The central theme here is anguish, which I do not know any worldly and sane person not to have. It is a story of greed, money, betrayal, violence, and self-doubts. A few secrets of this film's success, as far as performances go, I believe, are the followings: 1) the likable nature of George Clooney's character 2) the absolutely non-penetrative nature of the character of Tilda Swinton 3) the wonderful madness of the character of Tom Wilkinson 4) the cold-blooded charm of the character of Sydney Pollack. These four main players are with realism and acting internalization. The director Tony Gilroy must have been a great explainer to get all the characters understand inside-out of what they are, aren't, up to, and not up to, otherwise it would have led to shallower performances. I think it is rare to find a film enable us to understand and take a strange compassion towards the so-called ""bad guys"" (in this case, including one very bad girl). The reason is that everyone operates in fear and instability. No one is God and no one is Satan by design. ""Michael Clayton"" becomes the film's title because the bucks stop here. You can follow his final departure from the Grand Ball Room to the escalator and into a taxi, whose driver is instructed to ""just drive for the $50's worth"", and you can judge if Michael Clayton of the world can continue to be a shock absorber for them all, being Gods or Satans. My opinion is: it is a worthily meditative ending of a worthy film.",1
"Michael Clayton is an extremely slow movie that is well worth seeing. So please resist the urge to turn off the movie...I felt a bit like doing this early on in the story.Michael Clayton (George Clooney) is a fixer...a lawyer whose job it is to make clients' problems disappear. So, it's obvious early on that he is NOT a nice guy...not the sort of person you'd expect to be a hero. Add to that his huge gambling debts and you've got a really screwed up man. When he becomes involved in a case where his law firm is representing a chemical company in a class action lawsuit, however, his malleable morals are challenged. Is there something he won't hide?This is a good movie that was nominated for several Oscars and one one for Tilda Swinton for Best Supporting Actress. Well, while the film is good, I can only assume it was a slow year. Yes...it's good. But a Best Picture nominee? And Swinton's performance, though good, was relatively small for the Best Supporting Actress statuette. Still, it is good....just don't expect it's great...which all the nominations would seem to imply.By the way, one of the little things about the film I loved was the scene where Clayton needed to kick in a door. Unlike most TV shows and movies, it took a LOT of repeated effort to kick the door off the frame...an unusually realistic scene indeed.",1
"This film marks an incredible directorial debut for Tony Gilroy. He was an accomplished screenwriter - and his script for MC is immaculate - but his direction was inspired with confidence and craftsmanship. Immaculate performances across the board - especially from Tilda Swinton and Tom Wilkinson. Masterful storytelling and nearly perfect execution. The look and feel of the world was perfectly calibrated. It's one of the those films that gets even stronger with age. There's so much happening in his film, to re-watch is overcome with revelations. I love this film so much. I really wish they made films this smart and well-crafted more often these days. It's just not the kind of film that movie studios care to make anymore. Sadly.",1
"Michael Clayton is a fixer at a major New York law firm; in the opening scenes we see him receive a phone call asking him to help deal with a client involved in a hit-and-run case. Shortly after meeting the man he is driving along and stops to stretch his legs and admire some horses it is lucky that he did as his car explodes! We then jump back four days. His firm is representing a major agricultural supply company that is being sued in a class action case because one of its products was carcinogenic Arthur Edens, the senior lawyer in charge of the case, had a manic episode while talking to one of the claimants and got undressed! Michael brings Arthur back to New York; Arthur is rambling about the firm being on the wrong side; there is evidence that the company knew their product was dangerous and did nothing to stop it. With a potential multi-billion dollar pay-out being sought the company is prepared to do just about anything so Arthur and Michael are soon in real danger.This is an impressive thriller; the introduction nicely makes us think the film will be about a slightly sleazy lawyer trying to get a wealthy client off a hit and run case before showing him telling the man that he isn't the person for the job; perhaps he isn't so sleazy; then the explosion makes one wonder just what he is caught up in by now I was gripped. The main story of a corporation that puts profit before people may not be the most original but that doesn't matter it provides a good reason to give us a gripping story. The subplot involving money Clayton owed did feel a little superfluous but it could be argued that it made him slightly more open to corruption; something that matters towards the end. Tension is fairly high throughout; once we've seen the explosion we know that there are very dangerous people involved. The cast does a fine job; George Clooney is on great form as the eponymous Michael Clayton and Tilda Swinton is solid as the general counsel of the agricultural company. The rest of the cast are pretty good too. Overall this is a solid thriller for those wanting tension without shootouts and frequent explosions.",1
"So there's this giant corporation that creates some super-pesticide (or something) that gets into the ground water of some rural upper Midwestern farmers, and low and behold, leads to all kinds of hellish cancer (exactly what the in-house scientists warned of) that then--Surprise!-- turns into a three billion dollar class action lawsuit. Six years into the seemingly endless proceedings, the lead attorney defending the evil corporation (Tom Wilkinson, channeling Peter Finch from ""Network"") turns into a raving morally conflicted lunatic. In steps the firm's ""fixer"" (George Clooney, somber and serious), the film's title character, to make sense of things and perform damage control. Meanwhile, the corporation's in-house counsel (Tilda Swinton, perfect as an unethical lawyer in way over her head) scrambles towards a fiscally feasible settlement before the truth is leaked.Despite the convoluted legal mumbo-jumbo, ""Michael Clayton"" is entertaining enough, as much of it results in some well executed scenes of wire-tapping and murder. In his directorial debut, screenwriter Tony Gilroy successfully plays with some stylistic elements. Most of this occurs in the film's editing as time-frames and POV's are occasionally jumbled, and dialogue frequently overlaps onto scene transitions. It keeps the viewers on their heels even when what's going is rather dry and boring. The early scenes with Swinton's character are especially well done, as is the elliptical focus on a car bombing.The performances are all top-notch, with the normally smug Clooney nailing the lead role with just the right amount of nonchalant star power. Unfortunately, the attempts at character development are superficial and stretch credibility. If Clayton is such a legal genius and so good at fixing problems, why does he have gambling issues and get sucked into bad business deals with his clichéd shifty brother? Clayton is also given an obnoxiously precocious son who plays into some of the film's more literary motifs, an ailing father, and a noble cop brother (yes, another brother) who factors too conveniently into the film's conclusion. None of these elements or unnecessary characters explain why Clayton is the way he is, or for that matter, who he really is.""Michael Clayton"" comes to a modestly satisfying conclusion, though the internal conflict of Clayton isn't as compelling as Gilroy so valiantly wants it to be. Thanks to some stylish attempts to invigorate what is traditionally a low energy genre and some excellent performances, the film scores slightly higher than a top-line John Grisham adaptation, but still amounts to nothing extraordinary.",1
"In New York, the divorced attorney Michael Clayton (George Clooney) has been working for many years fixing messy situations for the law firm Kenner, Back and Odeen. He has never been invited to become a partner due to his conflictive personality of poker gambler and alcoholic that left him completely broken. Michael's addicted brother owes a high amount to a dangerous loan shark and Michael is trying to find a means to cover the debts. When the brilliant attorney Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) that has been ahead of the U-North case, a complicated three billion dollars lawsuit, for six years has a nervous breakdown and is arrested naked in a parking area in Milwaukee, Michael tries to help his friend, and is involved in an evil scheme plotted by Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton), the legal counsel of U-North.The low-paced ""Michael Clayton"" is a good but overrated thriller tailored for George Clooney, who is perfect performing his complex and ambiguous character. I believe that the excessive nominations to the Oscar show the lack of good movies in Hollywood. The excellent actress Tilda Swinton has another excellent performance in the role of the villain Karen Crowder. However, I am not sure whether I was not paying much attention, but I found the screenplay confused and in the end something was missing to make ""Michael Clayton"" a great movie. Further, I did not understand the need of a bomb in Michael's car; the killers were very effective and why using a sophisticated electronic apparatus to kill the attorney? My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Conduta de Risco"" (""Conduct of Risk"")",1
"Saw this at a screening at the Toronto Int'l Film Festival.This movie is appropriately titled ""Michael Clayton"" because in it we are introduced to the man in his many life roles; father, ex-husband, brother, son, friend and businessman. Some things he's good at, others not so much.Terry Gilroy's debut directing showed a controlled and restrained hand, allowing the multi-tracked storyline to expand and grow, but always with a pull back to the core. For a fairly busy plot with numerous sub-characters, he did a good job of turning over pieces of the puzzle to bring the audience back full circle to the opening scene.Michael Clayton fixes things, but we see in his own personal life there are a trail of problems he's dealing with. It's when he works alone that he seems to do his best work. Once those close to him come into his decision-making process, he lets emotions rule rather than his head.George Clooney always seems to have a message in his movies, wanting us to be aware of the evil-doers out in the world. His boyish charm and general likability makes you root for him. We can relate to him.Michael Clayton is a flawed individual who has good intentions but often gets beaten by the world and the people around him. Can't we all relate to that too? This was a satisfying suspense flick. Key to enjoying it is to pay attention.",1
"Most screenwriters don't have what it takes to shoot a story with the appropriate rhythm. The problem is they like words, words feel nice on paper and they end up over-burdening the director since words don't necessarily translate well in terms of visual and space narratives.Michael Clayton and Duplicity were two movies with a very interesting premise, a promising cast, and a very unimpressive result. So I guess it has something to do with Tony Gilroy. From the very first scenes I felt something important was ill-executed in Michael Clayton. First there's this very annoying, forced, voice-over which really gets us to a very bad start. It reminded me of the introductory v-o narration in the documentary Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room, except there the rhythm picked up and in the end it was a great thriller of a documentary. Then you have some low-key exposition - something screenwriters are deeply proud of, and they sometimes are trying too hard to be subtle, esp. as screenwriter-directors, taking all their time to be subtle. The poker scene should have been a key feature in the exposition, but it feels like a totally irrelevant scene. You don't feel how much Michael Clayton (George Clooney) was/is addicted to gambling, you only get clues that he used to gamble at some other, nicer, place, that he's done bad business as owner of a bar. Low-key, subtle touches but visually it's dumb, uninteresting, uneventful, which is correlated with the fact it wastes time, not advancing efficiently key plot elements.First-reel contact is really bad, and there are no signs it's just a matter of bad introductory choices. Instead, as in 99% of such ill-conceived movies, it's a matter of initial poor choices that will linger on the rest of the movie. The story of Michael Clayton is mostly one big 4-day flashback with a prologue and an epilogue. The prologue is slow, devoid of ""plot peaks"" that could titillate our interest -- forget about building suspense. Low-skills directors mistake suspense for heavy atmosphere, slow narration, and we get more of the latter in the flashback.Disjointed narrative, no sense of immediacy or urgency, no time or space or psychological pressure, the hero is just bullied around in the story. Think of the difference between a tense atmosphere and a character that just moves around somewhat ill-at-ease for nothing seems right in his life. That is the technical assessment of this movie. Now the conclusion is fast, at last, but nothing was right in making us crave for it. it's just edited in at the end, like an clean and sharp attachment to a long and tedious email.Now you can't blame the technical crew, they did a great job but you really have to think of it when you're watching a boring movie. There's a good cast too for sure, but I was not impressed by George Clooney since his character was so little interesting. Now he was involved in the production and he must have thought this was a deep likable torn-apart character, so he is largely to blame here for the decisions made upfront. At the end of the day the premise was interesting but most conspiracy movies from the 70s are more interesting, faster than this.",1
"The plot in this very hard film to follow or comprehend is just beyond belief.The only redeeming quality here is a genuine terrific performance by Tom Wilkinson in a supporting role as a lawyer with a mental problem.Otherwise, you can totally forget this awful production. Clooney and Sydney Pollack have never been worse in a film. Pollack just repeats his lines as if he is reading them. There is very little emotion on his part. What did the hit and run driver at the beginning of the film have to do with the rest of the story? The story-line is so muddled.We all know that we have to watch out for crooked lawyers but this is beyond belief.Clooney's life in this film is one big mess and the film emulates that. Tilda Swinton comes to life only in the last scene.An extremely boring and most disappointing film.",1
"It's late at night, and everyone working at a major law firm in New York is there to settle some fundamental issues. Only one person is missing: he is somewhere else, handling another problem and then going back home. He stops on the way to look at the landscape and possibly think about what he has achieved. All of a sudden, his car blows up, leaving him alive by miracle.Such a prologue would suggest this is the latest spy movie, right? Wrong. We're talking about a legal drama, a slow-burning thriller that allows George Clooney to show his darker side again after his wounded, Oscar-winning turn in Syriana. The former ER star has always favored socially relevant pictures over blockbusters, using his earnings from crowd-pleasers like Ocean's Eleven or Spy Kids to make sure Good Night, and Good Luck, among others, got made. By his own admission, Ocean's Thirteen, which wasn't bad, was on his schedule just to grant Michael Clayton the financial backing it needed. Was it worth it? Yes.The man the title refers to, the guy Clooney portrays, is the same person whose car explodes. The film subsequently moves back in time, showing the events that led to the attempt on Clayton's life. It all has to do, apparently, with his peculiar job: Michael is a fixer, one who erases and constructs evidence, keeping clients out of jail and earning his boss Marty (Sydney Pollack) a load of cash. This time, he has been asked to take care of a fellow ""garbage man"", Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson): he was supposed to make sure everything went smoothly in an important case involving U/North, a chemical company, but all of a sudden he has taken the opposite side, starting to gather proof against U/North and behave bizarrely (stripping in public, for instance); this situation is a pain in the neck for Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton), the company's legal adviser, and for Marty, neither of whom can afford to let this matter go awry. Enter Clayton, whose task is to talk some sense into Arthur and get things back on track. As the days pass, however, Michael gets increasingly concerned about his future, wondering whether what he has been doing so far is the right thing.The legal world is a messy one, something we already knew thanks to John Grisham (referenced in the casting of Pollack, who directed The Firm). Michael Clayton, however, is not based on one of his works, but is the original creation of first-time director Tony Gilroy, who reportedly got the idea for the movie while doing research for his The Devil's Advocate screenplay. Given the quality of the latter, it's hard not to expect the same from Clayton. Alas, the great writer's lack of experience behind the camera shows in the first half-hour, as he struggles to find the right pace for his story: after the shocking introduction, the film proceeds quite slowly, offering tons of information and dialogue but little time to process the whole thing. Considering Gilroy wrote the breathless Jason Bourne movies, such stiffness is confusing.Once the explanatory bits are out of the way, though, the plot starts to flow more easily, allowing the characters to really interact instead of just sitting down and listening to some monologue about what's happening and why it's bad. Wilkinson, who has the most difficult role to play, delivers a competent performance, although Gilroy's decision not to show his previous deeds makes his ""redemption"" a bit hard to swallow. Pollack, in a part he could do in his sleep (see his similar work in Changing Lanes), discards clichés and goes for a sincere, believable characterization. Outranking them both is Swinton, whose purely British depiction of subtle yet tormented evil finds its match only in Clooney's painful intensity: fearlessly playing Clayton as he is meant to be shown (a cynical, calculating scumbag with a serious gambling addiction), he sets aside his trademark charms and conveys real sadness, doubt and ambiguity. Only in one scene does he let his movie star persona emerge, and that he manages to do so without ruining the picture's tone confirms his status as one of the smartest actors working in Hollywood.Overall, it is thanks to the priceless double act between Clooney and Swinton that Michael Clayton rises above average. Far from perfect, that's for sure (the script could have used a bit more polishing), but still smart and thoughtful.",1
"31 October 2007. The rather two-dimensional script and dialogue for Michael Clayton's character didn't offer George Clooney a lot to work with. The beginning was a hodgepodge of unnecessary confusion only to allow the ""surprise"" explosion in the beginning. The plot was loaded down with a lot of side baggage regarding Clayton's life that detracted from the main storyline. Clayton's backstory and his performance on screen didn't portray anybody that one would suspect a multi-billion dollar corporation would actual retain to do speciality jobs, in fact, it seemed that he was almost out-specialized in the movie most of the time. This movie was no ERIN BROCKOVICH (2000) which was based on a true story and was even more compelling, no PELICAN BRIEF (1993). The cloak and dagger stuff was tame and uninspired compared to ENEMY OF THE STATE (1998) or one of the best THE THREE DAYS OF CONDOR (1975). It is a stretch to tie one's survival to a book. The one irony that may have been deliberate which had some sense of justice was how the former addict relative and Clayton's own compulsive behavior balanced out. Even the movie itself sunk under its own manipulative attempt to be something crime drama, thriller, espionage (black opts), political drama, family drama...something, an award nomination wouldn't be out of the question for the one performance that stood out for Tilda Swinton in one of the best supporting acting jobs of the year.",1
"After my 3rd viewing I still consider this to be an excellent film! 👌 Everything about this movie makes it entertaining & well worth watching! It might seem slow moving to some viewers, but the suspense & mystery are enticing. The plot is not predictable and even after a 2nd watch I was still able to be drawn into the mystery & be wondering about the outcome! The allstar cast is certainly the highlight of this movie!",1
"This is one of the most intelligent thrillers you are ever going to see on film. Michael Clayton is one of my favorite films of all time. The line-up of all-star actors should make this movie a clinic for anyone even thinking about acting as a career. The writing is so precise that even the off-hand dialogue is remarkable. Just listen to the phone conversations and the comments people make to off-screen characters. There is no filler.I can guarantee that you won't find a thriller with such a well-developed protagonist as this movie and the director does it by saying so little. We have the briefest glimpse of Michael's relationship to his family, yet it says a lot about him. The same is true of the bond between he and his boss played by Sydney Pollack who is at least as good of an actor as he was a director, and he was a great director. He is fabulous in this film.Tom Wilkinson really landed on my radar with the role he has here. I'm sure that I'd seen him before but I never paid much attention to actors' names.The story is told in jerky cutbacks. I've now seen the movie so many times that I can't remember how this affected me on the first viewing. Now that I just saw it for the umpteenth time, I think that the storyline is brilliant.There are so many iconic and memorable scenes in Michael Clayton it's almost impossible to list them all without just going from beginning to end and writing them all down. The card game scene is creepy and you just know that this sort of sordid action really happens in NY. The part where Michael goes to the rich a-hole's house about the hit and run is riveting and completely identifies Michael's role in that prestigious law firm.The ultra-creepy corporate snuff squad that is called in to fix the problem was, for me, one of the most compelling aspects of the movie. They are as cold and calculating as pest control workers. This movie makes me believe that this sort of service is available, for a price.The ending is so electrifying and satisfying that it's hard for me to think of another movie that rates this high on endings. Tilda Swindon is fabulous in the role of a corporate hack in way, way over her head.",1
"Everyone who is interested in writing should take note from that movie. The first few minutes are a bit disorienting but the movie carefully sets up it's pieces with every player and their relationships.To give you an example, in general I hate it when movies start with the third act until the obligatory ""two weeks before"" line pops up after five minutes.Here it does have a purpose from a narrative point of view to establish the sense of danger and what is about to come. Not only that, because of this we get a first glimpse of our protagonist. The way he is introduced in this opening feels very natural without any heavy exposition dumps. In fact we get a two way-introduction: by his private situation and through his professional life as well.In general, the dialogue here is very precise, to the point and doesn't have any artifice like an Aaron Sorkin script. It has quite some memorable lines that I could almost compete with Glenngarry Glen Ross.This isn't another movie that glorifies lawyers and throws in a trial here and there to keep the attention with spectacle. No, this is more about what happens between the cracks. How arrangements are being done in the background, before we even get to a trial.Especially for the rich clients who benfit from these kind of deals. We all know, it's a dirty business.Nevertheless there's a focus in the humanity of each character and even the 'villain' played by Tilda Swinton is more realistically portrayed in a pitiful manner, rather than a cold calculating CEO we usual expect from those kind of movies. There's one deeply disturbing scene for me which I won't spoil but the way it was so casually shot was quite something.It even benfits from a second viewing because there's a lot foreshadowing and imagery in the background (especially the book the kid is reading).It's a little bit complex in the beginning and dialogue- heavy in terms of lawyer speech so it's definitely a movie where you have to pay attention, but it's worth it. Anyway, to anyone who likes strong character portrayals paired with conspiracy thriller elements, I can wholeheartedly recommend this movie.",1
"People did not like this movie for a simple reason: too negative. I can understand that this movie is so depressing in so may ways. What it shows that Big Fish eats Litte Fish and none of us want to think about that anymore than most of us experience it in our daily life. It shows the battle between the evangelicals and the corporate business man. Or maybe even the battle between evangelicals of today and the non-religious people or atheists of today. Even worse is that this movie shows that religious people, priests are or can be as bad as a corrupt oil man. Maybe why people did not like this movie is because it might have offended them. Especially Paul Dano playing the priest. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are wrong and too extreme on their opinions. People are able to accept this. What people cannot accept is though that these same extremities and same misguided opinions from both characters are very much true in that they are heavily believed still today. Not all Christains are like Paul Dano's character and not all business man are like Daniel Day Lewis's character but many are like them. That is the world we live in.Now is their any alternative or positive side? The answer is yes and that is H.W. the son of Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis). He epitomizes hope. He shows that despite being deaf and having a father who uses him as a ploy for better business he can still break free of the chains that he is being tied down by. What separates H.W. from the residents and evangelists of Little Boston? The difference is that he and his father are educated and they are not. That is how Daniel Plainview is able to manipulate and cheat them the Sunday family, even Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) the priest and preacher of Little Boston. From what H.W. sees and experiences he sees that much of what is around him is just wrong. He uses his experience that he had gained as a kid to break free of the corruption and chaos that could have taken over him. That is one aspect of the education I'am talking about: our experiences and understanding of what is happening around us. Now to get to the technical aspects of There Will Be Blood. It is just truly spectacular in every way. First off the acting was amazing. Daniel Day Lewis gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Daniel Plaiview or ever since movies began to be made. He freaked me out and probably shocked many people. His thirst for power and money was at such a high level that it made me wonder about what people are really capable of. The deceiving, the greed, the thirst for power and the every man for himself attitude actually looked more real than ever to me. Without Daniel Day Lewis I don't think this movie could have achieved what it has. Paul Dano gave a great performance as Eli Sunday though people tend to disagree. I think he gave a great portrayal of an extremist evangelical priest of how he himself had his own thirst for power and how he was more blasphemous then respectful and gracious to god then how you would expect a priest to be. How could people not be shocked by these two characters, I was myself.Why was the music for this movie not liked. I thought this was among the top five musical scores I have ever heard. The music perfectly gave you the feeling of the corruption and deception setting into the movie. It perfectly intertwined with the rest of the movie as the movie itself was ever growingly becoming more and more chaotic and surreal. Probably too shocking though.Paul Thomas Anderson I believe gave the best directing job of the year. He was able to show the oil fields and its processes, the rise of an oil man, the way everyone can be bought even a priest and the hope that H.W. represented. This movie was never boring and it was as stunning of a directing job as Daniel Day Lewis gave as a performance for his role in this movie. The intensity of this movie was as high as a movie could possibly be and some of the credit for this has to go to the director. The cinematography and the music seemed to intertwine perfectly like the rest of the movie. It gave the sense of the time period and as said before the greed, deception, etc. The cinematography did not just give you a negative feeling but a feeling as if what you are watching is real.You should not like this movie just because of the great technical achievements as you should not for any movie but for what it says and how it says it. I'm not even sure if you should enjoy this movie in general but you should not be blinded by your opinions. I applaud you whoever out there who can somewhat understand this movie and get past the lying and deceiving we do to ourselves. This movie really shows the humanity of human beings. Why is this rated-R?It has so many intense scenes that if you get inside this movie it is truly haunting. Now maybe this movie was too powerful for many people, it was probably even shocking for realists. Maybe though its not that surprising that so many people don't like this movie because the truth hurts. Not the truth about corruption or about people but the truth about ourselves.",1
"This is a compelling family drama charting one man's rise and fall as he ruthless exploits oil in the American west. It has everything you could want from a great Hollywood movie: subtlety, excellent acting, a thoughtful and intelligent script and quite wonderful cinematography.It's a film in which the oil is a supporting character in itself, and the series of unfortunate deaths and accidents that beleaguer our leading man reminded me of Emile Zola's excellent novel, Germinal. Daniel Day-Lewis gives another assured performance here, living and breathing rather than merely acting his role, and watching his growing feud with the slimy preacher is the stuff of great cinema. All in all a wonderful, epic film, old fashioned in the best possible sense.",1
"Industrialism and Capitalism can be a Dirty, Ugly Thing just like Sucking Oil from the Earth. Like a Vampire the Insatiable Oil Tycoons have not a Scintilla of Conscience about Humanity at the Price of Their Grandeur and Survival as Larger than Life Demi-Gods.This is an Ugly Film with a Lead Character that Exudes Ugliness. There is a Human Being with a Soul there in Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) that can be Witnessed on Occasion with His Infant Son and even up to and Including the Pivotal Tragedy of a Rig Accident. After that though, He is Completely Corrupted by Greed and Steroidal Ambition. He is now as Handicapped as His Son. The Film isn't any Fun and it is a Hard and Filthy Story about a Hard and Filthy Industrialist. An Almost Demonic Persona that Thinks He is Owed all He can Get because He gets His Hands Dirty.It is a Mesmerizing, Haunting Movie that is a Reflection of a Time when Simple Folks, like Sheep Herders and Ranchers are Easily Hoodwinked by Smooth Talking Money Men and Equally Silver Tongued Evangelist. It's the Second Birth of the Nation, the Beginning of the Twentieth Century.There are No Heroes Here and no one to Root for, it just Holds up a Soiled Mirror to Our Past as it Shines a Light on Our Present. Like the Blood of Our Veins, Oil is Still the Life of Our Nation. Director Paul Thomas Anderson Hardly Manages to Hide the Fact that this Commodity, in 2007, is Still a Source for much of Today's Suffering. It is not a Pretty Picture and Neither is This.",1
"The world of cinema has seen and marveled a plethora of phenomenal performers, who over the years have entranced billions of viewers globally with their guile, grandeur, subtlety, eloquence and idiosyncrasy, but I dare say that none of their performances can match Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood, for sheer ruthlessness, panache, eloquence and cheek. Being the chameleon that he truly is, Daniel Day-Lewis incredibly musters up all his prodigious talent as an actor to conjure up his misanthropic alter ego, Daniel Plainview, whose perpetually smirked face bolstered by his malice filled eyes makes him one of the strongest and the most fascinating characters ever caricatured on the silver screen. Daniel Day-Lewis is at the top of his game and virtually unstoppable as Daniel Plainview, a portrayal that not only resuscitated him as an actor, but also established him as someone who wouldn't leave a single stone unturned to bring his character to life and perhaps it is this very attribute that has helped him in his endeavor to be the absolute best at what he does. Paul Dano is absolutely brilliant as Eli Sunday and has complimented Daniel Day-Lewis in every sense of the word in spite of the fact that he barely had a week to prepare contrary to Daniel Day-Lewis, who had a whole year to prepare. Eli Sunday is ambitious, enigmatic, placid, pesky and pusillanimous and despite being highly contrasting to Daniel Plainview, ironically has many similarities to him, especially the uncanny demeanor that helped them both to inveigle others. It is the chemistry and the ever growing tension between them that makes the movie haunting and spectacular. There Will Be Blood is a morbid tale of greed, betrayal and obsession adorned by some great performances, visually stunning cinematography and masterful direction. Plainview owns a mine with potential silver deposits and his assiduity finally pays off when he discovers a silver ore. He sells it to acquire a crew to help him with the subsequent diggings in the mine. After the mine runs out of silver, oil is discovered in it and hence begins Plainview's journey of insatiable greed and morbid obsession. In order to acquire more oilfields and to strike out further deals easily, he adopts a young boy and names him as H.W. to help build a facade of a benevolent family man for himself. It almost takes him a decade to establish himself as a minor oilman, but this moderate success further intensifies his avarice. Subsequently, a young man named Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) visits Plainview's camp and offers to sell information about his family's ranch, which he claims to have an ocean of oil underneath it. Plainview and H.W. travel to the Sunday Ranch pretending to be on quail hunting while hiding their ulterior motive of verifying Paul's claim. Being as perspicacious as he was, it didn't take him long to find the vestiges of oil in the cracks formed due to the recent earthquake. He tries to inveigle the Sunday patriarch (who almost cried with rapture on hearing the offer) to sell him the land at a moderate price (which he calls quail price and not oil price), but is stymied by owner's ambitious son, Eli Sunday (also played by Paul Dano), who asks him to pay an additional ten thousand dollars towards the building of the Church of Third Revelation. Plainview reluctantly pays him five thousand dollars as advance and promises to pay the remaining amount once the drilling starts. Plainview assembles his crew at the Sunday Ranch and builds the first derrick. He also buys almost all of the land surrounding the Sunday Ranch so he will have not only those drilling rights but also the right to build a pipeline to the ocean to circumvent the railroads and their shipping costs. Eli wants to bless the derrick before drilling begins but Plainview rebuffs him. Using the money given by Plainview, Eli builds his church projecting himself as a preacher, faith healer and prophet. Soon the church has many followers, most of whom are Plainview's workers. Eli's increasing influence on the people and his display of false divinity starts pestering Plainview, who is further flummoxed by congregation's frequent gatherings (the daily prayers prevented the workers from taking desired rest, thereby decreasing their efficiency). Plainview beseeches Eli to make them less frequent, but Eli dismisses him with disdain. Plainview's ruthless ego is badly jolted by Eli's stubbornness and he brutally assaults him and even threatens to kill him when Eli asks him for the remaining money. Eli returns home all covered with mud after Plainview's assault and takes out his frustration on his myopic father, blaming him for acquiescing to Plainview's naked ambition. H.W. is deafened during an oil rig incident and starts behaving as a brat. Disconcerted by the change in the mannerisms of his son, he sends him away. Eli soon gets his revenge when a fellow named Bandy forces Plainview to get baptized at the Church of the Third Revelation (as a penance for a murder that Plainview committed and of which only Bandy knew). While baptizing him, Eli humiliates him by repeatedly slapping him and calling him a sinner for abandoning his hapless child. This incident further intensifies the hatred in Plainview and sets the tone for a deeply haunting finale when they meet many years later. P.T Anderson once again proves his mettle as a director and manages to pack a punch with this poignant and a deeply disturbing masterpiece. The movie incredibly succeeds on every level and entertains immensely, while still delivering a strong message. It was undoubtedly the best picture of 2007 and one of the best of the decade. In fact, it was very remiss of the academy to keep up with its long earned notoriety and prefer a relatively mediocre 'No Country for Old Man' over this truly haunting masterpiece. P.S. 10/10",1
"It has been a while since I watched a film where the acting and casting is so damn convincing - I have to start this review by saying that.The plot is definitely off the beaten track anf the writing very very much a breath of fresh air.Unfortunately this is a film that can come down to tastes quite a bit when the reviews come round, and although I can't necessarily critique it specifically, there is something about it that I just couldn't get gripped by, and the ending didn't truly satisfy me (though the end scene itself is probably the high point of the movie. Confusing review, I know)This is not a negative review by any means, but 8-10 are reserved for films that truly get you talking, or have a huge emotional impact in my opinionAs a recommendation, this film is a definite yes. I believe that I am on the side of people who this genre doesn't appeal to much at all, but as a piece of film and a showcase of acting, it is utterly utterly great.",1
"I had heard about what a great movie ""There Will Be Blood"" is. A friend of my family said that she didn't really like the movie, but described a certain sound in it.Well, now that I've seen the movie, there are a few things that I can say about it. First, Daniel Day-Lewis does a great job playing the completely maniacal, amoral, self-aggrandizing oil magnate Daniel Plainview. Second, Plainview's speech about how he'll bring all the modern amenities to the small town; that brings to mind the fact that the whole American west now does have all those things...they put all these things in the middle of the desert, prompting everyone to use a lot of water, resulting in water shortages. Third, the subject of petroleum calls to mind present-day international politics. Finally, I would say that Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano each individually are better than the movie as a whole (not to diminish the film).Probably the most intense scene is the final segment: there's what Plainview does to his son and then to Paul Sunday (or is it Eli?). All in all, it not only adds up to a very good movie, but Paul Thomas Anderson (""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"") is showing himself to be a very good director.",1
"There Will be Blood! What a fine film! In fact I would go as far to say it is one of the best of the last decade. Visually, it is stunning, I loved the skillful cinematography and shots and the scenery was amazing. Jonny Greenwood's music is atmospheric and haunting as well, the script is lyrical, hysterical and sometimes even baffling, the story is excellent and thematically rich and the pace is fine, quite slow but deliberately so.There Will be Blood is brilliantly directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and the characters are intriguing. In fact to me the character of Daniel Plainview makes the movie. Magnificently portrayed by Daniel Day Lewis, he is quite complex- while monstrous and cold-hearted, because of his love for his adopted son I wouldn't necessarily call him completely evil either. Paul Dano also does a fine job as Eli Sunday.Overall, a truly fine film and one of the best of the last decade in my view. 10/10 Bethany Cox",1
"A few months ago I saw the trailer to There Will Be Blood, at first I was a little put off, it looked very strange and a typical drawn out drama. But then a little later, I saw a different trailer that was much better and looked more interesting. So now it had all this hype and is now nominated for 7 Oscars, including best picture, finally it came to theaters in my home town and my mom and I just saw it. Now, I'm just going to get a complaint out, I think this movie was still a little drawn out, it kind of took on a Kubrick type of feel with the first twenty minutes that had no dialog. But that was the only thing that threw me off. While I'm not as in love with this movie as much as everyone else is, There Will be Blood is going to be a sure classic down the line. The direction, the acting, the script, the sets, everything about this film was done beautifully and shows the utter greed and madness that can turn men into monsters.Daniel Plainview is an oil man, he's in the business with his son, H.W., and he goes around buying land very cheaply, and makes thousands and thousands of dollars when he strikes oil. But when he comes a town called Little Boston led by the tip of a boy named Paul, he buys the land promising the church that he will donate five thousand dollars to it. Eli, the leader of the church, claims he is a prophet and goes to the extreme to prove so with his followers. When Daniel's team is draining oil, his son is blasted away from an explosion of oil and looses his hearing, Daniel at this point just goes mad and meets a man who claims to be his brother, but he later finds out that this man lied to him. He abandons his son and is loosing all sanity, but when the church comes back to him, he claims he is saved. Years later though, he goes from business man to monster and is going to ""drink Eli's milk shake"", you'll see what I mean when you see the film.There Will Be Blood is a film of utter perfection, the reason why I'm rating it so high is because it is a perfectly made film. There's nothing wrong with it, when I said it's a little drawn out, it's just my opinion. But Daniel Day Lewis pulls in a flawless performance and became Daniel Plainview, especially the end, he pulled in such a chilling side and didn't over do the dialog, which I'm sure any other actor would have done. But one performance I am particularly impressed with is Paul Dano's as Eli/Paul, Eli really got to me and was incredible during his sermons, he held his own up to Lewis. He's come a long way since the silent rebel in Litte Miss Sunshine. There Will Be Blood is a GOOD movie, I mean good in the highest regards, because how many of us can say when a film is just utterly good? Not too often. There Will Be Blood is going to be a good contender this year for the Oscars, but we'll just have to see who'll take the best picture award, because we have some good films that are competing.10/10",1
"This film is about a oil businessman who stops at nothing to gain power and wealth. His morals deteriorate with his increasing wealth.At the moment ""There Will Be Blood"" is the top 23th film on IMDb. People hail Daniel Day Lewis as the best living actor, and this is his best performance. According to the posters in the local cinema, Daniel Day Lewis has got over 50 best actor nominations for this role alone. As a result, I have very high expectations on this film.Daniel Day Lewis is definitely great as Daniel, but I find it rather unfair that Paul Dano does not get any attention. Paul Dano is excellent as a religious leader, and he constantly impressed me with his passionate speeches. The other characters, I am afraid, are not as memorable.As for the plot, it is good in outlining how Daniel's morals decline deeper and deeper. However, I think it does not portray the consequences of his declining morals enough. It would be great to see the moral repercussions of his dirty deeds, and the emotional impact of such acts on others. The current plot only displays how he becomes increasingly corrupted, and I find this less than satisfying.The beginning speechless introduction is far too long, and the ending is far too abrupt and fast. It is disappointing that it does not portray more of Daniel and his son's relationship between his son coming back and his marriage. I would also liked to see more of his son's reaction and emotions after being told the truth. The initial 30 minutes can easily be shortened to make way for interaction between Daniel and his son. Actually the whole film can be shortened, and the pace quickened, without affecting the story.I think ""There Will Be Blood"" is not as legendary as people claim.",1
"In 1898, the lonely mining explorer Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) finds silver nuggets in the shaft and a couple of years later her is in drilling business. When the young man Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) sells the information that there is oil in the lands of his family in Little Boston, California, Daniel travels with his son H. W. and buys the ranches in the area. He finds oil and brings prosperity to the locals and increases his fortune. Along the years, Daniel builds an empire but H. W. loses his audition; he meets a man that tells that he is his step brother; he faces the opposition of the preacher Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) from the Church of Third Revelation. The powerful Daniel destroys his competitors but becomes lonely and insane in the end of the 20's.The overrated ""There Will Be Blood"" is technically perfect, with awesome performance of Daniel Day-Lewis. Unfortunately the rise of the oil man Daniel Plainview is too long, boring and without emotion. This character is not well developed in the beginning, and during the first fifteen minutes there are no dialogs. The other characters come and go without any development. It would be better off watching the fantastic ""Giant"" again instead. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Sangue Negro"" (""Black Blood"")",1
"There Will Be Blood. Chilling, Sublime, perfect.First I must say the Soundtrack is amazingly disturbing and sets the tone of the film from the first scene. Many forget the amount of mood that sound sets. The film held me enraptured from first to last second.The story is perfectly displayed. Ever thing is laid out before the viewer in an intentional pace. The film is for viewers with imagination and foresight who can see through the shams of modern movie plot and into the realm of literature.The acting is simply stunning. Daniel Day Lewis can portray lines with a single expression and does in this film.I'm sure many will not enjoy this movie and all I have to say to them is go watch Transformers 2 again.",1
"It's about expansion, it's about capitalism, and whatever that caused the demise of the Wild West myth. ""There Will be Blood"" looks, smell, feels like a Western but this is an Anti-Western more than anything  There's so much to say about this movie but it left me speechless at the end, Daniel Day-Lewis was hypnotic, giving a performance that reminded me of Orson Welles in ""Citizen Kane"", and Humphrey Bogart in ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" ... He's definitely one of the greatest actors of his generation, especially in this performance that probably best defines the alienating effect of materialism. The 40's had Charles Foster Kane, the 80's had Gordon Gekko and the 2000's have Daniel Planview.Indeed, ""There Will be Blood"" is not your typical 'soul corrupted by money and/or power' drama, as I said, it's all about materialism, ending with a pocket filled by gold and a heart made of the same stone you've been working on all your life, it's trusting anything that has a specific color, a specific smell, working on a land to find a greasy black liquid gushing from its womb, and never, never trusting or giving any credit to ""nothingness"" or ""abstraction"".Daniel Plainview considers these abstractions with the most profound disdain. Nothing is free, nothing comes from nothing, nothing is unsubstantial. If one claims to be your brother, he has to prove it, if one should make a deal with you, he should talk business and not about education ... not because it's personal, not because it has nothing to do with business, BUT because it is NOTHING and nothingness irritates Plainview as if the only thing he could believe on had to be material. The rest is nothing, feelings are nothing, believing is nothing, these so strong and noble words for us, well, Plainview doesn't give a damn about them...And more than anything, above all these abstractions, there is religion, God is Daniel Plainview's archenemy  this is the ultimate masquerade for him, the cancer that gangrenes the progress, an evil that transforms people into sheep, almost like animals, the biggest hypocrisy of all  Plainview, the capitalist, almost shares the same opinion than Marx who thought religion was people's opium. And because Plainview despises this hypocrisy, he tries to exorcise his hatred by using religion to achieve his plans, exploiting it, like he exploited his adopted son. No feelings, no sentiments, everything should serve a palpable purpose. The end justifies the means.And ultimately, he gets rich at the end, he's a respected and feared tycoon, as the purest and most implacable illustration of the American dream. But is he happy? no! because power, prosperity, those are still empty words ... he believes in material, in things, in stuff he drinks like the iconic 'milk-shake' metaphor that still resonates in my mind as one of the most memorable hymns to greed and pragmatism. Plainview is greedy, but not evil, evil is still too abstract a word; because it implies the use of one own conscience while Plainview's conscience was dedicated to one goal: getting bigger, possession, expansion, territoriality.And are we to blame him? Let's not forget the bleak cinematography at the beginning of the film where we could feel, the stink of the oil, the hardness of the rocks and the land as an incontrollable enemy ... let's not forget that Plainview spent half of his life stuck alone into dark holes made of land, stone, metal, oil, and raw matter, so close he could almost feel them, so close it became a part of him ...""There Will Be Blood"" is the quintessential film about materialism and its alienating power, when all that matters is matter!",1
"Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is an ambitious, slimy oil tycoon who begins building up an empire in the southwest using his considerable charm, his adoptive son H.W. (Dillon Freasier/Russell Harvard), and ruthless business acumen. He descends on the town of Little Boston, California, building a huge oil derrick and enriching the town. He clashes with Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), the fanatical young preacher, develops a strained relationship with his son (who is deafened in an accident), and solidifies his empire - but at the same time begins to unravel as a person.""There Will Be Blood"" has received mountains of acclaim, as one of the best films not only of the year, but of the decade - and by some, of all time. It's easy to see why, as the film has a great deal going for it: an interesting-on-paper story, impressive direction and cinematography, and most of all, an amazing performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. But at the heart of TWBB is an emptiness, which not even the greatest performance can assuage, and that is the character of Daniel Plainview.The film begins promisingly, with a brilliant fifteen-minute opening scene devoid of dialogue, as Plainview and his associates dig out their first oil well. The introduction to Plainview as a slippery, manipulative man is well-done, and the first two hours or so are gripping. I sat engrossed, comfortable in knowing that all of the build-up would lead somewhere great. Unfortunately, towards the end, I realized that the opposite was true; the film wasn't leading anywhere, and indeed my enjoyment of it largely ended with a painfully contrived and ridiculous anti-climax.The movie has a number of problems in narrative structure. It doesn't have much in the way of a traditional storyline. This is not inherently a bad thing, but the detached nature of the film makes it hard to care about what goes on. The only fully developed thread is the troubled relationship between Plainview and his son H.W., whom the former views as prop to manipulate his competitors and showcase his success. And even this is dropped like a potato at the end of the film. There is also the digressive nonsense of Plainview's ""brother"" (Kevin J. O'Conner) which adds nothing to the film.Another flaw is the movie's lack of context. Though it is set in the early 1900's - a turbulent time when the US government led by Theodore Roosevelt, William Taft, and Woodrow Wilson were tearing down business monopolies - there is no political or historical context beyond super-titles and a few brief mentions of Standard Oil. As the film was essentially a character study, I wasn't expecting an in-depth examination of politics and history, but a few illusions to the time period beyond ""1911"" flashing on the screen would have helped. The attacks on the hypocrisy of religion and big business are socialist primer material (unsurprising given the source is an Upton Sinclair novel) and bring nothing new to the table.The basic problem of the film is in its lead, Daniel Plainview. Not in Daniel Day-Lewis, mind you, who gives one of the greatest performances in recent memory, but in the character itself. Plainview would be an interesting supporting character or villain, a slimy, manipulative man who thoroughly hates everyone besides himself. But there really isn't any depth to Plainview, and thus the film has a hollow center. He doesn't develop over the course of the story; he remains the same character throughout, a bitter, greedy misanthrope, and after awhile he becomes little more than a caricature of an evil businessman.The main reason to see this film is Daniel Day-Lewis. While I wasn't particularly enamored of his turn as Bill the Butcher, Day-Lewis's amazing turn as Plainview almost overcomes the script's shortcomings. Day-Lewis is a fascinating premise, and the brilliance of his performance conversely accentuates the weakness of his character. If it were in aide of something better, Plainview would be the most memorable character in the last twenty years of cinema. As it stands, it's still a remarkable achievement, and if Day-Lewis doesn't win an Oscar there is no justice.Other than Day-Lewis, the cast is non-descript. Paul Dano has received acclaim for his performance as Eli Sunday, but the role requires little more than elementary ham acting. The film's climax in particular illustrate the weakness of his performance. There are a few names in the supporting cast (Ciaran Hinds, Kevin J. O'Connor), but they remain in the background throughout. Cinematography, music and direction by Paul Thomas Anderson are all fabulous, with memorable set-pieces such as the oil explosion and the aforementioned beginning stand-out, but they do little more than cover up the weakness at the heart of the film.""There Will Be Blood"" looks like it should be a great film, but it is a deeply flawed movie with a weak central character. Nonetheless, it's worth a look, and if nothing else Day-Lewis should make it interesting.6/10",1
"There Will Be Blood (2007) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Ambitious film about an oil man (Daniel Day-Lewis) who will stop at nothing to find the black gold. I must be honest and say I don't know what the whole point of this film was or if it was just trying to show evilness in the world but this 158-minute film kept my interest throughout. I think the film drags somewhat right before the final act but outside of that this is a very good epic that certainly has the look and feel of epics from decades ago. The visual style of the film is the most impressive thing as Anderson's camera takes us on quite a journey and also shows off some amazing locations. Another great thing is how we see how oil was produced back in the day and all the small details on the screen make for a very impressive history lesson. I also loved the first fifteen or twenty minutes of the film, which are done without dialogue. We see Day-Lewis' rise and how he got started within these opening scenes and even though there isn't a line of dialogue spoken we still learn everything we need to know about him. A lot has been said about the performance from Daniel Day-Lewis and while it is a great one I wouldn't call it the best of his career. I think he played this same type of character in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York and I think he was a lot better there but that's certainly not a slam against his performance here because he's great here as well. That snake quality the actor brings to this role is quite memorable and even when he's doing something good or worthwhile, you can still see that evilness in his eyes. The supporting cast were mostly good but they are miles behind Day-Lewis and I think this hurt in several scenes including the ones with the preacher (Paul Dano). Dano is pretty good in the role but the part needed someone a lot stronger who could match wits with Day-Lewis.",1
"Wunderkind Paul Thomas Anderson's new film calls to mind Orson Welles' Citizen Kane in its themes and subject, and, shockingly, it's a good enough film to sit side by side with the one most often dubbed the greatest movie ever. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Daniel Plainview, an oil prospector who will do anything to be a success in the business. Much like Citizen Kane, There Will Be Blood depicts how the lust for money will eventually alienate every human being around you, and eventually make you completely isolated from the world. Unlike Citizen Kane, Daniel Plainview doesn't just grow apart from the world, he also becomes insane. There is a lot of metaphorical subtext lining the film's bottom, especially concerning the relationship between fundamentalist Christianity and big business. It's all very interesting to ponder. I don't know if I think the film is one of the most intellectually stimulating movies I've ever seen. For the record, I don't think Citizen Kane is, either. The message ""money corrupts"", while probably true, isn't especially insightful. What both films have in spades is a director with incredible talent who can envelop their audience in the rapturous experience of pure cinema. The desolate, desert setting sucks you in deeply and never lets you go. Every gravelly word spoken by Day-Lewis is anticipated with both glee and dread. It could have went on for three more hours, and only my bladder would have given notice. My only small grumble is Paul Dano in the final scene. He's good throughout, don't get me wrong, but that final sequence takes place over a decade after the last time we saw Eli Sunday. Daniel Plainview has aged, his son (as a child wonderfully played by the wide-eyed Dillon Freasier) has aged. Why is nothing done to Paul Dano to make him look older? At least give him a mustache! I think there must have been a reason for it, but I can't for the life of me imagine what that would be. Otherwise, an amazing experience.",1
"I think the last significant movie I saw that featured Daniel Day-Lewis in a significant role was ""Gangs of New York."" I was reminded of that movie somewhat. My reaction to ""Gangs"" was that it was dreadfully dull, although it did have a smattering of action here and there and at least I could see by the end that there was a point to the whole thing. Its high rating notwithstanding, I have to pin ""There Will Be Blood"" with the same dreadfully dull tag. The difference between this and ""Gangs"" is that there was precious little action to be found here, long stretches of nothingness (about ten minutes passes by at the start of the movie with no dialogue at all) and in the end I really couldn't see what the point of this was. Some parts of this movie are well done. The portrayal of the Old West was totally believable, the look at early oil drilling was interesting, the performances from Day-Lewis as silver miner turned oilman Daniel Plainview and Paul Dano as the charismatic preacher Eli Sunday were good and the final confrontation between Plainview and his ""son"" (Russell Harvard) was very emotional. Overall, though, to me the story didn't seem to flow all that well. It just completely failed to capture my attention, and trying to keep focused on a movie that is just plain uninteresting for two and a half hours is excruciating. For whatever reason I also found the musical score by Jonny Greenwood to be at times inappropriate in that it often just didn't seem to fit the mood of what I was seeing on the screen. Clearly I'm in the minority on this, but I just didn't find this to be a good movie at all, and I frankly can't go any higher than a 2/10 for it.",1
"As a struggling silver miner, Daniel Plainview scrapes together a living until he stumbles upon a more profitable route for this talents - oil drilling. Starting small with one crew and one pitch, the film follows the growth of Plainview's business as he starts to expand. When he learns of oil-rich land out west in California, he and his young son head out there to capture the land and the rights to drill in the area. It is here that he meets the aspiring preacher Eli Sunday, who is interested in what the oil profits can do for his church. As with many of his recent ventures, this new location is a success although, with every victory and crushed competitor, Plainview's drive and ambition grows and consumes all around him.I had heard so much hype and praise for this film on its release that I decided to wait a while before going to see it; after all then someone is saying that it ""rewrites cinema"" (or words to that effect) then it is hard to come to it as an individual without feeling the pressure to praise it and love it so as to not stand out from the crowd. Recently I watched it and was pleased by how easily I was drawn into it but also how quickly the three hour running time flew past. From the very start the story-telling begins and through simple scenes we come to understand the drive and sacrifice made by Plainview to even have a foot on the ladder. It is to the film's credit that it does not paint him as unworthy of the success he will find this way and the viewer is not able to hate him for his intrepid spirit and hard work. It goes without saying that the film follows the logical extension of his drive to succeed and that the next two-thirds of the film presents a much harsher and unpleasant side to this ambition.It is a subject I have often wondered about because the CEO of where I work is in his sixties but is still working and active, making hundreds of thousands each day with shares movements and deals - what makes him keep going when he could clearly just pack it in, buy an island and sit on it. Well, whatever it is, it is probably the same motivation that got him to the position he is in. I am not in any way aligning the two men, but with There Will Be Blood, this is very much the crux of the film as it is a character piece looking at Plainview in this regard. The way it does it is with patience and intelligence so that it is never a matter of one act that pushes him too far, or one moment that flicks a switch within him but rather that it is simple, logical and totally natural for this character. I do think that the conclusion perhaps could have been better but otherwise it is a faultless piece of work.Visually the film is striking. Not for any one image or moment of style though, but for the endlessly eye-catching framing of shots or positioning of the camera. The canvas of the western is of course present but we are never staring at it and somehow, even as two characters greet each other by a pipe being buried against a wide horizon, we are still focused on the tiny characters. A lot of this has to do with an utterly convincing performance from Daniel Day Lewis - it has been said loads but I cannot help but repeat how good it is. Again, it is not down to one moment that can be used as a clip for the Oscars but rather a complete immersion in the character so that he is able to convince whether as a man starting out or a man who is at the end of his life. No matter how impressive the visuals, you never take your eyes of him. To me he is the whole film and the support cast do struggle by being in his shadow to a certain extent, but mostly they all still work. Dano is probably the secondary most important character in the piece and he does pretty well with it although he doesn't really seem to age across the film, which I found distracting and detracting from his work.Along with the visual structure, the use of music is impressive, never forcing its way over the action and only ever being part of what is happening - it is the Academy's loss that they ""couldn't"" recognise the score because the absence of this film makes them look daft. Indeed, in hindsight, so does the dominance at the awards of No Country For Old Men and it should have been more of an even split because they are both very good and very thoughtful films - although for me There Will Be Blood has it over the Cohen's here. OK it is not as entertaining or as accessible a film as that thriller but it is much more engaging and interesting in what it does. From script through acting, filming, scoring and total delivery, it is a magnificent film.",1
"Words don't describe Paul Thomas Anderson's latest epic film project, and he doesn't let them dominate the story either. A significant chunk of ""There Will Be Blood"" has no dialogue and the ability for it to stay so captivating is only a testament to Anderson's incredible ability to tell stories about people through images that says more than about what's happening.Anderson's weapon in this film is no secret. It isn't often Daniel Day-Lewis's name shows up on a marquee these days, especially when it's not tied to something that is sure to be good. This latest choice of his, however, is better than good and so is he. His character, Daniel Plainview, a self-proclaimed ""oilman,"" is deeply complex and troubled. The way that Day- Lewis plays the lighter parts and seamlessly transitions to the darker parts is chillingly believable. Plainview is not only interesting, but he's embraceable, despicable, amusing and frightening all throughout the film.The only truly supporting cast is his son and a self-proclaimed prophet that he comes into complications with played by Paul Dano (Little Miss Sunshine). Dano's performance is unfortunately shadowed by Day-Lewis and it does feel like he was too young to be cast, but the 23-year-old is highly impressive and will perhaps be a marquee name in the near future.""Blood"" is otherwise the strength of Anderson and his crew. The original score by Jonny Greenwood, who is mostly known for his guitar skills in Hollywood, brings something abstract that simultaneously fits the film's generally quiet demeanor using a variety of percussion sounds and few musical notes. While some films prefer soaring John Williams themes, Greenwood's theme for ""Blood"" is one dissonant chord and a sound effect that can be best described as a more painful version of the THX sound system effect. It's harsh, but so is the film. Anderson makes every moment count whether it's when there's music or where he puts the camera.To best describe the film in terms of people familiar with Anderson's work, it's his first film that truly translates to the interests of all dramatic film-lovers. It is distinctly his film, yet viewers will be able to grasp it much more easily than the abstract and obscure multiple storyline nature of ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia."" For people new to his work, be prepared to feel some discomfort, but if you pay attention to the way the story is told, then you'll find the mastery of ""Blood.""",1
"With all of the hype surrounding Daniel Day-Lewis' performance (he was, in fact, given a Best Actor nod from the San Diego Film Critics Society, for whatever that is worth) in the P.T. Anderson-directed tale of early American oil speculation, ""There Will Be Blood,"" I can only relate my extreme disappointment.This would have made an interesting 90-minute movie, but, unfortunately, it runs over 140-minutes, most of which is smeared with plasma and petroleum to the extent every character is sullied and unrecognizable as a human being.Perhaps Anderson wanted it that way, after all, it's really only Day-Lewis¹ character (the lubricious Daniel Plainview) that even comes close to developing; the others are simply there to keep him company and accept his violent tirades.Yes, times were tough in the early hardscrabble years of the American West, but this guy makes Jonas Cord (""The Carpetbaggers"") look like Mother Theresa.We first meet Plainview in 1898 mining for silver in Arizona. After a nasty fall in which he breaks his ankle, he discovers oil in the shaft. After a few years, he has a crew and a few successful wells.One day, a fellow worker ­ there with his infant son (for some reason) ­is killed and Plainview adopts the boy, H. W. (Dillion Freasier) for no other reason than to have a cute face to show while he cons the public (see ""Paper Moon"").These are some of the movie's best scenes, with Plainview - and H.W. in tow - visiting backwoods bergs and convincing a gullible populace into signing away land rights for a fraction of what they were worth. Plainview, with a sinister soft-spoken demeanor plays psychological games until the rubes are all but ready to GIVE him the oil rights in perpetuity. Several years later, a visitor tells Plainview about a ranch in California that is soaking in oil, so Pop and son head out there, under the pretense of hunting quail. There they meet the Sunday family, addled dad, Abel (David Willis), a few non-descript females and an Evangelist son, Eli (Paul Dano, ""Little Miss Sunshine"").Plainview and Eli do not hit it off at all, and this is the conflict that sets up the second act. It doesn't take much to finagle Abel out of the Sunday Ranch, as well as the surrounding property, but several tragedies cause many in the town ­ especially the young preacher ­ to wonder if they made the right move in letting Plainview into their midst.When H.W. is rendered deaf in an explosion and disastrous fire, we wonder if the whole enterprise is worth it.Up until this point, I was willing to go along with this film as not only a historical drama relating the days of the early oil industry, as well as a chronicle of rural religious fervor, sort of ""Oklahoma Crude"" meets ""The Apostle.""The problem is, the picture does not continue to walk that thin line. We are now subjected to scene after scene of Plainview¹s descent into madness and murder ­ but with little or no motivation for either.For example, he beats Eli severely and mocks his church; meets a man who claims he¹s his brother; abandons H.W. and generally spirals out of control.He's business savvy, however, and plans to build a pipeline to transport his vast oil reserves to the coast (thus eliminating the cost of railroad shipping). To do this, though, he has to build through a local hermit's (Hans Howes, ""Seabiscuit"") land.The only way to accomplish this is to humble himself before Eli and the congregation and be baptized, obviously a fate worse than death to Plainview who seems to have no morals, whatsoever.Now that he¹s joined the church and gotten his pipeline built, does he enjoy even one iota of his success? Absolutely not.In one of Day-Lewis' many monologues, he gives us his motivation for being such a bastard, ""I do not just want to succeed, I do not want anyone else to succeed.""Still, that does not explain his psychotic, murderous frenzy, and the longer the film goes on, the less cohesive it became.I can accept his tirades early on, and even a bit of his unmotivated violence near the middle of the film, but Anderson pushes things to the extreme limit. He's even admitted that he watched ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" before beginning to film ""Blood"" - yet he still did not learn anything about coherent film-making.Friends, this is by far one of the most depressing and oppressive films of the year. In fact, it makes ""No Country For Old Men"" look like ""Mary Poppins."" Then, at the conclusion, after watching more than two-plus hours of this evil, hateful man succeed over and over again, we're treated to another brutal, pointless murder -­ this one coming out of nowhere.Like ""The Last King of Scotland,"" in which Forrest Whittaker won the Best Actor award, this is another performance-driven, but deeply-flawed motion picture.Day-Lewis will certainly be nominated for this, and he may actually win, but that does not mean one will enjoy the experience of watching that performance.",1
"I can say that 'usually' I am pretty on par with what the general public think of a movie although I have been known to stray my own way with certain films but I am still blown away in reading all the reviews for this film which would have someone believe that this is one of the best films of the year...an opinion shared overwhelmingly with the Academy who has bestowed numerous Oscar nominations on this film so let me be the first to say that perhaps my opinion is not right this time. However, it is my opinion and I was blown away by how truly outrageously BORING and misrepresented this movie is. I don't consider myself unintelligent by any means. I think I can certainly enjoy a great intellectual, artistic picture, and I DO love a great historical epic but I had seen the previews for this film and they represent it completely different than what the film is. There Will Be Blood should have been titled by its origin of work which was ""Oil"" because that is the only thing this film is about. I get the title...its rags to riches, pulling himself from the very bottom through turbulence and trials and ends with him losing his mind basically but my god it takes him a long time to get there and everything in the middle is as boring as the sand around him.Daniel Day-Lewis is very good. I take nothing from his performance as Oil man Daniel Plainview who starts from nothing and ultimately creates an empire at no expense including his own sanity in the end. Considering his character arc covers many years and many different situations, he does a terrific job. Its just the fact that there isn't any real plot or point to the three hour film to help support him. He definitely is the focus of the film despite a small supporting cast. The only other stand out performance is that of Paul Dano, a very gifted actor coming from an awesome role in Little Miss Sunshine. His over the top, bursting performance as religious fanatic and 'healer' Eli Sunday is really something. Its comical in this dark and disturbing way. However the previews of this film imply some sort of great battle of wits between Sunday and Plainview which never happens. Instead Eli Sunday is like an annoying little bug which Plainview swats repeatedly. Dillon Freasier also does a decent job as young H.W. Plainview, who is learning the business from his father until an accident takes his hearing. Its a subtle and quiet performance but he does well.So you have these good performances, why did I dislike this movie? It is truly uneventful. I mean watching the Oil fields and the events surrounding drilling and making money is very captivating...for 30 maybe 40 minutes...but NOTHING else happens. Its the same for three hours! And then when all is said and done we have this emotional blow out between father and son after years of being apart and then the end of the film is so downright stupid and ludicrous, it just literally made me shake my head. In some ways it was the perfect ending to a film that was just a waste. I DO believe the film makers purposely mislead the general public to believe that this film is about this bloody battle between and Oil Driller and a preacher when it has nothing at all to do with that. I can't agree with anyone on this and seeing the words ""astounding, gory, disturbing"" in people's reviews make me say ""What the hell were you all watching?"" I literally had to fight to keep my eyes open. But to each their own...that's the beauty of art but for me this Academy Awards is shaping out to be a big disappointment. 4/10",1
"I was looking forward to seeing this when it was released in the cinemas , a story of single minded obsession with some great reviews from Daniel Day Lewis performance . Only problem was when I checked the local listings of the local Odeon cinemas it wasn't being screened . Nor was it being screened at the Edinburgh film house which left me puzzled . I did find out that it screened at the Edinburgh Cameo but had finished its run before I got a chance to see it . I was puzzled that film that received much critical acclaim didn't get a wider release but after seeing it on Sky movies I'm somewhat surprised it got so much acclaim in the first place There's a term invented by the American film critic David Bordwell called "" intensified continuity "" which in its simplest term is "" MTV style directing "" . Scorsese did this with GOODFELLAS and CASINO , Oliver Stone with all of his 90s work and Francis Ford Coppolla with Dracula . Bordwell does make a point that shot length seems to be increasing in the late noughties compared to the 1990s . Interestingly NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN which came out the same year as this had a similar , long , rather slow , old fashioned feel to it . But at least NO COUNTRY was a plot driven thriller where as THERE WILL BE BLOOD is character driven which means it can be painfully tedious at some points The cinematography is good and Lewis certainly isn't bad as Plainview , but the problem is in the cinematic storytelling . The film starts with long sequences with no dialogue and these scenes drags on . There's also a problem with trying to figure out what the message is . You could understand if there's a sympathetic Marxist slant on the fundamental flaws of capitalism but then Plainview's nemesis is shown to be a preacher who isn't exactly portrayed in a good light . Moral ambiguity or moral equivalence ? A thinly disguised attack on George W Bush ? I doubt it , more likely it's just an art-house hit that received more praise than it possibly deserved .There's not much wrong with it per se . As I said it's a film that is shot and framed well with good cinematography and good performances . However for audience members like myself whose main interest in watching cinema is narrative it's a film that I'm in no hurry to rewatch",1
"This film raises the game for everyone out there. I have loved all of Paul Thomas Anderson's work, including his greatly underrated Punch-Drunk Love, but this is a huge leap from any of the previous movies into a realm, as others have said, inhabited by classics such as Treasure of the Sierra Madre - and then some. Every element of this film is astonishing, from the opening twenty minutes, which feature virtually no dialog, to Jonny Greenwood's score, which I have heard criticized as too imposing but which seems just about perfect to me (and brings to mind the non-Blue Danube elements of 2001 at its most experimental). Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is in a league of its own: his voice, his mannerisms, his physical movement, his stunted emotions, are flesh and blood, and hauntingly so, in a way that even Tommy Lee Jones in In The Valley of Elah (which I thought was a pretty staggering performance) can't quite attain. I will watch this film again and again simply to see something so raw and so moving and so gut-wrenching. This is why I love movies; this is what made me want to make movies when I was fourteen years old.",1
"Totally confused, but never fear, I got it.Performances, cinematography, actors, Daniel Day Lewis, blah blah blah - all great.....BUT.............I simply didn't like it.I won't say any more than that.",1
"I'm going to argue against celebrating this movie. It isn't because it is not effective. It is. It is extremely honed so that every horse is hitched to the same plow, so that power is achieved.It isn't because we don't marvel at the actorly gymnastics of Day Lewis. Its because it doesn't matter. I will truly forget this film in the sense that none of it will change me, indirectly lead me somewhere or trick me into some discovery. In preparation for this, I saw ""Siberiade,"" another oildrilling epic where kinship is central and the drive to the earth is a retreat.(The ""blood"" in the title is associated with family, not weeping veins.)Elements of that Soviet film will stick with me forever, though the film has less explosive emotion. (It does have a far more dramatic oilrig fire  real instead of from ILM. And it has teasingly seductive songs, not the edgy, spineraising tension of here.)The one element that should have grabbed me was undeveloped. Here is a man who we see is broken. There are no events to follow. He becomes a success and remains broken. The only story for us to seek is why. We know he had peculiar feelings for his sister and left home traumatically. That he prefers isolation of the most remote kind. That given any opening for bond, for blood: HW, the discovered brother, the child Mary, he will grab it with both hands and look for disappointment.We know going in that the business of twins appeared only late, but it could have been central to this mystery of sucking and discarding both blood and oil. I really thought Anderson would exploit this ambiguity of identity. After all, he's made one and a half of the very best films which explores this. Films that are multilayered and reach out and penetrate instead of a barrelling locomotive.So.I would ask you to differentiate. First differentiate rubbernecking over a disaster from exploring and knowing a dangerous situation. Second, differentiate masterful storytelling from stories that have their own lives and catch fire in your heart.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",1
"I have seen some very bad films, most of them horror or ""movies"" that are spoofs of other films. I thought Meet The Spartans was the worst movie I have ever seen, and even though it is, because it is not a film in a true sense of the word, I have to go ahead and say that There Will Be Blood is perhaps worse than it. Because this is a real film, with a real theme and real actors and a director and so on, TWBB should be in the category of one of the worst films ever made.Reading through some of the glowing reviews here, you'd think this film reinvented the wheel. They praise the acting, the directing, the cinematography. While I'll agree that Daniel Day Lewis was quite good, it does not make up for the rest of this turd. I'm still waiting for something to happen. I know there was something about a bowling alley and milkshakes, but other than that, I'm still waiting for blood. Keep waiting.Literally, I could not wait for this to end. My wife and I were looking at one another in the theater throwing our hands up in amazement every 30 minutes or so (2 1/2 hr. film) when the film's plot still hadn't gone anywhere. There's some stabs at religion, oil tycoons and imposters, but when you keep waiting for the plot to pick up and looking at your watch every few minutes, the film is in trouble.All this film can boast about is Daniel Day Lewis. He is a fantastic actor, but his over acted and misguided interpretation of this maniac is good but not enough to carry the film. This has to be one of the most misleading titles in the history of film. I remember snickers when sitting through the trailer of Blood For Chocolate. What the hell did that mean? But at least There Will Be Blood whets your appetite. I'm here for blood. Where is it? A drop...anything? Sadly, no.I sometimes think the masses are sheep. How else do explain the insane IMDb rating for this film. Powerful? Brilliant? Classic? This sounds like something to describe Titanic or the Godfather, not this charlatan of a film. If you suffer from insomnia, watch this, it is a definite cure.3/10",1
"Danny Boyle has come up with some interesting cinema, certainly defining himself as someone above average. What he achieves in ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is transcend the line between inspiration and a miracle, awakening an emotional connection to the very special element great cinema can deliver. The packages might have changed, and the contents are more controversial and maybe a bit more tied to reality, certainly taking us to an exotic local, teaching us that our world extends beyond our freeway and limited perception of how more than the other half of the world's population has to deal without certainly preaching to us.The tale of two brothers' lives is told to us through episodic flashbacks tied to an episode of India's ""Who Wants to be a millionaire?"". At first, the story introduces one of the brothers as being the subject of a very strong interrogation to find out whether he is being truthful about some knowledge that might be relevant to the game. As he answers the questions, we discover that this young man's life story might be more interesting than we originally expected.There is an element of freshness in the way the story is presented, as we accompany Jamal through his life odyssey from a young child in the slums to a man who is determined to save those he loves. There are some strong emotions in the film, and Boyle's direction keeps the film dynamic and engaging.Prepare yourself to be overtaken by emotions as varied as joy, pity, happiness, anger, revulsion, surprise, and an exhilarating conclusion rarely seen in movies anymore. This film has made me grateful to be alive and that we still have people in cinema like Boyle who understands the power and beauty of the medium. He knows that the perfect mix of a great story and the respective imagery can provoke unforgettable memories in its audience.",1
"Jamal, Salim and Latika, three abnormally cute little kids, live in the Dharavi slums of India. Jamal is a dreamer, proud of his signed photograph of Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan. Salim's a pragmatist. He sells Jamal's picture - the photo epitomizing Jamal's fantasies of upward mobility - for money. Latika sits between them. She's the female trophy who exists to either be corrupted by Salim or saved from the slums by Jamal's undying love.Directed by Danny Boyle, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" tells a familiar ""rags to riches"" tale. Its first act consists of several brief anecdotes, Boyle fetishizing the Dharavi slums, portraying poverty as a carnival of colours and soul-deadening action. Shot with the same over-saturation and hand-held work that made the slums of ""City of God"" and ""The Constant Gardener"" problematic, Boyle treats poverty as a MTV video.Of course it's not all fun and games. Mothers die, eyes are gorged out and child traffickers run rampant, but the film glosses over such matters, using them instead for tactical shocks and easy jolts. The reason these scenes, despite their inherent darkness, seem so trite, is because Boyle tries to have it both ways. ""Millionaire"", regardless of its social probing, is essentially a fantasy. It's a Cinderella story, our heroes rising above the slums by the sheer force of love and destiny, brought together on the set of a television game show, the power of pop culture lifting their dirty bodies from the filth and grime of Dharavi.We're expected to believe that children are harvested and abused, yet we're also expected to believe in magical happy endings where everything works out. Boyle wants the gravitas of a child watching his mother murdered, but he also wants the expired movie clichés central to a Disney love story.Toward the end of the film, a gangster cuts Latika's face with a knife. The resultant scar epitomizes ""Millionaire"". On the surface, we think we're looking at something ""real"", something ""violent"". But look closer and see how carefully placed and artfully directed that scar is. It's a single clean cut, perfectly framing the actress's face. It's not an ugly scar. It doesn't protrude or ruin her symmetry. In no way does it obscure her beauty. So while the initial impression is one of shock or even sympathy, the fraud is that it's carefully designed to be pretty. To be easy on the eyes and head. Contrast this with the Indian kids in 2004's ""Red Light Kids"" or with how the prostitutes are treated in ""Unforgiven"". It's not pretty when a woman is cut up. Boyle's film is one where he's not being honest about the situation, and the responsibility is on the audience not to think twice. Worse still is the film's reliance on destiny. What engenders Boyle's happy ending is the underdog's pure heroism, an egotistical lottery mentality, a belief in destiny, and the prodigal brother's heroic martyrdom. Indeed, Salim exists solely to do the dirty work of killing the bad guys so as not to interfere with the moral purity of Jamal. At the same time, it's hard to believe that anything really matters when everything in the film is simply working according to destiny. Apparently it's destined that all the other slum dwellers (who can't get onto a TV game show) continue to live a life of poverty.The film ends with all of rural India celebrating Jamal's victory as though it were their own triumph. The fact that ""one of their own"" has become rich elicits an outburst of joy. And this is the film's ideology: anybody can rise out of misery, if they are pure of heart and chosen by fate. Jamal is plucked arbitrarily out of the masses as a symbol. He is a celebration of the culture of the dice, the casino, the lucky ticket.And so the film ends with a ""happily ever after"". Our boy and girl embrace before the film erupts into a happy song and dance routine. It's all quite silly. But perhaps Danny Boyle is being ironic, deconstructing the fantasy image and poking fun at Bollywood's avoidance of truth? Or am I watching too much Altman? With this view mind, I gave the film another look. How straight is Boyle playing things? Consider this: the film travels from the ""reality"" of poverty to the artificial world of TV sets, Bollywood shenanigans and big money. The narrative then self-destructs, essentially becoming a thoughtless Bollywood dance movie. Brilliant still, the film ends with the line ""D: It is written"", an allusion to fate, but also implying perhaps that the story is itself fabricated, a screenplay and so profoundly false. Better yet, the entire film is told from the point of view of Jamal, who we know is an imaginative boy and fan of movies. Is it possible that Jamal, like Spacey in ""The Usual Suspects"", has just narrated a cosy lie to us solely to avoid being punished by the police? After all, Jamal is a known con artist and the plot is too unbelievable, too manufactured, to be true. The characters are too cardboard, too stereotype, too comic book. The love story is too insensible and contrived. Is it possible that Jamal has scammed the quiz program and that the film is a scam on the audience? But no, Boyle does not seem to go down this route. There's no irony here, no questioning of artificiality, and little inclination that Boyle believes his picture to be anything more than a straight fantasy. A better filmmaker would have probed deeper, undermining the carefully manufactured Bollywood image, but Boyle seems content with his happily ever after.6/10 – See ""Salaam Bombay!"", ""Los Olividados"", ""Land of Plenty and ""Wendy and Lucy"".",1
"The editing, digital cinematography, and Danny Boyle's direction (with co-director Loveleen Tandan) create a fascinating aesthetic which is perfect for the material. However, barely anyone (among the vast minority of people and critics who didn't care for this massively acclaimed film) is complaining about the film's technical virtues however, so how about all that contrived, sappy melodrama? To my surprise, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is very tasteful in almost every respect. The romance scenes are either beautifully understated (most of the scenes with them as children/young teenagers, and a couple after that) or fantasy melodrama like much of the stuff near the end of the film (although the actual final pre-credit shot itself is again, a tender and beautiful moment). I have no issues with the fantasy melodrama however, because most of the film is done in that tone. Even the very realistic and brutally true-to-life scenes involving the raids of Muslim sections of the slums by Hindus, and the luring of children to a life of begging on the streets (for gangsters and criminals) in exchange for accommodation and food are done in a manner that is both tastefully evocative of reality while fitting in tone with much of the rest of the film, which has a more hopeful tone. It sounds improbable, but that's what the screenwriter and director(s) achieve here. The film doesn't strive for 'gritty realism', but everything in the film (yes, everything) is perfectly evocative of reality. The trouble with 'gritty realism' is that it often is gritty and hopeless in a way life rarely is to most of us, and is actually laughable if done wrong. Jamal's flashbacks to the begging end in misery, but before that we get the happiness and relief of slum life that these children felt. The raid is unrelentingly horrifying, but it is a haunting memory rather than something the film dwells on without stopping. The film also gives us scenes of comedic escapism which are still within the realm of plausibility as well. If you don't know the general plot by now, here it is: Jamal is a boy from the slums of Mumbai who has reached the final question on ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" against all odds. The film, through a plot device I won't reveal even though it's only a mild spoiler, reveals the sources of Jamal's knowledge of the answers to each question (except for the ones he doesn't know and guesses at/uses the lifelines for) through flashbacks to him throughout his childhood and teenage years. Here enter the accusations of the film's supposedly 'hilarious', 'impossible', and 'dumb' contrivances. There's no way a chai wala knows the answers to those questions, and it's too convenient that he happens to have experienced something suitable for all those answers. I beg to differ. With a life like Jamal's (which is, believe it or not, being led right now by many children in India) I should hope that he gained at least that much knowledge. He didn't actually know the answers to every question, and on a game of both luck and knowledge it's entirely plausible to me that Jamal's game could actually happen. The only huge contrivance is the nature of the very last question and what happens when it's asked, but by then the movie had me in its grasp and the ploy worked. The fact that every member of the cast is absolutely excellent, including the child actors, doesn't hurt either. It sounds odd, but ""Slumdog Millionaire"" seemed to me like it found a way to combine a realist look at India (and, according to the Indian person with whom I attended the film, it is absolutely spot-on in almost every regard, and certainly doesn't contradict anything I saw during my short visit to India) and a romantic melodrama. The end result, with the screenplay that combines the drama, comedy, and thriller genres to great effect, is both an aesthetic triumph, and unlikely as it sounds, a crowd-pleasing masterpiece. Also, the music is brilliant, both the original score by the legendary A.R. Rahman and the excellent choices made when it comes to the pop music included in the film (though that is to be expected from a Danny Boyle film). As for those moaning about the love story, perhaps you have not found that person yet, get back to me when you do.",1
"This film came to the UK on a wave of Oscar hype and critical praise and I was looking forward to see it even though the reasons ""why"" it was good seemed a bit vague to me. On one hand it seems to be set in the gritty poverty of India, with descriptions of some very unpleasant scenes but then, on the other hand it was described as being uplifting and the feel-good movie of the year. I was curious how this conflicting information resolves itself within one film without off-balancing it.The overall sweep of the film is very much a rag-to-riches story with love being the real heart of the film even if ""money"" (or a game-show for money) is the narrative driver and essentially it is modern day fairytale. In this regard it is an excellent film because you are engaged throughout, are totally on the side of the main characters and ultimately the viewer would give anything if they could only end the film happily. In this way it is uplifting and (ultimately) a really cheering film that is worth seeing with an audience because it is one of those things that unites an audience with a common feeling of cheer and goodwill. The method of delivery really helps the plot work because it is colourful, frantic and stylish.I really enjoyed the fragmented time structure that uses the re-watching of the Millionaire questions in the police station as a trigger for flashbacks. This means we are gripped by several threads/times rather than it being a straight flow. It is not an amazingly unique device but the manner of it being put together prevents it ever being clumsy or obvious by how it transitions from one time to the other. Speaking of delivery and style, the film is understandably an Oscar contender generally thanks to its upbeat nature (after darker material last year and the current downturn in the world, Oscar probably will look for some feel-good stuff) but the areas I think it stands a great chance are those of cinematography, editing and direction. I say this because visually the film is a treat. It captures the colour of India with great camera work that puts us right in the scene. An example is the early chase through the slum, with a frantic camera, plenty of colour (in terms of palate, places and people) and a great visual style with the sun hitting the camera from above as it moves and other effective devices. With this much movement in the camera throughout the film, the editing is key in making these scenes work and it is excellent throughout  even putting the subtitles in a stylish and arresting fashion which helped sell the use of Hindi but does also match the style of the film more than standard text would have. As director Boyle delivers on all this and his use of music is great as well. It does feel like we have the grit and style of City of God but yet also the warm uplifting story of the very best the ""underdog"" genre can provide.That it achieves this is a testament to how well the film is delivered because it does have to overcome the fact that the majority of the film presents us with a terrible world of poverty and suffering and then gradually pulls the main characters out of it. This is a problem that the delivery covers but ultimately the viewer is left with some fairly harrowing realities that haven't gone away by the end of the film. I totally understand those who love the film unquestioningly but I do agree with those that take pause on this issue and note that it is an aspect of the film that really doesn't stand up in the cold light of day. You see, it is gritty and it is unpleasant and, although not based on a true story, this is a reality in our world and to see so much of it in a film that ultimately leaves you feeling good about life and happy that everything worked out alright is not a mix that sat particularly well with me. It isn't helped by the dance number over the end credits, which involved lots of people and pushed the ""isn't everything great"" idea more than the proper conclusion of the story did. I didn't like this part of the credits for this reason and also it would have been nice to see a film based in India that didn't feel it had to ""do"" Bollywood.The cast mostly play to the ""fairytale"" side of the film more than the grit, although the young children are very impressive in the first sections of the story. Patel took a minute to grow on me but, although not the most charismatic of performers, he is really steady as the underdog who is driven. Kapoor is a great villain, driven by a hate that says a lot about the class system in place. Pinto is stunning and has a much stronger presence than Patel. Khan works the investigation scenes well, which was important as these are where the story is told from. There are no real weak links in the performances  the fairy-tale nature of the tale means everyone has to focus on that side of it but they are still good.The film is not as perfect as you will hear but it is still very good at what it does. It is a wonderfully stylish and slick romantic fairytale that is cheering and uplifting but of course this does give the slight problem that it is a stylish, slick and uplifting film that features horribly real images of cruelty and poverty. It doesn't manage to reconcile this but it is strong enough to make you ignore this for the vast majority of the time, leaving you tense, hopeful and weepy.",1
"Slumdog Millionaire, the best film of 2008 by far, I saw this back in December after hearing a little bit about it on the net. I was so excited to see that it was playing at my local theater and I didn't hesitate to see it when it was released. There are a lot of people who are just asking why this film is so popular or loved, the reason why in my opinion is that it's just a happy film. We usually have a best picture winner that is depressing, but instead Slumdog Millionaire just lifts your spirits and makes you cry in joy. I couldn't believe how much I loved this film, after reading a summary on what it was about, I was just confused and wondering if this film was really going to be good. But we have these unknown young actors: Dev Peitel, Freida Pinto and Madhur Mittal who pull in heart wrenching performances and you can't help but love their characters and just keep rooting for them. All in all, this film is a love story. Most film lovers fear those words after Titanic because everyone thought it to be a predictable puppy love story, this love story however is made in strength and faith and you can't help but keep wanting Jamal and Latika to be together. Even though I saw the film a while back, I still remember it like I saw it yesterday.A title card is presented: ""Jamal Malik is one question away from winning 20 million rupees. How did he do it? A) He cheated, B) He's lucky, C) He's a genius, D) It is written."" Jamal is a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? hosted by Prem Kumar in which he was on the show and won 20,000,000 rupees (about US$500,000). Jamal then explains that, while at least the question about Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan was very simple, he knew the answers of most questions by chance, because of things that happened in his life. This is conveyed in a series of flashbacks documenting the details of his childhood. This includes scenes of him obtaining Bachchan's autograph, the death of his mother during the Hindu anti-Muslim violence, rekindling the memory of the 1993 anti-Muslim attacks in Mumbai by Hindu nationalists in the slums, and how he and his brother Salim befriend Latika. The children are eventually discovered by Maman while they live in the trash heaps. Maman is a gangster who ""collects"" street children so that he can ultimately train them to beg for money. Salim is groomed to become a part of Maman's operation and is asked to bring Jamal to Maman in order to be blinded. Salim protects his brother, and the three children try to escape; but only Salim and Jamal are able to do so. Latika is re-captured by Maman's organization and raised as a culturally talented prostitute whose virginity will fetch a high price. The brothers eke out a living, traveling on top of trains, selling goods, pretending to be tour guides at the Taj Mahal, and picking pockets. Jamal eventually insists that they return to Mumbai since he wishes to locate Latika. When he finds her working as a dancer in a brothel, the brothers attempt to rescue her, but Maman intrudes, and in the resulting conflict Salim draws a gun and kills Maman. Salim then uses the fact that he killed Maman to obtain a job with Javed a rival crime lord. Salim claims Latika as his own and when Jamal protests, Salim threatens to kill him and Latika intervenes, accepting her fate with Salim. Years later, Jamal has a position at a call center. When he is asked to cover for a co-worker for a couple of minutes, he searches the database for Salim and Latika. He gets in touch with Salim, who has become a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed's organization. Jamal confronts a regretful Salim on tense terms. Salim invites Jamal to live with him and after following Salem, he sees Latika living there. He talks his way in as the new chef and tries to convince Latika to leave. She tries to discourage him, but on the first day that Jamal waits at the train station, Latika attempts to escape with him, but is recaptured by Salim and Javed's men. One of the men then slashes her cheek with a knife, scarring her as Salim drives off, leaving Jamal with the onlooking crowd. Jamal again loses contact with Latika when Javed moves to another house. In another attempt to find Latika, Jamal tries out for the popular game show because he knows that she will be watching.I cannot wait for this movie to be released on DVD, it's a terrific uplifting movie that just captures your heart and makes you feel good. I couldn't believe that people were just complaining about the ending dance sequence, it was a TERRIFIC way to end it, to see everything that Jamal went through and that dance just makes you feel happy because you can tell the joy of him having his Latika in his arms. It was a beautiful ending and makes you extremely joyful. The story is brutal, funny, sad, original and beautiful. Danny Boyle, I knew that this director had something special when he made the horror film 28 Days Later, but who knew he could pull of such an uplifting beautifully made film? He picked the perfect actors, made the film wonderfully, and the whole crew seemed to enjoy making this together. Who wouldn't? It was a pleasure to watch on the screen and if you haven't seen this film in the theater, buy it when it comes on DVD, it's one of the most terrific experiences I've had watching a film. We haven't had a film like Slumdog Millionaire and it's one of my new favorite films of all time.10/10",1
"It doesn't seem like a stretch to suggest that America might now be ready to embrace films in the style of India's Bollywood films. While ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is far from a Bollywood tragic love story filled with singing and dancing, the way director Danny Boyle will rivet audiences with his film that is authentic to Indian culture while using a distinctly Western style of film-making might be enough proof that there is a profit to be made here.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a drama exposing the tragic effects of poverty in gigantic Indian cities like Mumbai that is also fused with a modern day Indian fairytale. Jamal Malik is a young man on India's ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire"" and is a question away from one million dollars when he's arrested on suspicion of cheating. Because Jamal is from the slums of India and has no educational background, it seems entirely improbable if not impossible that Jamal could make it this far, but each question is connected with distinct and sometimes painful memories for Jamal. It's as if he is destined to win, even though he only went on the show to impress a girl he has loved his whole life, Latika.Danny Boyle (""28 Days Later,"" ""Sunshine"") takes us from memory to memory as Jamal advances question by question toward the million dollars. These memories offer vivid insight into poverty in India as well as the lives of Jamal, Latika and Jamal's older brother Salim. As children they are left parentless and taught how to swindle tourists, leading to lives of little fulfillment or even corruption. Despite being separated, Jamal and Latika are reunited several times and in fact Jamal's only motivation in life is his love for her.While the young, unknown, Indian actors are absolutely amazing in this film, the biggest kudos go to director Boyle, who creates an astonishing film. For Boyle to go from science fiction and zombie thrillers to taking on a project as daring and unusual as ""Slumdog Millionaire"" proves that he's not only a brave director, but a versatile one. His great success with making this film intense, eye-opening and full of heart all at the same time prove that he's also an incredible one. ""Slumdog"" is just the beginning for Boyle who might be one of the most progressive and talented directors working today.It's hard to be completely blown away by a film whose core message is about destiny and leans on the fact that Jamal is simply fated to do this well in explaining what has unfolded, but like any good film ought to, Boyle makes you a fan of the characters and not care as much about the logistics as you might normally do. The fact that this film starts out so dramatic and real makes it hard to embrace the fairytale it blossoms into, but it's the great visual storytelling along the way that makes it so enjoyable. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com/",1
"I won't see a better, more exhilarating movie this year than Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire."" If Academy voters have any sense, they will nominate this for Best Picture and Best Director and then vote overwhelmingly for it for both awards.Boyle has taken what is essentially a story about a young man on India's version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" and transformed it into a gritty, realistic, powerful and, at times, gut-wrenching fairy tale. It's a Dickensian picture about a world rarely, if ever, seen in mainstream movies, a film that grabs us from the opening frame and doesn't let go until the credits roll at the end.This is why I love movies. Films like ""Slumdog Millionaire"" are rare. They are things of beauty, works of art that make me fall in love with movies all over again. Boyle has done it twice. First with ""Millions"" (2004), which also, coincidentally, was about a young boy and money; and now with ""Slumdog Millionaire."" This is Boyle's masterpiece - a stunningly original piece of film-making.Every once in a while there is a sleeper film, usually an independent movie, that comes along, takes everyone by surprise, then gets terrific word of mouth and becomes a huge success. ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" (2002), ""Little Miss Sunshine"" (2006) - though I did not care much for it - and ""Juno"" (2007) are such films. But, frankly, those films can't hold a candle to ""Slumdog Millionaire.""What might surprise many viewers is that a third of the dialogue is in Hindi. (And Boyle's placement of subtitles on the screen makes such good sense!) Please do not let that dissuade you from seeing this marvelous film. Do not let the R rating prevent you, either. What was the MPAA thinking? Honestly! There are far more offensive, vulgar and violent movies that are rated PG-13. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" should never have received an R rating. (This film should be mandatory viewing for young people, especially those in industrialized nations.) Simon Beaufoy's script was originally entirely in English, but Boyle's decision to have the Indian kids speak in Hindi, instead, is the right call. Having the children speaking in their native tongue makes perfect sense, especially because Boyle and Beaufoy depicts the realism of the kids' lives.That's what incredible about this film. Boyle and Beaufoy do not shy away from showing the squalor of Bombay. These kids live in deplorable conditions amid the grime, sewers and trash dumps of the slums. And, yet, thanks of Boyle true ingenuity, he creates uplifting and even humorous moments in the slums. There is one moment - and I shan't spoil it for anyone, but you will know it when you see it - that very well might be my favorite film moment in the last five years.Boyle doesn't do a thing wrong here. From his choice of actors to the music to his choice of colors, Boyle works his magic.The performances are uniformly good. Irrfan Khan finds the right balance between a tormentor and a quasi-father figure as the police officer. There's young Dev Patel as Jamal, playing with confidence, bringing a wonderful swagger to his role, as well as a sense of fear that we completely understand. Freida Pinto as the love interest is superb. And, of course, there are the three young 'uns. Perfectly cast, they actually make the film work. Their performances as Jamal, Salim and Latika are so utterly convincing that they completely draw us into the picture and make the jobs of the older actors playing them much easier.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is, I suppose, a dramatic comedy at heart. But it is also much more. It is a film about friendship, gratitude, love, betrayal, poverty and hope. It makes you laugh, weep and cheer as you can't help but marvel at Boyle's sheer genius.The film moves along at a breakneck pace, yet none of the cinematic flair - and there is plenty - seems superfluous. Everything Boyle does, including the Bollywood touches, makes sense. There's such a brilliantly kinetic energy to this film that it is impossible not to be enthralled by it.What Boyle has done is truly miraculous. He has turned a film about street life in Bombay into a visceral, genuine crowd-pleaser. And you will walk out of the movie theater feeling inspired and hopeful, knowing you've just seen something very special.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is not to be missed. It is the best movie of the year. And it is, without any doubt, one of the ten best films of the decade.",1
"Danny Boyle has been a favorite of mine since I saw Shallow Grave, since then he's gone on to make three masterpieces(Trainspotting,28 Days Later and Millions), a near perfect film(Sunshine) a guilty pleasure(The Beach) and a total miss(A Life Less Ordinary). Slumdog Millionaire comes out of nowhere and it could very well be his best film and one of the best films of the decade. Visually like Boyles previous work it's stunning, Apocalypse Now and City of God come to mind and there are dutch angles galore. The raw style mixed with the amazing locations make this film one of the most cinematic experiences you'll ever see. The Sound is perfect, I haven't heard audio like this in a while. This film needs a Sound Oscar nomination, it sounds that good. I went into seeing this knowing very little about it and the person I took with me didn't know anything about it, so I'll just say it's about a young man that goes on Indias Who Wants to be a Millionaire, it's a very unconventional film where they tell the story of his life in flashbacks while he plays the game. It's funny, sad, thrilling, basically a very enjoyable film that deserves numerous Oscar nominations. Also the lead actress is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen, if she isn't a huge star after this I'd be extremely surprised. If the academy doesn't honor this film with numerous nominations it will be a shame but this film will be studied in 20 years and whoever sees this will love it, so even if it doesn't get a single nomination it won't matter. Don't miss this film, it's perfect!",1
"This is a somewhat predictable but lovely film which combines an honest look at poverty in India with one of the best love stories in recent years.Jamal who wants to find his long lost love Latika, goes on a game show called ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"". After he's suspected of cheating, he's interrogated and he starts to explain how he knew all the answers.To say that this is expertly shot would be an understatement. It would be nearly impossible for another movie to win ""Best Picture"" over it. Every shot is amazing and not a single one seems worse than the last.The clever structure of the film uses the backstory to explain how he knew each of the answers to show what life is like for much of India's population. Even some of the more disturbing things that go on are detailed very well in the movie.The actors all did a great job. Especially the younger cast which is rather surprising considering that this is their first time acting for many of them. They acted well and I was sold in the first 20 minutes.Unfortunately, the film's strength falters near the end. Blaming plot contrivances on ""fate"" seemed lazy and the happy ending felt a bit hollow to me. But besides this, this is still a powerful and moving film which will entertain you all throughout it.This is a great movie. It has great acting and it was expertly shot. The movie details violence well and it's handled greatly too. This is Danny Boyle's best movie since Sunshine and Trainspotting.",1
"If you were expecting this reviewer to simply say this is a great Indian film, you have come to the wrong review.Whether acknowledged as such or not, one of the greatest films of all time: * perfect script. At the same time a drama, a coming of age story, a story of personal triumph, and oh-wow a love story for the ages * perfect casting and acting. Launched Patel (later seen on House, among others) * direction to die for. After you see it, the strong emotional scenes (the beggar king who removes eyeballs to increase profits) will haunt you. Not to mention the outhouse scene. And the cell phone scene at the end.* the lesser arcs fight for prominence. Even the whispered asides from the TV host have layers of meaning. The cop who goes from torture to philosophy and back again.* restraint beyond belief. (Saved the dance scene for the credits. Imagine how hard that was!) Have seen it several times. It is timeless. It is wonderful.",1
"Slumdog Millionaire is the kind of film that many people will probably rabidly adore, because it's energetic, invigorating and, at first glance at least, feels like something we haven't seen before. But a whole other group of movie goers may find themselves resistant to its questionable charms, as I did. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a fake. An accomplished fake, to be sure, but a fake nonetheless.The film tells the story of Jamal, who grows up in the slums of Mumbai, India, only to find himself in the hot seat on the popular Indian television version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."" Each question he's asked during the game show triggers a flashback sequence that fills in a little bit more of his story -- we see him become estranged from his brother, who gives himself over to the life of a gangster, and we see him stay true through all of his adversity to his one love, a girl named Latika.It's fairly clear that director Danny Boyle intends this film to be a fairy tale, with the love story providing the film its heart. But much of the film is nasty and unpleasant, reveling in every distasteful detail about Jamal's childhood. Within the first 20 minutes of the film, we've seen Jamal tortured with electricity, Jamal jumping into a vile pit of human excrement in order to get an autograph from his favorite Bollywood star (this scene is played for laughs, because isn't someone covered in sh*t always good for a laugh?) and we see his mother bludgeoned to death by anti-Muslim extremists right before Jamal's and his brother's eyes. Later, we see small children getting their eyes burned out with hot spoons in order to make them more effective beggars. Everyone in the movie but Jamal and Latika, who remain blank slates as characters, is hateful and repellent. Boyle heaps calamity on top of calamity for so much of the film that its facile, simplistic conclusion wrings impossibly false. You can't have it both ways. You can't have your film be both a gritty, slice-of-life indictment and a frothy romantic soufflé. The end product is like ""City of God"" meets ""Moulin Rouge!"" This isn't the first time I've felt this way about Danny Boyle movies. He frequently strikes me as a director who's not in control of his own films. His brand of film-making mistakes the fast and furious for interesting and compelling, and he gets in the way of his own narratives, distracting us when he should be drawing us in.A lot of people might mistake this for a great film. And who knows? -- maybe it is. After all, greatness is a matter of opinion. But my opinion is that this film falls very short of greatness.Grade: B-",1
"Slumdog Millionaire is one of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2008 but the hype surrounding it is a bit undeserved. Don't get me wrong, this is at the very least a good movie and is quite a terrific movie 2/3 the way through. What the movie does though in the last 1/3 is make the fatal mistake of turning into a Hollywood or maybe in this case a Bollywood movie. It takes away from that genuine and satisfying feeling. The acting all around was very good particularly from Dev Patel and the small kids. There performance are probably the only thing that is overlooked in this film. Without much of these very good performances the movie would not have been at the level it was at.The directing of Danny Boyle was his best yet. The look of the film was amazing and many screen shots of India were breathtaking. The musical score was very fitting to the style of the movie. It was one of the best scores of 2008. Where this film fell apart was at the writing. Towards the end its withdrew into a standard romance. It was no longer the great and amazing adventure we had witnessed for most of the movie. The complex relations seemed to be over simplified and it does the safe thing to do in the approach of tone but if taken into a drastically different direction could have lead it to be a real classic. Yet instead of ever peaking or sky rocketing to greatness it had plateaued and didn't deliver the way I had hoped it would, this largely in part by the failure of the screenplay.Many people have compared this film to City of God because the film are actually similar in many ways. Yet City of God has something Slumdog Millionaire does not have which is depth and character motivations. These things are vital to these kind of movies being successful. City of God seemed to have a more plausible story because the story was more linear. Events took place as a result of other events. This did not happen in Slumdog Millionaire, the story was more chopped up and too many of the events just seemed to pop up out of no where. Slumdog Millionaire did take a very ambitious approach in the way it was made which is commendable. Is this a 1st rate movie though? The answer to that is no.",1
"Bless us all, Danny Boyle is in his prime. His ""Sunshine"" was lifeatleringly effective for me. He does things with a camera that are new, effective. He does better than others in providing a story foundation that fits the cinematic effects. He's visually clever. Its all more than enough for me.Here, he appeases audiences too much for my taste in building a happy ending that has you walking out actually believing that you have seen a happy romance, worthy of Bollywood dance fantasy. This, I suppose is his answer to those who were confused by ""Sunshine""s failure to support a common genre. Alas, a shame.But the cinematic bits are more than enough. Quite apart from the romance, what we have here is a (unique I think) synthesis of the film (here a TeeVee show) within that affects the film without plus a similar device of memory within. Here it is both a recall and a storytelling. The earlier in life we go, the more hectic and jagged the visions. It starts with one of the three ""City of God"" types of choppy editing and slowly bleeds into a normally paced picture. But that ""City of God"" stuff was mostly just in camera motion, and intended to contrast with the other two ""personalities.""Here it is in the camera, in the movement of the actors and deeply in the editing. Its integrated and cinematic. Its brilliant. I think that is because of the way Boyle has digested the results of Dogma 95. There was a lot of pretentious stuff in that manifesto, but its core and ultimately its effect has been the opposite of the intended. The capture of the natural to be true has to involve intrusive craft, not lack of craft. Boyle, without notice has picked up Dogma graduates for his crew, more this time than usual.The beginning of this film is true, powerful, full of life, energy. It is real. As it progresses and our hero enters and is accepted into TeeVee land it becomes more romantic and unreal, more like a Bollywood romance. It is more powerful than any from Bollywood because we assume it to be real from the beginning. Clever.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",1
"An exhilarating realistic fairy tale that will make you feel like flying. I certainly felt it. Rewarding without being opportunistic. This tale of two orphan brothers in a slum of Bombay is a mixture of heart wrenching and uplifting emotions. I didn't know anything about the film other that what I just mentioned and that was part of the enjoyment so I won't talk about the film to allow you the same discovery I went through. Let me just say that this is Danny Boyle's best film and the cast of unknowns is truly extraordinary. The last few minutes of the film will have you on the edge of your seat hoping against hope that what ""is written"" is really written.",1
"I thought the best part of this movie was the photography. Check this film out on Blu-Ray, if you have the opportunity: it's magnificent-looking. They even make slums look beautiful! I'm glad it won the Oscar for cinematography. Scene after scene is gorgeous.Story-wise, it's okay; good, but nothing super. For the first half of the film, it reminded me of ""City Of God,"" about the homeless kids in Brazil, but that film had far more violent kids. This one mainly had kids as pranksters and then victims of some sicko adult who wants to use them to make money.The story will be fun for those who used to be hooked on the ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" quiz show, but the host here in this Indian version is no lovable Regis Philbin. You won't like him.Almost all of the story is told in flashback, so be prepared for that. It's one of those stories where all the little pieces fit together in the end to explain why things happened in the start of the film.I wouldn't have voted for this as the Best Picture Of The Year but it is entertaining and a feast for the eyes.",1
"I had heard some grumbling about this movie being overrated, and until about halfway through the movie, despite enjoying myself, I was willing to give it maybe 9 stars out of 10. But then it became more than the story of a couple of kids from the slums - it became a great retelling of two ancient stories: the kid from humble beginnings who makes history, and the boy who gets the girl, loses the girl, and...well, let's not spoil it, shall we? The second half, as we see the protagonists mature, combined with the climactic finale of the game show, is easily one of the best pieces of film I have ever seen in my life.Yes, Slumdog Millionaire is incredibly unrealistic. Let's be frank, even giving generous leeway for coincidence, there is no way this could have happened. The women featured in the movie are nearly always perfectly pretty; the prominent usage of perfect English is extremely unrealistic; there is just no way Jamal's life could have worked out in such a way that he would know the right answers.But if you think this is a criticism of the film, all I can say is that I'm really quite sorry for how seriously you take yourself. Great stories are not about the real world; great stories tell us about a world that could be, and make it seem almost as real to us as the world we live in. Slumdog Millionaire is a fairy tale for the ages, and for all its unrealism, is an uplifting and inspiring story of determination, love, and destiny. While I would say that I am often too eager to cut films some slack and give them 10 out of 10 just because I enjoyed myself thoroughly watching them, I have no qualms about giving Slumdog Millionaire a perfect 10. I would give it 11 if I could. This is a movie that deserves it.A side-note on issues of realism: although I have never lived in India, I visited Kolkata for a week and the slums and way of life I saw were very similar to that depicted in the movie. I come from a multi-ethnic country with many Indians and huge income disparities; I have socialised with both the wealthy elite and the squatters living nearly hand to mouth. I can easily tell you that Slumdog Millionaire is off in many ways. But every timeless tale is not quite accurate, and I don't hear anyone ragging on Snow White or George Washington's cherry tree for their realist faux pas. Slumdog Millionaire is a beautiful story, and while I'm not sure it stands in that class, it is one of the most amazing things to have ever been filmed. Watch it.",1
"There has already been some talk coming from Telluride that this film is set to be this year's 'Juno.' It does have the same distributor and it is set for the same release period, and for anyone who hears this buzz, they will definitely not be disappointed.During the premiere of the final cut (in the words of director Danny Boyle) at the Toronto International Film Festival, the audience gave the film an incredibly enthusiastic response, and it went on to win the People's Choice Award. Boyle, who is somewhat like a British Richard Linklater for yet again surprising the audience with such diverse subject matter, worked his magic. He transcended genres and created a truly unique and energetic picture.Just about every aspect of this film deserves merit, and above all it belongs to Boyle, who managed to assemble such a massive achievement. The score by A. R. Rahman, with contributions from M. I. A., perfectly accompanies the action on screen. Still, it is great enough to be listened to on its own. With India as a backdrop, Boyle and his cinematographer have composed some remarkable images. The acting is roundly impressive, especially coming from the younger cast, almost all of which has never acted before.The film begins as Jamal (Skins' Dev Patel) is under interrogation by Mumbai police for cheating on India's version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire, being only one question away from winning it all. As the inspector says, even doctors and lawyers cannot come close to the 20m rupee prize, and so Jamal, having grown up on the streets of Mumbai, cannot possibly know these things. As Jamal tries to avoid further torture, he begins to explain to the police how he knew each of the answers. Flashbacks present Jamal's boyhood and explain how he got to the show.At the centre of his journey is his brother, Salim, and a girl, Latika, who is left a homeless orphan after an attack that took Jamal's mother as well. After running from a man who exploits the trio for labour, Jamal replays the incident when Latika left his life when she was unable to catch a moving train. His uncertainty of her fate on the streets of Mumbai and his intense desire to see his first and only love again lead him to the interrogation room where the film began.Like 'Juno,' Slumdog Millionaire is by genre a comedic drama, but it becomes much more. The film asks questions about fate, righteousness, greed, and even urban sprawl. Above all, however, it asks about love in the face of the most dire obstacles, and if it can truly prosper. Jamal's story is a tragic and unfortunate one, but as seen through his eyes, it is still beautiful. The vast colour palate of India overwhelm any negative feelings, and Jamal's hope of finding and being with Latika overwhelm despair. For Jamal, 20m rupees isn't his prize. It would be nearly impossible for there to be a better picture this year.",1
"Since it received no less than 8 Oscars, I foresaw that Slumdog would not be of my liking, but I was frankly still baffled that the picture did not even meet my poorest of expectations, turning out to be just another overcheesed melodrama and an altogether quixotic mess of a film.With leads totally bereft of any charisma and zero chemistry between them, I progressively wondered who exactly I was supposed to root for. I think at some point I went for the game show host, since he was apparently paying the game money out his own pocket? and was obviously the victim of a swindle, much like myself.Come on, people don't instantly become of interest or garner sympathy just because they had a rough time. It takes a believable backdrop, a solid script and character development to achieve this. This picture fails terribly on all these counts and does so rather conspicuously, much like a cartoon or a parody. Oh, this was a realistic portrait of a typical slum in Bombay? They must have recently painted and vacuumed the place then.Heavy handed and utterly contrived situations furthered my annoyance as the movie turned into an inconceivable question and answer game where queue back sequences, in perfect chronological alignment, conveniently allowed the main lead to be able to rush through the game show, never showing the proper emotion or physical reaction such a tense situation surely would bring. No wonder the comic book villain cops didn't buy the lead's explanation that he simply knew all the answers. Our poor lead is beaten and tortured as the morally bankrupt cops try to force out a confession. But after a few weepy lifetime tales, the cop miraculously turns from foe to friend acting like the father one never had. Please give us a break.And what was up with these kids being able to speak perfect English all of a sudden? Since when is the WWTBAM show broad-casted live? Since when do you only need to answer 6 questions in this quiz and what in God's name is so glorious or symbolic about being shot to death in a bathtub full of money? Why is it that nowadays films with a story line that would really only be suitable for young children with its simplistic and utterly unrealistic plot points, seem so fit to gather so much general acclaim from a mature audience? I know people are easy to manipulate with these sorts of rags to riches claptrap, but surely this level of schmaltz and insultingly lame and predictable story progression would open up a few eyes here and there?I guess that the better the movies come, the worse they actually are.",1
"A lot of buzz when this film came out, both from movie goers and the industry itself. Since I'm usually well behind the curve on pictures like this, my reaction today with almost a decade gone by is that I don't see what the fuss was all about. It may have been a good old fashioned rags to riches story, but it was a contrived rags to riches story. One expects the kind of coincidence needed to carry a story forward in films of the Forties, Fifties or Sixties, but this was 2008, and seemed to require some lazy writing to pull off. To wit, each and every question that Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) was presented, there was some association with it during his past life. I won't deny that there may be occasional times when some element of cosmic serendipity enters one's life but the repetition that took place here defied the laws of probability. And the idea that Jamal would actually be hauled off and tortured by authorities because they thought he cheated, well I don't know, that seemed brutally excessive, don't you think? I think the game show moderator, if he felt that his popularity was being challenged by the chai wallah whiz kid, could have fixed the show's questions with ones that no one could have possibly answered. Heck, I got half of them myself with a lucky guess or two, same as Jamal. Well, you just never know. Best Picture with four additional Oscar Wins? Good deal if you can pull it off, but I just don't see it.",1
"I also saw this film at to Toronto Film Festival. The audience gave it a well deserved standing ovation. This story is told seamlessly. The revealing look into the Mumbai slum is just one of the beautiful and terrifying story lines. The use of flashbacks to tell the story took you on a journey in time and culture. They used three sets of actors of three different ages to move the story. The use of the youngest actors (actually slum kids from Mumbai) stole the show. These kids were incredible showing both the beauty and the horrors of growing up in Bombay. And that's not to take away from the amazing performances of Freida, Dev, and the actor playing the older Saleem. There performances moved many to tears. See this movie it won't disappoint!",1
"This is a story set in the slums of Mumbai, about two orphaned brothers who grow up on the streets. Like ""City of God"" (set in the slums of Rio De Janeiro), one of the boys is good (Jamal) and one is bad (Salim). They both love the same woman (Latika). Each brother watches out for each other as they grow up, but it's clear that Salim is a ruthlessly violent character.The story begins with Jamal playing for the top prize on an Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionairre"". Before he can play for the top prize, the show ends & he is asked to return the following day to finish the game. However, the game show host suspects the boy is cheating & has the police take him away for questioning. The police brutally interrogate Jamal, but he does not break down & confess, but, re-counts his upbringing on the Mumbai streets to show how he was able to gather the knowledge to correctly answer the questions on the show. In the process, the story of his life unfolds.This is an excellent movie. While it is clearly an Indian cast and setting, the language is English. It's a very clever fusion of Hollywood & Bollywood. The cinematography was stunning, the music was great, the characters very engaging, the plot was excellent, with an ending that tied up everything beautifully.I highly recommend this movie.",1
"I just saw this at the Savannah Film Festival (on Friday October 31st, 2008), held by the Savannah College Of Art and Design (SCAD) and as soon as the credits started rolling for this movie the first word that came out of my mouth was ""WOW!!!"" This movie is easily one of the best of 2008, I honestly don't know how the people have given this movie a average rating of 7 here on IMDb. This movie is the heart wrenching tale of a person who has everything he ever loved taken away from him, only to try with everything that he has to regain his true love and gain more than he could ever hope. It is preformed and put together in such a way that it forgets and bypasses every love story cliché. The movie starts out a little confusing but is very quickly sorted out and understood. Danny Boyle has made a film that inspires and encourages people of all ages.To summarize the deep and perfectly delivered message of this movie; you don't have to be a genius to know the answers in life, sometimes life is just written(whether you call it fate or destiny). This movie I'm sure will find its place amongst the great love movie's like ""The Princess Bride"", ""Casablanca"", and ""Titanic"". Some people I know have problems over the fact that this movie takes place in India, but if you just for one moment let go of that and watch this movie you will instantly find out just how amazing this movie is.Even though I am writing this review now in November, I hope that you will read this review when the film comes out officially in January and go out and see it. BECAUSE WHETHER YOU GO INTO THAT THEATER ALONE; WITHOUT A GIRLFRIEND OR NOT, YOU WILL WALK OUT OF THAT THEATER INSPIRED, ENCOURAGED, HOPEFUL, BUT MOST OF ALL IN LOVE WITH THIS FILM.For my closing statement I need to mention that recently this film got an undeserving ""R"" rating, but this is one movie you should not be ashamed to have your parents take you to see. And is the perfect movie to take a loved one to.",1
"With eight Oscar wins (including one for Best Picture), you can't help but assume this will be one of the best films ever made. Well, although it is very good, it's hard for ANY film to live up to this much hype I was a bit disappointed as a result.I began watching the film with my wife and oldest daughter, a short way into the film my wife left--saying the film was just too violent and depressing. Well, it IS both of these things and shows in awful detail what life can be like for the poor orphans of Mumbai. Vomiting, a kid jumping into a pool of excrement and evil thugs deliberately blinding kids--this movie WILL make you flinch and comes by the R-rating honestly. Now I am NOT suggesting they should have completely cleaned it all up--after all, this is a terrible sort of life and showing it any other way would be wrong. But, be forewarned--this is a very tough film to watch--especially in the first half hour.I would talk more about the film except it has already been reviewed 10000000000 times--and adding my two-cents worth isn't going to add much that hasn't already been written. Extremely well acted and constructed--this is a fine film.Perhaps the Oscar nominees that year were really bad. I dunno. All I do know is that this film probably has killed the Indian travel industry!!!",1
"Young Jamal (Dev Patel) is a contestant on the verge of winning 20 million rupees on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" How it is it possible that orphaned ""slumdog"" Jamal can answer all the questions so far, when so many others have failed? Sergeant Srinivas (stalwart Saurabh Shukla) would also like to know, in his interrogation of suspected cheat Jamal. I had heard about much of the storyline of Director Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" prior to finally seeing it. The ""Millionaire"" game show plot device initially on the surface seems contrived, as a way for Writer Simon Beaufoy to explore the story of Jamal through a series of riveting and captivating flashbacks.However, about half an hour through the movie I got it: ""It's about the girl."" Perhaps, midway through, there is a scene of movie magic where direction, story, and performance culminate together. Jamal waits for the love of his life Latika (stunningly beautiful Freida Pinto) at the train station. Jamal is distraught thinking Latika has dismissed him. Suddenly, she arrives. She looks up and sees Jamal, and lets out a smile. Not a word is spoken. It's about the girl.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a timeless love story, and the best movie of the year. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" follows the story of Jamal, Latika, and Jamal's older brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) from the time they were orphaned children to now. Theirs is a story of tragedy, innocence lost, courage, and love. Danny Boyle is the mesmerizing and poignant storyteller. Simon Beaufoy's screenplay based on the novel ""Q & A"" by Vikas Swarup is beautiful and touching. All the actors, who play the lead characters at various stages of their lives, are amazing and authentic. Boyle generates the enrolling spirit throughout ""Slumdog Millionaire""-- the story he tells is passionate and inspiring.Jamal and Salim become orphans as children following a Muslim massacre. They befriend orphaned Latika. Latika is destined to become the love of Jamal's life. They are all taken in by a ruthless group that enslaves children as beggars. Jamal and Salim manage to escape, but lose Latika. Years later Jamal and Salim rescue Latika, but at the cost of Salim's very soul. Salim chooses the dark path, one from which he can not return. Jamal is really now alone. His redemption may lie in ""Millionaire"", but not for the obvious reasons. His is for love and for Latika.Eventually, Jamal reunites with Salim and grown up Latika. Life has not turned out as all had envisioned. At the story arc Jamal confesses to Latika, ""I love you."" She replies, ""It's too late."" She implores Jamal, ""Forget me."" Dev Patel and Freida Pinto are amazing, and the heart and soul of ""Slumdog Millionaire"". Yes, it's about the girl. More to the point: it's about the power of the human spirit, and love. There is tremendous pain and suffering, and at the same time deep compassion, selfless sacrifice, and redemption. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a very special movie.",1
"This is an extraordinary film. From the original concept of the novel on which it is based (Q&A by Vikas Swarup), the screenplay by Simon Beaufoy (Full Monty) but especially the masterful creation and direction of the film by Danny Boyle. From the opening moments until the final scene, the audience was fully engaged. I was completely lost in the world that Danny Boyle created. This is not a story that has been told and retold, hashed and rehashed. It is fresh and engaging - all at once quickly moving, romantic, violent, culturally insightful, desperate and slightly fantastic. There are some comic elements to the film but to describe it as a ""comedy"" seems inappropriate. The film was shot on location in India, mostly in Mumbai. Slumdog Millionaire is yet another testament to depth and range of Boyle's artistic talent who has directed such diverse films as Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, 28 Days Later and Sunshine.I saw the film on at the 2008 Telluride Film Festival as a ""sneak preview."" The film was introduced by Boyle who said that the official opening of the film would be the next weekend at the Toronto Film Festival. He also said that there may be some final tweaking of the film prior to Toronto.In the discussion after the film Boyle strongly recommended three Indian made films: Satya, Company and Black Friday. He described each as superb. Boyle also stated that a portion of the Slumdog Millionaire was shot with a Canon EOS still camera, especially around the Taj Mahal, rather than a proper movie camera which creates unwanted attention while filming at popular tourist locations in India.8.2",1
"I found this to be an interesting film; certainly not boring as I had heard from a few people who saw it in the theater. To me, it was simply good storytelling.Yes, it's slow, especially by today's movie standards, but it's certainly a unique story and it's nicely filmed, acted and directed. Story-wise, it's one of those films I understand if people love it or hate it. I'm somewhat in the middle and leaning toward the positive.For a movie that runs for over 2 hours and 40 minutes and is not some suspense or action film, it has to be pretty good to hold one's interest. I can only speak for myself; it held my interest for 95 percent of it.I think the first two-thirds of the movie is the best. Brad Pitt as ""Benjamin Button"" is pretty fascinating, as is the story of him growing up from a wrinkled, old man-baby to a mid-40s guy. When he re-unites with childhood friend ""Daisy"" (Cate Blanchett) and becomes her lover, the film bogs down in a few spots but few people are going to stop watching after investing two hours. It picks up again, especially in the last minutes when ""Benjamin"" begins to finally become younger than an adult.There's a sadness to this story, especially near the end but overall, even though it's central theme seems to be ""death,"" I don't think it's a depressing film. It does remind us, in a big way, that the longer we're around, the more death of friends and loved ones we witness. That's just a sad fact of life. I hear about it all time with my father, who is 91 years old and has seen almost all of his friends die.It's especially true in this story when Benjamin starts off and has a lot of old friends to begin with! ""Benjamin"" was an odd person to me; you could root for him, yet not admire him. He often treated people only to satisfy his desires and could have been so much more. Yet, being ""a fly on the wall"" and observing his interesting life, was memorable, making this a film worthy of the time invested to watch it.In the end, the movie made me appreciate the friends I do have, and not to take any of them for granted as life passes us by so fast, no matter what direction we're headed!",1
"From PASTO, COLOMBIA-Via: L. A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL-----------The ONLY TONY KISS CASTILLO on FaceBook!--------------There are moments in life where we all feel ""different""! In the Curious Case of Benjamin Button, on the one-way highway of life, Benjamin Button lived and died...going the wrong way. Well, at least, COASTING ......The wrong way.And therein lays perhaps the great flaw/conundrum in David Fincher's film: For 2 hours and 40 minutes, ""Button"" seems content to meander aimlessly and unhurriedly toward its, and his own, inevitable conclusion. Thusly, it must be frankly said that BUTTON, at times so languidly paced...prompts us to ask, was Fincher, the director, as appears to be the case with his lead character, seemingly not knowing or caring where he was going... If any place at all? What a shame! Because the basic premise is nothing short of breathtakingly original. Perhaps one of the most original concepts to arrive on the screen in the past decade! I will admit that I am conflicted on this point.Perhaps the seeming pointlessness of Button's retro-existence is a bit of a metaphor for our own lives, which, in the long term scheme of things, end up, do what we may, whether we like it or not, being hollow, devoid of purpose, simply inertia-driven and without any real merit or worthwhile impact. It shakes up our mindset, casting a shadow of doubt over our entire life/death belief system. In that sense, Fincher's film haunts me as almost no other film has. If this was one of his goals in making BUTTON, I would say he was quite successful!Visually, this film borders on miraculous. Three well-deserved Oscars in Art Direction, Make-up and Visual Effects certainly back up my last statement. However, none of what you see is in-your-face. Every minute detail seems delicately integrated in a blissfully natural tapestry that is nothing short of inspired.On that note, let's look at Brad Pitt's performance in the title role.. An actor who, ever since his twitchy, neurotic, paranoid Jeffrey Goines in 12 MONKEYS, has never ceased to amaze us and certainly does not disappoint as the soft-spoken Button. Pitt's interpretation convincingly shows us a human being who has adapted to his unique condition and who has learned to take life one day at a time, virtually expectation free! Kate Blanchett as Daisy is superb! The singularity of the nature of her relationship with Button allows her to take the audience into uncharted cinematic territory and, oh, what a delicate and sophisticated journey she takes us on! David Fincher's Benjamin Button surely is an ageless film for the ages!10********** ..... ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are most welcome!",1
"if you've not watched this film yet then go see it, its a beautiful film. brilliantly crafted by one of my favourite and best directors around ""David Fincher""...... both the leads in this should of won Oscars, especially Brad Pitt. Just seeing him going through the aging process backward in the film is beyond brilliance. Cate Blanchett is very good too as the women Brad Pitts character loves in the film. All of the actors really give it their personnel best in this timeless classic. The film is fairly straight forward even though it is weird, Brad Pitts character was born old and through the years of his life he starts to grow younger and younger. It's just an epic journey through the life of what this man comes across. The film is on for about 3 hours but when I watched it that time went very quick. I do think longer films are so much better than short ones for the fact that they are more descriptive and you can get amazed by the story more. I'm so glad this won 3 Oscars even though it could have won more. It's not Fincher's best work but it's sure a film that won't be forgotten........ 10/10....... j.d seaton",1
"I don't have too much to say about this film, except that it was one of the most beautiful, touching, poignant, and bittersweet films I have ever seen.Benjamin Button lives his life in reverse. Despite this, it's a great life, full of adventure and love and learning. He finds out that no matter what, it's the people who make life so special.The film is beautifully photographed and true to the periods it represents.Brad Pitt is fantastic, and those CGI and makeup techniques for him and the rest of the cast are marvelous. It's a tribute to the film that it's very organic to the cast so we are not aware of makeup and CGI. Cate Blanchett is incredible; she is a dying, old woman in the beginning and gives a tremendous performance.We're born helpless and without life memories, and some of us die that way. In a way, I guess, it doesn't matter if you're born old or die old - it's like Benjamin tells Cate Blanchett in the film, you'd still end up where you are now. The life experience, the people you meet, the wisdom you acquire, all happens -- and it happened to Benjamin at a time when he could really value it. But as he points out: ""For what it's worth: it's never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. There's no time limit, stop whenever you want. You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it.""",1
"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button sure got a lot of attention when it came out in 2008. It got so much attention that it received three Oscars and is ranked in the IMDb Top 250--currently at #247. And, as a result, when I finally got around to seeing it, my expectations were way, way too high. I was expecting too much, I am sure, as it's hard for a film to live up to all this hoopla. Now if I look at the film and try to ignore all these ridiculously high expectations, I see that it is indeed an exceptional film...but perhaps not quite the 'must-see' that I thought it was. I can't put my finger on it...it just didn't seem like a film a cinema freak must watch...though it was a nice, gentle viewing experience. And, after seeing this and ""Slumdog Millionaire"", I can see why ""Benjamin Button"" didn't capture the Best Picture Oscar.Probably the best way to describe this film is like ""Forrest Gump"" run in reverse...and without the laughs or meetings with presidents and all the celebrity status. That's because although Benjamin SHOULD be world famous for being the only person to ever live life backwards, curiously he isn't and people seem to almost take it in stride. In addition, and this part DID bother me, everyone's performance seemed way, way, way too restrained. There were very, very few emotional highs in the film--and even those were curiously subdued. To me, that's what's curious about this ""Curious Case""---why such an excellent film pulled its emotional punches throughout the film. As a result, when it should have been exciting, it wasn't...or not nearly enough. Still, it's well worth seeing...it has some lovely romantic elements and is a sweet film.",1
"Before seeing The Curious Case of Benjamin Button I wondered how I would react to the story of a man who is born old and gets younger as he grows up. Of all of the stories I have come across, this is by far the most bizarre and intriguing. If i had to pick someone to bring this story to the screen I do no think David Fincher would have been my first choice.How wrong I would have been. This film is by far one of the best if not the best of 2008. Fincher's direction is flawless! The film from start to finish does not let up. There are moments of joy and ecstasy followed by sorrow and understanding. Brad Pitt stars as Benjamin, a boy born an old man who must live his life in reverse. His friend from childhood, Daisy, is played by Cate Blanchett. The story is narrated from Benjamin's point of view with some particular highlights from Daisy.The cast does nothing wrong. Pitt leads with Blanchett and a strong performance from Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's surrogate mother Queenie, the only person in the world who seems to understand and truly love him from the start. Other cameos along the way bring a large array of characters, including Tilda Swinton, one of Benjamin's early love interests.The film spans from the end of World War I to the the arrival of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. The transitions from life stage to life stage and decade to decade are seamless. Fincher does a tremendous job at maintaining a steady flow of action and dialogue. There is not a dull moment in the film. The cinematography is superb and couples nicely with Fincher's style of accentuating certain colors to enhance a mood or moment.There really is nothing wrong with this film. Even with a runtime of about 160 minutes, time just flies by, much like it does for Benjamin, only we are going forward. This is a tender and meaningful film you do not want to wish.",1
"Other than F. Scott Fitzgerald's vivid description of how Benjamin Button has reversed the aging process in his life, there is nothing of his the plot of his story. But the idea behind the updated version is as vivid as when he put it to paper.When Fitzgerald published the story it was 1927 probably at the height of the jazz age and his creative powers. As he wrote it, Bnejamin Button was born after the Civil War and lived through World War I. But he lived backwards as it were. In Camelot, King Arthur describes Merlin as not aging, but that he 'youthens'. That coined word describes just what happens to Benjamin.When he's born he comes out of the womb a little old man, something like you might imagine Yoda if you can ever imagine him as a child. With all the usual problems of old age. But as he grows older chronologically, Benjamin loses all those infirmities gradually and gets younger and younger. Several actors play him before he finally morphs into Brad Pitt.Which makes the achievement of director David Fancher all the more impressive. Although Brad Pitt was recognized with an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, the directing of several others almost in tandem to play the same role at different stages is a great achievement. Too bad he didn't get the Oscar for that alone although Fancher was nominated also.In fact The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button got a flock of Oscar nominations including Best Picture as well as those mentioned. It won for Art&Set Direction, Visual Effects, and in fact if it hadn't won for makeup the Oscars should have been picketted that year.Taraji Henson was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress. When Benjamin is born and his mother dies giving him birth and his father abandons him, the caregiver who is black takes him in to raise in her large and extended family. Given both his physical condition and the circumstances of his childhood, Benjamin had one unique perspective on life indeed. Henson is nothing short of fabulous in her portrayal.Cate Blanchett who was overlooked in the Oscars for this role plays the woman whom he loves, but who is working her way up in physical age while Pitt is working down. The film is seen from both her's and his perspective as she tells her daughter to read from this diary that Benjamin kept. When they met at the middle though as Benjamin ran the bases backward through life, there love was real and really physical.The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button is a remarkable achievement that gave some career roles to some fine players.",1
"Possibly the most anticipated winter film of 2008, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a curious film indeed. It's got an intriguing and completely absorbing story, as well as my favorite director, David Fincher, on the top of his game. With ""Button"", Fincher cements his place as one of the best directors alive, as his film is nothing short of magical, mesmerizing, riveting, ground breaking, and ultimately, timeless.When I first heard about this movie, I had to wonder...how was Fincher, the guy responsible for realistic, gripping, crime thrillers like Seven and Zodiac going to pull off the fantasy film of a lifetime? Armed with a massive budget, Fincher uses everything a director can use to craft the most charming and technically brilliant film of the year. It's a film to be cherished for ages.""Button"" has struck me like this because a recurring theme in the film is that age is only a number, and that we as people can choose what we do with our lives, no matter what our age is. What better way to tell this message than through a story where the titular character ages backwards, and must experience life in such a way? How does one fall in love when he could one day appear young enough to be his spouse's child? How does a 5 year old play with the neighborhood children when he's confined to a wheelchair stricken with old age? Fincher's epic explores our choices, lives, and the timelessness of life itself.Brad Pitt plays the title role of Benjamin Button with a certain air of likability like he always does. While I felt he did a good job with the part, he didn't have to do much...Benjamin, fittingly, is a rather quiet character (I'd be willing to bet he narrates more than he actually talks in the film). In terms of acting, the film belongs to the ladies, Cate Blanchett and Taraji P. Henson in particular. Though Blanchett may seem overrated to some, there's no denying her unrivaled talent at playing a character as complex and deep as Daisy, and she pulls it off with ease and charisma. Taraji P. Henson will warm your heart as Benjamin's mother, as she's humorous, warm, and loving, so loving that I felt as if she was my mother.The main complexity behind the film, especially with a director like David Fincher, is keeping the film grounded in reality, while maintaining the undeniable magic within. As a director, you don't want to lose too much of either quality, instead keeping a healthy balance of the two. I feel that Fincher accomplished this perfectly. He is mainly helped out by a magical score, and absolutely stunning cinematography (which immediately identified it as a Fincher film, because of the darkness and lighting of it).Despite the wonder and awe of the film, mixed with the realism that Fincher always brings, the true allure of the film is not just Benjamin's aging problem, but the romance between Benjamin and Daisy, which is beautiful. Two people in love, regardless of age, time, or place. It's one of the most compelling romances of the year.""Button"" is also the most technically well made movie of 2008, as the true standouts are the Visual Effects and the Makeup, both of which are Oscar worthy. Pitt plays the character at almost every age, but it's almost impossible to tell when the CGI is being used on him. You know it's there, obviously, but you can't tell it's being used. When the transition is just smooth enough for the Visual Effects to be retired, but just rough enough to use makeup, it's absolutely perfect. If you've ever wanted to see Brad Pitt look 20 again, look no further, as the effects that make our actors young again (the same goes for Blanchett) are just as stunning as those that make them older.Despite a long runtime, the film never drags. If I had to point out one thing I would've liked to have seen a little more of, it would've been more of Benjamin as a little kid, as I felt that was rushed (for those who don't know what I mean, I mean the last parts of the film when he's old, but his body is young). This doesn't hurt the film in any way, as it's just my wishful thinking.I know I've used the word 'magical' a lot in this review, and don't think it's on accident. If I could pick one word to describe David Fincher's masterpiece, that would be it: magical. ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is a captivating piece of art that shouldn't be missed by anyone.",1
"Brad Pitt makes his mark as an actor here as Benjamin Button, a man with a strange disorder - physically aging backwards. Along his emotional journey of life he encounters friends, family, loved ones, adventures, and most of all, chances.Rarely has a film keeps the realism intact while still sustaining the magic of it. Truly, David Fincher and Pitt have created a film that is leaps and bounds ahead of its time. Taking a strange and fascinating tale and making it into one of the decade's very best films is something of an accomplishment.Pitt, here, is an actor, not just a pretty face anymore. With the state-of-the-art visual effects at his hand, he pretty much carries the whole show. It is perhaps the first time since Andy Serkis' rendition of Gollum in The Lord of the Rings, that great acting has eclipsed terrific special effects. You genuinely feel and sympathize for his character, rooting for him all the way. Pitt owns the film, in short. He and David Fincher make a great team, and they look unstoppable to create more terrific films.For the supporting cast, Cate Blanchett plays the love interest of Daisy to great effect. Her tale with Benjamin's make them somewhat star-crossed lovers. I won't go that far into detail but you'll see much later into the film. Taraji P. Henson also shines as Benjamin's surrogate mother, who gives her son the support he needs. Not to mention Tilda Swinton as an early love interest.The screenplay by Eric Roth is excellent. Told from Benjamin's point of view with some highlights by Daisy, there are no clichéd dialogs to be heard, and the script is filled with equal moments of joy, ecstasy, sorrow, and understanding. Some dialog here is timeless and quotable, such as the film's tag-line; ""We are defined by opportunities, even by the ones we miss."" When you age backwards, you get more chances rather than missing it. I love that and wish for it, but sadly that is what movies are made for. And if that is what you've been thinking after or during your viewing of this film, then this film has succeeded.David Fincher is a tour-de-force of film-making. Straying away from gritty violent thrillers such as ""Zodiac"", the unmatched ""Fight Club"", and ""Se7en"", he takes a bizarre love story, the most expensive budget he's faced, and crafts a film with such substance and flair that he adds quality to the film. There are moments in the film which make it obvious Fincher is calling the shots. The paced is slow, but this allows us to absorb and be infatuated with the characters. There is not one dull moment in the film. It is constantly gripping and re-watchable.Technically speaking, the cinematography and lighting is absolutely perfect; gorgeous to the eyes and senses, and while giving the right tone and feel to the film shows us director Fincher's trademark. Accompanying this is the beautiful and heart-wrenching score by Alexandre Desplat, which is absolutely flawless. The special effects are unique and well-made, and you'll find yourself confused to whether certain scenes were made with special effects or not. If you want to see actors when they were young this is the best rendition of effects possible, and I hope the future movies use more of this amazing technology to make their stars more bankable. The special effects deserve their Oscar for it is the best I've seen in any movie in 2008.In short, it is a beautiful, tragic, and terrific movie. It is certainly timeless and will stand the test of time, and hopefully, age well like fine wine (no pun intended). This absolute gem deserves the nominations it gets, too bad it was released the same year as Slumdog Millionaire.Overall rating: 9/10",1
"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was a near epic film in almost the same way Forrest Gump was. I am not particularly a fan of David Fincher and his work. Yet I strongly admired The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. This film is about a man named Benjamin Button who leads much of an ordinary life under not so ordinary circumstances. The one thing that separates him from any other human being is that he ages backwards. Despite such large differences between the audience and Benjamin Button, the film finds a way to connect with a large variety of people in a way that does not seem to happen so often.The acting was very good throughout the movie. Especially that of Cate Blanchett who seems to be turning out one great performance after another. She plays the role of Daisy, Benjamin Button's real love interest from start to finish. In fact she played so well it might have been a partial downfall to the movie. Her performance out shined that of the main character, played by Brad Pitt. Although Pitt was very solid in his performance I do not believe he deserved an Oscar nomination (rather Blanchett deserved one) for his role of playing Benjamin Button. He was not a necessity to the movie and did not add much to it. He was not bad but he wasn't spectacular. Throughout though many of the different actors and actresses lit up the screen. Especially Tilda Swinton who was wonderful to watch as Button's short lived love interest. Her presence was magical and a joy to watch. I would have loved to see just a little bit more of her character.The directing of David Fincher in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was of what I believe to be his best work to date. The screenplay of Eric Roth was written very well as he has had experience with these type of movies. In many scenes the dialog and great direction combined for some epic scenes.Ultimately I enjoyed this movie very much but something felt missing from the movie. Something seemed left unsaid that was vital. I felt that the great downfall to this movie was that Brad Pitt didn't give an amazing performance and did not take control of the movie rather Blanchett stole the show from him which made Button seem less important to me. Despite that though it this film was done very well and I would recommend it to all. Its an important story that makes us self reflect and think deeply. It displays how we need to live with our mistakes because they are part of our life. We need to appreciate what we have rather than wonder ""what if...?"".",1
"Fincher understands cinematic narrative construction and has the craft to match. I fell under his spell during ""Fight Club.""The idea there was to play a game with inner narrative. It was, I think when Pitt first found his way into full collaboration with a director's adventure with the shifting of watcher and writer. That made Pit a real actor in my book. Fincher has played with other devices since. ""Panic Room"" was architectural, at least to begin. ""Zodiac"" twisted the detective story in odd ways. Here he works with one of the most basic challenges in film: how to show the internal workings of a mind in emotional seas. The conventional way in literature is easy enough for us now: we read about what we believe are the inner ruminations and remembrances of a mind. But that makes for bad films -- where we have all sorts of talk, explanations in words instead of immersion in experience through the visual grammar. These are the worst.But what if you want to tell a real love story? One of real love, deep love, impossible love? What if you want it directly from the lover's hearts and don't want some metaphoric overlay, some watered down convention? Well, you might try this collection of devices, these two.First there is the inter-nested story. We have the framing narrative of the clockmaker and his love. (This, incidentally, is one way to show love, to conflate it with something visual, like clocks, stations, hurricanes, lightning.) We leave that and come to an inner framing story, a dying woman still calculating, revealing secrets to a daughter. This is actually a pretty conventional setting as well. We revisit it enough to allow for an excuse for her to ""read"" from a diary, the excuse for us to hear the inner thoughts and emotions of Benjamin. This one device gives blanket allowance, and the casual viewer will scarcely notice that we get the inner beats of the woman's heart as well, in her own ""words.""This is combined with the more visible device of two lover's lives running in opposite directions. We go forward while the story is recalled as double memory, triple if we credit Ormand's character (the daughter) as the one going in reverse. And this IS conveyed cinematically by the somewhat hypnotic device of seeing the familiar face of Brad Pitt reverse age. It sounds simple, this concoction, but I imagine it to take the focused efforts of all involved, including the two women: our most talented folding actors (both redheads here) Cate Blanchett and Tilda Swinton. Along the way, Fincher almost teases us with what he does not do. There is the ""Doctor Zhivago"" route not taken, the war movie route, the dancer (performance as love), the Ron Howard play (""Cocoon""), the Spielberg play, in fact all the possible ratholes that all the possible directors who were once attached would have gone down. Yes, it is slow. Love is. Yes, it is difficult, but this love is -- all deep love is. All lasting love is a passing moment, captured and nurtured internally while it tries its best to vanish. Is this the best, truest love story in ages? Yes, probably. Will it change you? Possibly, depending on where your heart passes.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",1
"In New Orleans, while in her deathbed, the elder Daisy (Cate Blanchett) asks her daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond) to read the journal of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) for her. Caroline reads the fascinating story of a man that was born a diseased old man on the day that the First World War ended; abandoned by his desperate father Thomas Button (Jason Flemyng) in an asylum for elders and raised as a son by the black caregiver Queenie (Taraji P. Henson). While aging backwards, Benjamin meets the girl Daisy and they become friends; then he works as a sailor in the towboat Chelsea and travels through the world, participating of the World War II after the attack to Pearl Harbor; finds love with Mrs. Elizabeth Abbott (Tilda Swinton) and returns to New Orleans, when he meets his biological father and Daisy, who is working as ballerina in New York until he finally dies as a baby. While reading the diary, Caroline discloses a secret about her family.""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is one of the most intriguing movies ever. The original story is supported by an interesting and curious screenplay that discloses the whole life of Benjamin Button and a stunning direction of David Fincher. The cast is magnificent, and it is not easy to highlight an individual performance (I loved Cate Blanchett), supported by magnificent cinematography and make-up. Surprisingly there are bad reviews of this movie that I recommend for those viewers that seeks a gem that is unique. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""O Curioso Caso de Benjamin Button"" (""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"")",1
"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film unlike any I've ever seen and probably ever will. A true epic that left me utterly speechless. It accomplished so much through such simplicity. Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The film demands you to feel not only for the death we witness, but for the incredible life we discover. It prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same way. This is a momentous tale that deserves nothing less than the title of brilliance. This visually and emotionally rich movie recalls the life of a very peculiar man born in the early 20th century who ages backwards. His tale unfolds through a diary read by the daughter of his love, Daisy. Throughout life he goes through the same things we do, growing up and eventually growing old. He's a thoughtful observer, discovering life from all different angles. But it is not his life that makes him unique. His love is what makes him special. He spends a lifetime trying to understand how his love for Daisy works and still only gets a few incredible years really loving her. As their lives tell us, the years of frustration and hardship are all worth it if only for a few moments of happiness. The direction in the film is almost flawless. Hopefully, Benjamin Button will garner David Fincher the recognition he deserves. He winds this clock so well and with such grace that the movie has this undeniable flow that is enjoyable from start to finish. At nearly 3 hours, there is not a minute wasted. Every shot is jaw dropping and while some will find issue with the time, it is used wisely. The acting is also a thing of wonder. This is by far Brad Pitt's best performance. He is so believable and realistic throughout. His nuances are spot on and despite the heavy use of make-up and CGI used to portray his character, it is Pitt who makes Benjamin that much more curious. I left the theater astonished that some one could review this movie badly. It is an extremely graceful depiction of life, love, and the things we lose. After so much anticipation I was certainly not disappointed. This movie is probably not for everyone though. It's not your average drama that spoon feeds it's audience their emotions. It is something of awe and astonishment, an absolute gem. What makes our lives memorable are the moments we never seem to grasp long enough before letting go. Life in itself is indeed very, very curious and Benjamin Button is no less of a wonder.",1
"I think this film works as an example of how ordinary human beings can do extraordinary things when they have a desire to overcome their limitations and seek out a greater world outside themselves. The story is a uniquely creative and original one, told from the perspective of one principal character aging normally, and the other regressing after having been born 'an old man'. Their lives 'intersect' at the age of forty three, at which point Benjamin (Brad Pitt) begins coming to grips with the idea that he and Daisy (Cate Blanchett) are ultimately destined to live out their lives in separate ways. I do have a problem though with the timing of Benjamin's departure. The movie did a terrific job of restoring him back to a youthful looking young man over time, and it seemed to me that he could have enjoyed at least a decade with his daughter before heading off to parts unknown. His admonition that he didn't want to be her 'playmate' seemed hollow when Caroline was just a small child and he was still in his thirties. So that part of the story I think could have been handled a bit better. But otherwise, I thought this was a cleverly written story that also managed to reflect warmly on the racial component of having Benjamin raised by a black woman (Taraji P. Henson) who he considered his Mama. Interjecting the story with those humorous moments of the seven times lightning man was also quite brilliant, lending some welcome comic relief moments to a story that tended to get somber at times.",1
"This film is worthy of a 10/10 rating simply because of its imaginative and complex nature, I mean, I couldn't bring myself to know why this simple idea of a man aging backwards hadn't sprouted up before. Set all the way back at the end of the Great War, to New Orlean's meeting with Hurricane Katrina, this movie tells the story of Benjamin Button, a baby born an old man of eighty, destined to die in the mere form of a zero-year-old. I found this movie very emotional and special because there's reeally nothing like it. I honestly thought, when I found out the immense length of the film, it was going to be boring....I was wrong, it gripped me from start to finish. There are many emotional and touching scenes in it, including the end, where it brings forth Benjamin Button's 'younger' years as an old man. Nothing went wrong with the cast, Brad Pitt played a great job as a reverse-aging man, and Cate went well as his childhood friend. Overall, this movie was great and I recommend it to anyone who loves the genre.",1
"F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' has been transformed into a splendid film by David Fincher. A marvelously made film, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is one of the best movies of 2008. The cast is terrific and director David Fincher beautifully puts together the tale of Benjamin's life. The only large flaw many will find is that the concept of the film's premise seems too unrealistic.The film tells the life of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt). Born as an old man, Benjamin ages backwards; gradually getting younger as those around him age normally. Benjamin is abandoned at birth and picked up at an old-age home. As a child - or rather as a hunched over 80 year old - he meets a girl named Daisy (Cate Blanchett). Together they engage in innocent child games, and through this they develop a special connection. As Benjamin goes off into the world, Daisy continues to grow up, later pursuing her dream of dancing. Benjamin joins a crew and sails round the world, ending up in Russia. Then, after Pearl Harbor, Benjamin joins in the war effort, following battles across the north Pacific and only engaging in one combat situation.Returning to New Orleans, Benjamin has grown taller, lost many of his wrinkles, and grown more hair. The visual effects are spectacular in following Brad Pitt through the various stages of his life. From an old man to a young teen, Benjamin always resembles Pitt. Upon arrival in his childhood home, Benjamin learns that many of the tenants he knew have passed on. This is the tragedy of aging backwards, those you knew continue to age forward as they exit this world while you do the opposite. Benjamin also meets Daisy again, who after many years has become a successful dancer and has blossomed into a beautiful young woman. Long gone is the innocence of childhood, and Daisy has become intimate with many men in New York City. Missing by an inch, she and Benjamin do not initiate a relationship until later in the film.Narrated from the present, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button starts with Daisy's daughter reading Benjamin's diary to her mother in a hospital on the cusp of Hurricane Katrina. This allows the narration to occasionally halt for an elderly Daisy to comment on events of her life. A key motif running throughout this film is time. Beginning and ending with sequences about the same clock, David Fincher seems to allude to the notion that things fade, and that we must hold on to the things we love in the time we have with them.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a fantastic film. Beautifully created, David Fincher paints an image of the south of the United States in the early 1900s which seems both realistic and fantastical. The film also illustrates war, travel, death, and many of the other events of life. Brad Pitt shows emotional depth as Benjamin, and Cate Blanchett is terrific as Daisy. It is surprising how much we can take away from a 166 minute movie, the audience feels as if they have known Benjamin and Daisy for all of their lives. While some may question the premise of the film, arguing that time is linear and that the plot is therefore incoherent, there can be no arguing that this film does its best to develop human relationships and to establish emotional connections between characters. As Roger Ebert once said, ""A film is not about its subject; it's about how it's about its subject"", and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button certainly handles its subject material splendidly.",1
"a strange thing -to assume a not comfortable text for give to it new nuances. to chose the right actors. to send profound emotions who determine ignoring of make up and CGI. because the great virtue of film is the simplicity of story. nothing strange. nothing complicated. only a confession about essence of life. about a love story. about the struggle against time. it is a beautiful film for the manner to tell the story as to observe a river. serenity is the basic note. emotion is the obvious result. Brad Pitt remains, scene by scene, a revelation because he seems be part of his role , more than interpreter of it. he does more than a good job - he gives the perfect translation of solitude, joy, expectations and hope , perfect way for define Benjamin Button as reflection of the viewer. a film who impress. for its admirable simplicity.",1
"Brad Pitt is not just another handsome guy who's made it big in film. This guy is one hell of an actor who'll walk away with this year's Best Actor Oscar as will the movie garner 10 awards. It is simply a masterpiece; no words can aptly decribe the poignancy and beauty of this celluloid Renoir.Kudos to two geniuses who wrote it;Eric Roth and Robin Swicord,masters of imagination. To think of the idea whereby the march of time runs clockwise for the entire world but backwards for Benjamin is, in itself, masterful. The concept allows for the type of intersection of people and events which has never been shown on the screen previously. I suggest that no one reads anything about the plot because the entire impact of the film will be lost by doing so. See it with an open mind and you will be totally astounded for close to three hours. Every once in a while, a film of this brilliance comes along to take the public by storm, the last being ""Million Dollar Baby,"" therefore get set for another movie treat of a lifetime.Simply stated: this film is NOT to be missed.",1

Rating : 7.5/10. Better than average. The picture will appeal to Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett fans . Well worth watching.",1
"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, when I was working at a movie theater, I had seen the first hour of the movie, but never got to finish it. I was so disappointed because this movie looked like something truly special and finally I got to rent it, while I'm disappointed that I didn't finish it on the big screen this is one of the great movies out of 2008. Brad Pitt as we know has proved to be more then just a pretty face, he's pulled in some great performances, he needed a push though to get recognized by the academy and this was the role that he truly deserved to be noticed. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters that I'm sure will be remembered for all time, Benjamin Button, he plays the character with such love and passion, he and Cate Blanchett together once again to provide the perfect chemistry and make The Curious Case of Benjamin Button a very special movie.An elderly Daisy is on her deathbed with her daughter Caroline in a hospital as a hurricane approaches. Daisy asks Caroline to read aloud from a diary containing photographs and postcards written by Benjamin Button. Caroline begins to read as the story transitions to Benjamin's narration. In 1918, just as the people of New Orleans are celebrating the end of the Great War, a baby boy is born with the appearance and physical maladies of an elderly man. The mother of the baby dies shortly after giving birth, and the father, Thomas Button, takes the baby and abandons him on the porch of a nursing home. Queenie and Tizzy, a couple who work at the nursing home, find the baby. Queenie decides to take the baby in as her own. Over the course of the story, Benjamin begins to biologically grow younger. In 1930, while still appearing to be in his seventies, Benjamin meets a young girl named Daisy, whose grandmother lives in the nursing home. A few years later, Benjamin goes to work on a tugboat on the docks of New Orleans for Captain Mike. While in Russia, he begins an affair with the older, married Elizabeth. Eventually, she breaks it off, only leaving him a note telling him she was glad they met. In 1962, Daisy returns to New Orleans and meets Benjamin again. Now the same physical age, they fall in love and move in together. They experience the 1960s together, in large part blissfully but increasingly aware of Benjamin growing younger while Daisy grows older. Daisy gives birth to a girl, Caroline. Benjamin, believing he cannot be a father to his daughter due to his reverse aging, and not wanting to burden Daisy with having to raise two children, sells his belongings, and leaves the proceeds to Daisy and Caroline. He leaves them both and travels the world.If you get the chance, I highly recommend The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, this movie was just incredible in it's scope, story, setting and actors. David Fincher took what could have been just a small treasure and made it into something incredible. This was one of the saddest love stories I have seen in a long time, we really haven't had anything too special when it comes to a love story in film, we did have Slumdog Millionaire in 2008 as well, but The Curious Case of Benjamin Button carried it's love story throughout and made you really pity this couple that you know can't have much of a future together. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are absolutely beautiful in this movie along with a great supporting cast, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a movie not to be missed.9/10",1
Masterful storytelling. From beggining to the end absolutely flawless. It's enough to make a grown man cry.,1
"When this film was over (saw it on a late show on Christmas Day), I knew I had just experienced one of the most powerful cinematic masterpieces of my life. ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is quite possibly my favourite film of the last 5 years (not since Sofia Coppola's ""Lost In Translation"" a contemporary film had moved me so much). I had high expectations for it, and they were way surpassed (fact: after ""Se7en"", ""Fight Club"" and this, nobody will deny David Fincher and Brad Pitt make great films together).""Benjamin Button"" is the story of a man who ages backwards. Played and narrated by Brad Pitt, BB is the epic account of this extraordinary life, with focus on all the special women that were part of it (Taraji P. Henson as the mother, Cate Blanchett as the love interest and Tilda Swinton as a married woman he has an affair with). As a humorous, romantic, melancholic and visually stunning tale of a sweet-natured man who's different from most people, the film reminds me of ""Forrest Gump"" (which was also adapted to the screen by Eric Roth), but it is even more groundbreaking. It's hard to see a film that has it all, but TCCOBB is one of those. It's like a great epic from Hollywood's Golden Age, when a good story was as important as the magnificent sets (the art direction, cinematography and make-up are all fantastic, by the way, as is Alexandre Desplat's musical score) that populated them  something very rare today, when CGI dominates most movies. We had a few great films this year  from the king of blockbusters (Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"") to a compelling biopic (Gus Van Sant's ""MILK"") to brilliant indies like Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"", Mike Leigh's ""Happy-Go-Lucky"", Charlie Kaufman's ""Synecdoche, New York"", Thomas McCarthy's ""The Visitor"", Courtney Hunt's ""Frozen River"", Tomas Alfredson's ""Let The Right One In"" and Jonathan Demme's ""Rachel Getting Married"", but I doubt I will see anything as good as David Fincher's masterpiece so soon. In other words, an instant classic (there, I said it). 10/10.",1
"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is unlike any other films I've ever seen and most probably ever will. It is an absolute masterpiece and will most definitely be one of the greatest films of all time. An instant classic. It is layered with top notch acting, well-executed directing and a magical soundtrack. It explores the subject of life, love and death, the death of the ones we love, on losing and finding and how it all connects. This movie is nothing but brilliance. An epic that have left me breathless.It is a tale of Benjamin, a man who was born old and aged in reversed, and was told from the diary read by his daughter. It is not his condition that makes him special. It is the choices that he made throughout his story. He gets to witnessed life from all angles. While he is growing younger, the people around him grow old and eventually die. He learned that in order to know how much a person meant to us, we are made to lose them. Life is not measured in minutes, but in moments. That is why he left his home, go to sea, fight in a war, find love, have a child, and in the end, start all over again.The most curious part of the movie  for me  is its incredible attention to detail. The art of this movie is unlike anything I have seen before. It puts you directly into the period of time of what is shown on screen. Never was a movie so vastly detailed and lavishly put together as this. From the war scenes at seas, to the city during the winter, events in the cities, 1920s, 30s, 40s and so on; they will leave you speechless. Instead of just showing earlier times, we're shown historical (though with a dash of fiction) events and figures, like the WWII, President Roosevelt, some reference to Shakespeare, etc. Some of these scenes are in washed-out colours, like a footage taken straight from that time period. And especially the six ""struck-by-lightning"" scenes, which have no sounds, just white-and-black footage that last for about 2 seconds each. It really gives the authenticity of those moments.Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, on the other hand, had proved themselves that they can't only play variety of characters in variety of movies, but also characters living their lives while spanning decades and decades...all while in a movie. They are both so empathetic that audience can feel what they are depicting; how they grow, matured and developed. I get to see it in less than three hours. It has got nothing to do with the directing skill or the screenplay  they're just highly skilled actors.David Fincher used the three hours that was given to him very wisely. Not one scene seemed out-of-place or inappropriate. He directed the film so well that the graceful storytelling reflects his direction.It will be a curious thing how this movie gets awful reviews.It is a definite example of the most wonderful depiction of love, life and death. It will leave you astonished. Because what makes our life meaningful are not the choices we have made and not the things we have found, but instead, the opportunities that we strike even the ones we missed, and the ones we love and how they are gone. Life IS curious. And the Curious Case of Benjamin Button had thought me how to appreciate it.P/S: One of the last scenes in the movie is the most beautiful and touching picture I have ever seen; An old woman, cradling a baby, and knowing that both of them are dying...",1
"As of this writing, Benjamin Button is number 70 on IMDb's Top 250 movies of the year list. Many people believe this film deserves, in a year with films like Frost/Nixon and Doubt (and many others which I will not mention) that this is the one film which will bring home Best Picture.Wow. This is overrated. It will bring home the Oscars it deserves: Cinematography and Makeup, and if it's very, very, lucky, Special Effects. What bugs me most about the film is the thing at the core: the relationship between Daisy and Benjamin. It misses something very, very, important: why they fell in love in the first place.The most interesting section is one that completely captivated: when he has a love affair with a lady at the Russian hotel, why? Because they kept it at a brisk 30 minutes so it doesn't drag on for 2 hours, it gets you captivated, and it ends when it is meant to end. You can also tell why they had the affair in the first place: they wanted to find out to what it was like to be in love, or in the girls case: Benjamin's strange affliction.You (or at least me) become sick of Benjamin's relationship with Daisy when you realize it fails to ask the most important question at what is the dead center of the entire 2 hour 48 minute film: Why did they fall in love???Pitt gives a tolerable performance, nothing Oscar worthy. Blanchett, on the other hand was very good as Daisy, trying to fuel the chemistry with Pitt that just isn't there.It's also very long with a 168-minute runtime, it thinks it can spend all the time trying to win, but in the end, it fails. There are many useless scenes that could've been thrown out (particularly this one scene in which it shows all the things, which could've happened to prevent Daisy being hit by a cab, which leaves you thinking in the 5-minute section that feels more like 30 minutes which left me thinking ""when will this end???""). Worth a rental for the astounding cinematography and makeup.",1
"Technically, like most of Davin Fincher's movies, ""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button"" is a wonder. The curious saga of a man ageing backwards, gives Fincher the possibility of doing what he does best, tricks. It is the drama part that he doesn't seem to master or perhaps he doesn't care. ""Zodiac"" was his most coherent dramatic venture. Here he gets infatuated by the CGI and manages some spectacular punches but it is thanks to Brad Pitt the the exercise has a soul. He is truly remarkable. He manages to overcome the distraction of the gadgetry and show us the interior of the man. Brad Pitt's warmth wins over David Fincher's coldness and the most successful parts of the film are reflected in Brad Pitt's eyes. Geared towards an inexorable ending, there are moments of real beauty and tenderness. I'm convinced those moments could have been captured with a Super 8. The over direction of Fincher puts the emotional undertone in real jeopardy but, thankfully, the overall experience is mostly a welcome and rewarding one.",1
"From PASTO, COLOMBIA-Via: L. A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL ------------The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook!------------------The morning after the Watergate break-in, I brought the newspaper to my university, showing the brief article to everyone who would look. ""Tricky Dick is at the bottom of this"" I insisted! ""NO! He wouldn't be that STUPID!"" most of them replied.In FROST/NIXON we get an insightful look at a gifted, multi-faceted, conflicted personality in all its haunting glory. Nixon was many things. Stupid was not one of them. A Ron Howard Movie about a TV interview? I was very skeptical, to say the least. One viewing made me a believer. Ron Howard has crafted an instant Classic masterpiece. Ripe with couched metaphors and subtle tripwire dialog, the film's power flows from Ron Howard's ability to present us with the cinematic equivalent of a 100 minute TV close-up of its title characters.FROST/NIXON turns a microscope on both Nixon's strengths and a shopping list of inner demons. Simultaneously vindictive, petty, rancorous, insecure and ever ready to play the victim, more than anything else, Frank Langella's uncanny performance evokes not hatred, but great pathos. History is replete with flawed geniuses. But only during the past half century has there been a media obsessed with exposing them for the entire world to see.Michael Sheen is inspired as David Frost, undergoing a great on screen catharsis. And the re-creation of the interviews is sublime! Cleverly and convincingly Presented as two deftly talented sparring partners, FROST/NIXON is an immensely entertaining/informative slice of history that should satisfy even the most discerning cinematic gourmet.9*.....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are most welcome!",1
"The Frost/Nixon interviews are fascinating. Not every second of them, especially not when Nixon rambles on and on, avoiding questions by offering anecdotes in place of answers. Yet, they are an invaluable historical document, which allow us the rare privilege of seeing a major politician as a human being and nothing else. As interesting as the interviews themselves is the lead-up to them, the circumstances surrounding them, and the characters involved, particularly Frost and Nixon, of course. One could say that you only need to watch the actual footage, but there's ample room for a great dramatization, but it needed an even-handed approach, and certainly needed no political preaching.I have a personal dislike for Ron Howard as a director, a result of my sensibilities mainly, I suspect. Howard strikes me as a particularly heavy-handed, didactic director who has wasted many great concepts on mediocre films (out of 18 films I've seen by him, I only genuinely liked ""Apollo 13"". I was expecting the worst with ""Frost/Nixon"", but instead was met with one of the most entertaining films in a while, and a remarkably well-acted, even-handed, quality character study. I suppose I should have been prepared for a quality screenplay given the success of this Peter Morgan play in New York and London, but I was hardly expecting something this good. It's glib, funny, well-paced, expertly-structured, clever, observant, and intelligent. It creates a fascinating Nixon, played brilliantly by the great Frank Langella, though this is not quite up there with the likes of Oliver Stone's sadly under-appreciated ""Nixon"" or Robert Altman's endlessly fascinating ""Secret Honor"". The film is almost surprisingly well-directed, although there is a bit of the old TV trick of shaking the camera a bit, panning too often, to give the illusion of motion and energy when there's really just people in a room talking. The conversation's interesting enough, there's no need for that. Oh well, I suppose I am nitpicking.As far as Nixon movies go this is lightweight entertainment with plenty of comic moments largely leading up to two or three scenes of real human vulnerability. Aside from these scenes (which are truly, truly excellent), Peter Morgan conceives the meeting as something of a chess match with the unpredictability of a boxing match. To use J. Hoberman's words 'a prize fight between two comeback-hungry veterans, only one of whom could win'. On paper this could have been very heavy on amateur psychoanalysis and low on entertainment value but Morgan and I suppose Howard as well are clever enough to have some fun with the idea. This is not a criticism at all, the film has moments of surprisingly real depth and intellectualism, but overall the nature of the script works in its favor, makes those scenes more interesting, more ultimately rewarding.""Frost/Nixon"" is an entertaining, exciting film, around as populist as I expected but in a very different way. This is the sort of writing we don't see enough of, particularly not in today's films. It's vaguely reminiscent of a particularly good BBC television drama. The cast is certainly good enough for that. Langella and Michael Sheen are outstanding, both manage to accurately portray the real-life men they are portraying while still adding some characterization and mannerisms of their own. Langella's Tony-award winning performance might be up for Oscar consideration soon, but Sheen's Frost almost upstages him at times. No heavy-handedness, no political 'messages', just a fun, clever script and a great cast in a well-made film.",1
"Peter Morgan adapted his wonderful stage play Frost/Nixon for film with tremendous success. Directed by Ron Howard and starring Michael Sheen as David Frost and Frank Langella as Nixon, it tells the behind-the-scenes story of the famous series of interviews.For all many of us who lived through the Nixon presidency and Watergate, this is not the stuff of nostalgia or happy reminiscence. And when the Nixon tapes were published and his bigotry against just about everyone was revealed in explicit ""expletive deleted"" language, it was time to get disgusted all over again.Here, portrayed by Frank Langella, we see Nixon as a lonely, vulnerable, angry, and bitter human being, a man who's made a bed he must sleep in for the next twenty years. We also see a manipulative and highly intelligent individual who, despite a great deal of success, had no self-worth. It's the feeling of being an outsider, of never being good enough, that led him to some atrocious decisions.It's Langella's performance and Michael Sheen's wonderful performance as David Frost -- playboy, comedian, talk show host, and party-giver turned investigative journalist -- that anchor ""Frost/Nixon."" They are given great support by Kevin Bacon as Nixon's protective assistant, Jack Brennan, Sam Rockwell as James Reston, determined that Nixon pay for Watergate, as well as Oliver Platt, Matthew Mcfadyen, and Toby Jones.I found the determination of Frost as he attempted to raise financing for the interviews and get networks interested -- with no luck -- very admirable and inspiring. And his gut instinct paid off for him big time.I transcribed an interview with Nixon that took place in his home in the 1980s, as well as a speech he made during one of the Presidential election periods. He was a brilliant speaker, and as an interviewee, when the interview was over, he engaged the reporter in a very friendly personal conversation. In the end, both those listening experiences made me sad, as did this film. For everything he achieved, Richard Nixon had undeveloped gifts and potential. He robbed the world of a lot more than the ability to trust government. But in the end, as the film shows, he robbed himself the most.",1
"It didn't seem so in the run-up to the event, but British talk show host/interviewer David Frost's 1977 series of four on screen encounters with the disgraced ex-President Richard Nixon was great, historic television. This movie directed by Ron Howard successfully transfers the Peter Morgan play about the event to the big screen. Arguably, the story belonged here all along. The paraphernalia of a Hollywood production enables Howard to gussy up this claustrophobic event with such acoutrements as the luxury suite of a 747, Nixon's ""smart"" seaside villa La Casa Pacifica at San Clemente, and the impressive, downright menacing sight of a presidential motorcade. As the train of glittering, dark limos approach the Nixon friend's house where the interviews were shot it feels like a battalion of tanks; and Caroline Cushing (Rebecca Hall), the British socialite Frost chats up on the plane and makes his consort for the duration of the exploit seems the more slinky and glamorous for emerging from a posh airplane rather than a bare stage. Lighting tricks and artful camera angles help make Frank Langella morph more successfully into Nixon than his physicality would otherwise permit. Michael Sheen as Frost already seems to look and sound like his character, and the ""monkey suit"" blue blazer outfits add the final touch. His task is easier; we don't know so well or care so much what Frost was like. In the film version, both performances take on more nuance. Langella's performance on camera brims of with dyspeptic melancholy, aggression, and self-pity; Michael Sheen's as frost glitters with a muted, hysterical cheer mixing infantilism and fear. The extra visuals of a film also help to show Nixon's comfort and loneliness and Frost's sleazy playboy side.It's important that the fakery should work well, because the movie must provide lots of closeups that those in the balcony didn't see. So long as it works, the feeling of TV interviews is better achieved in the film, and the actors don't have to yell. The camera, sometimes annoyingly jerky, but in the best moments simply direct and relentless, does their yelling for them.So I'm saying this is a winner. Peter Morgan after all did the screenplay, and he's no stranger to such efforts--notable examples of his film writing are in The Last King of Scotland and The Queen; a rather less notable one is The Other Boleyn Girl. The flaws are simply in the events. For three of the interview parts, till it gets to Watergate in the fourth, Nixon seems to be winning. Despite a dramatic intervention by Nixon support staffer Col Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon) to prevent an abject breakdown, Nixon does buckle under in part four. But his admissions still remain in the realm of generality, and there is the question: does anything said on TV really matter? The audience for a West End or Broadway play is a bit different from the popcorn crowd and how appealing this film will be to the mainstream is uncertain. Needless to say it's all talk and minimal action. For students of contemporary American history nonetheless the topic is thrilling. Frost used his own money for down payments. In need of cash and highly mercenary, Nixon used the celebrity agent Swiftie Lazar (Toby Jones) to get $600,000 for the interviews. Frost lost sponsors and the US networks refused to come aboard. He made down payments from his own funds and borrowed. He hired two journalists, Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt) and James Reston (Sam Rockwell), to do support research. Reston was a firebrand opponent of Nixon. He refused to participate unless there was a commitment to shame Nixon and get him to admit he did wrong in Watergate and betrayed the country's trust.The issue was whether Frost had the depth to tackle a job like this. He wanted a Watergate confession too, but he let Nicon play him with small talk (despite the man's claim that he was no good at it) and temporize with lengthy self-serving reminiscences that blunted most of Frost's pointed questions. This is where Zelick and especially Reston come in to give a sense of urgency. Again the film excels where the play couldn't in showing Nixon's walk out to his car after each encounter, jubilant at first, pathetic at the end.Ultimately both in the play and the film, Frost's victory seems a hollow one, of little significance to morality or history. This is above all a story about television. In that arena, this was a coup. and there is great drama in how close Frost's project came to failing. As the encounters got under way, he was losing every sponsor, and later he lost his Australian show, having some time earlier lost his American one. The film tells us they all came back, and then some. Frost never really seems to have reentered the world of American television, but he has had many projects in England and is said now to be ""worth £20 million,"" with a live weekly current affairs program on Al Jazeera English. Nixon is dead, and though he may have won three rounds out of four in the Frost interviews, his legacy is tainted.The show belongs to Sheen and Langella, but Bacon is excellent as the stiff, loyal Col. Brennan, and Sam Rockwell strong in an unusually serious role for him. As Nixon's somewhat lost wife Pat, the child star of The Bad Seed Patty McCormack is touching. There are lots of other actors, far more than in the stage production, and the best thing is they don't get in the way. San Clemente also plays a significant role. The brightness and beauty of Nixon's ocean-side estate helps dramatize his depression by contrast. There were doubts about putting Howard in charge of the screen version, but they were groundless.",1
"Ron Howard's competent film adaptation of Peter Morgan's play (who also scripted and co-produced here) dramatizes the famous Frost/Nixon interviews from 1977. At one point in the film, Kevin Bacon's character explains to Frank Langella's Nixon that a portion of the interview will focus on ""Nixon the man"". To which Nixon retorted, ""As opposed to what? Nixon the horse?"" Of course what was on everyone's mind at the time was Watergate and how American was never able to give Nixon the trial they so desperately wanted. Through the unlikely Frost interviews, the American people finally heard the truth behind the scandal--straight from the horse's mouth.Morgan's source material translates smoothly onto film. Much as he did with ""The Queen"", he mixes a behind the scenes look at the immediate time period leading up to the historical event and closes with an almost word-for-word dramatization of said event. Also, like ""The Queen"", we have the excellent Michael Sheen on board, who after playing Tony Blair now takes on the mannerisms of the legendary British talk-show host and man-about-town David Frost. Director Ron Howard nicely interweaves archival news footage, faux-post interviews with the secondary players, and the dramatic reenactments of the actual Frost/Nixon interviews. Howard's studied but pedestrian style of direction lends itself well to this type of docudrama as he allows the actual events to speak for themselves and the fine performances to shine on their own. Though it takes quite awhile to get where it's going, the final interview where Frost takes Nixon head-on about the Watergate cover-up is a payoff well worth the wait.Of course the most fascinating aspect of the film is Frank Langella's portrayal of a shamed and swollen Richard Nixon. He plays him as a fallen man desperate for an act of contrition but still in too deep with his old trickery and slick ways. His performance, and the way it connects with the audience, is wonderfully layered. On one level, we have an aged actor thought to be well past his prime firing back on all cylinders in a renaissance role that will likely lead to a showering of award nominations. The way the film reduces his performance to that one lingering close-up after being steamrolled by Frost on the last day of the interview leaves a lasting impression. But it also works on another level as it is meant to represent the reduction of Nixon's political life to that one lingering close-up on the television monitor when he realized it's all over for him. The audience members who remember watching the interviews and can picture the actual close-up they saw on their TV screens are now allowed to share a communion with the audience members who weren't even born yet and now only have a memory of Langella's face on the silver screen. In that sense, Langella truly became Nixon, and his performance will not soon be forgotten.",1
"The sole reason I did not watch this in the cinema two years ago was that I could not find a theater near me that played it, and I was, as I am now, a busy student. That caused me to have to take breaks in my viewing of it, and I have to say, it was not easy to do so. It is, simply put, immensely gripping, and the ending is pitch perfect. I haven't seen the play, but I understand that this expands upon the people around the two who were engaged in the verbal boxing match, especially Cushing. The two leads are the same, and I can get behind getting them to do both versions. They are immensely talented(they had the material so committed to memory that they only flubbed once each), and Sheen is an absolute chameleon, disappearing entirely into what he portrays(I can just barely believe that he played Lucian in the Underworld trilogy... great job in those, by the way). The cast is fantastic, and everyone really delves into their credible and swiftly developed characters. This manages to not paint anyone as a one-note good or bad guy, and I have to admit, I did not feel any sympathy for the former president before this film. The acting is amazing. Dialog is excellent. A little of it was improvised; so was most of the camera-work, and it helps make it feel dynamic and natural. This builds tension rather well. The drama is compelling. There is a short sequence of disturbing content, infrequent strong language and brief nudity in this. The DVD comes with an informational commentary track by Howard, a well-done 23 minute behind-the-scenes production, 22 and a half minutes of deleted scenes, and two well-made featurettes of 7 and a half minutes(about the real interview) and six minutes(about the Nixon library), respectively. I recommend this to anyone interested in the subject. 8/10",1
"What I am about to say may sound a little mean. However, until recently I never took Frank Langella all that seriously as an actor. With film credits like ""And God Created Woman"" (1988), ""Masters of the Universe"" and ""The 12 Chairs"", I hadn't seen very much from him that was outstanding in any way. However, here in ""Frost/Nixon"" he demonstrates that my preconceptions was definitely wrong--he is a darn fine actor. His performance as Nixon was wonderful--especially when it COULD have come off as a parody--like Rich Little doing a Nixon impersonation. But, he was able to capture the man very well--and, provide a bit of insight into a very enigmatic man.As for Michael Sheen, who co-starred and played David Frost, he was excellent as well--but he did not dominate the movie like Langella and really couldn't due to his character. Making Frost any different would have been unrealistic and the viewer is naturally drawn more to the Nixon character--even if they dislike him.As for the movie, it's a film that is probably going to appeal to you more if you know a lot about the Watergate affair. This means that younger folks who didn't live through and remember the 1970s will get less out of it unless they know their history well. As for me, I'm a retired history teacher, so even if I was only a kid when Nixon resigned, I understand what had occurred and the figures involved. So, when names of the various people involved are mentioned or what exactly Nixon's involvement was in the cover-up are discussed, it would sure help to know the basics. If you are fuzzy on this, reading through Wikipedia or another website wouldn't hurt.Looking at the film's box office receipts, I could assume that because Watergate is a rather distant memory is why the film made so little money. After all, the acting and writing certainly were not at issue--they were top-notch. And, I must also admit, the film was quite cerebral and there aren't a lot of things to appeal to teens or someone who likes explosions or raunchy comedies (you do get to see a gratuitous butt near the end, but this isn't enough to appeal to this crowd). An amazingly good film.",1
"A remarkable performance by Frank Langella as Richard Nixon transforms this unexpected Ron Howard film into a gripping and unforgettable experience. The behind the scenes of the famous David Frost, Richard Nixon interviews pale in comparison to the compelling sight of Nixon/Langella thinking. It was difficult to forget that Michael Sheen was not Tony Blair but David Frost. Sheen's Frost is an entertaining foil to Langella's somber,sad, desolate portrait of the former president. Ron Howard finds a winning pace giving the true tale a fictional slant. Unfortunately I never saw the stage production and the film never betrays its theatrical origins. In a bizarre sort of way this is Ron Howard's most cinematic film. I highly recommend it.",1
"Frost/Nixon is one of the best film of the year, and certainly a strong contender for best picture. Langella's marvelous performance as the bedazzled Richard Nixon and Michael Sheen's terrific portrayal of the rigorous David Frost combined with Ron Howard's magnificent direction make the movie a memorable one. Not only that but the supporting cast- including Sam Rockwell, Kevin Bacon, Matthew MacFayden and Olvier Platt- was also phenomenal. Frost/Nixon is an epic, an epic that involves not guns and human sacrifices but words and tense emotions. It's also a historically significant film, for all who crave to know what really happened and whether or not Nixon didn't ""obstruct any laws."" In short Frost/Nixon is an amazing film filled with sharp dialogues, amazing performances and tense and provocative sentiments as well as an explosive yet subtle ending.10/10 Go see it!",1
"There's a brief but memorable moment in ""Frost/Nixon"" where one of Nixon's most ardent haters, a researcher played by Sam Rockwell, is about to confront for the first time the man he holds responsible for the destruction of American ideals. This is his time to shine and honor his opinions by not shaking the 'Shakers' hand. Yet, despite a brief hesitation, he gives both hand and respect. That says it all, there's the politician, there's the man, and one of the greatest tricks a corrupt one ever pulls is to hide behind the mask of friendliness.No one can resist it, much less a TV audience. In my student's essay about the power of media -which is the film's essential theme- I wrote that the camera not only changes perceptions but actions too. As long as there is an instance of mediation between two people, something will cease to be natural, and the talent of those who control the media is to make it imperceptible. So, when Frost (Michael Sheen) decides to interview Nixon, with his own money because no American channel will accept to pay a British interviewer, he gives the fallen President a golden opportunity to talk to American people. Nixon (Frank Langella) advised by Swifty Lazar (Toby Jones) accepts the challenge, a TV show will reach the people quicker and simpler than a memoirs book.It all comes to this : either Nixon shows a new shining image three years after the Watergate and his disastrous resignation, the only one in History, or Frost confronts a man to his responsibilities and forces him to admit his guilt. That's what Frost's partner John Birt (Matthew McFayden), Bob Zelnick, a TV journalist (Oliver Platt) and James Reston, Jr. (Rockwell) expect from the interview, anything but making Nixon sympathetic. With these opposite challenges, the premises could be that of a boxing match. And ""Frost/Nixon"" is indeed a duel (the slash is relevant) with no holds barred between huge and flawed egos, starting with Frost, a cocky womanizer trying to forget that he was basically exiled in Australia to host forgettable entertainment shows, the refusals from TV studios to sponsor his project will finish to teach him lessons of humility.But Nixon plays in another league, being the epitome of 'unpopular culture', a tragic figure who destroyed what were left of American dreams, including his own. In 1995, Oliver Stone offered a remarkable view on Nixon, with no concession. Still, we couldn't help but feeling sympathy for a man entrapped by both his ideals and demons. The movie was remarkably served by Anthony Hopkins' performance but now, I wonder if it doesn't have something to do with the personality of Nixon himself, ambivalent to the best, with this mix of fascination and repulsion only great men achieve to inspire. Maybe he was the last 'larger-than-life' President. Anyway, he's not an amateur and during the interview, he's like Goliath ready to frost David.Goliath Nixon also has a redoubtable right-hand man (Kevin Bacon) who works as an adviser and he knows himself the traps of TV, he whose sweating under the upper lip cost him the Presidential campaign in 1960, so he wouldn't make the same mistakes. David Frost IS the rookie and when the first interview (we might as well call it a round) starts, Frost bluntly opens with the Watergate ""why didn't you burn the files?"" Nixon is startled first but uses the question to pose as a victim of a system supported by his predecessors. Trying an uppercut, Frost was literally knocked down, tasting the toughness of an opponent who meant business. And as viewers, we're satisfied to see Frost put in his place for a moment, before he could recover.The measure of the thrills provided by the interviews is because both have everything to win, yet so much to lose. Nixon is in a dead-end and any attempt to gain his popularity back is welcome, and by throwing himself in that crazy project, Frost lost his show, 600 000 dollars and jeopardized his career, maybe more and I'm not sure his newly conquered girlfriend, Caroline Cushing (Rebecca Hall) would've stayed longer with him. In her one shining moment that doesn't rely on her distractingly beautiful looks, she notices that Frost doesn't like being questioned. And that weakness shows with Nixon's offensive remarks before the interview, destabilizing him on his effeminate shoes or his 'masculine attitude' with Caroline. No holds barred indeed, the two men bet a lot in this interview, and it's like two destinies crossing one another.The remarkable thing about Ron Howard's movie is that we all know it ended with a heartfelt confession from Nixon, one of the most memorable and defining TV moments of the 70's. But it's all in the process, on how Frost will finally take the edge over Nixon and find the vulnerable spots, or use his adversary's weapons against him, not through cynicism or aggressiveness but the true belief that his project is fair and for once, the variety show producer must act like a journalist. A man who failed as journalist must not interview the one who failed as a President. And this is why they were so close, yet so different from each other.It is between the two men and the others are only spectators, filling the film with many interesting comments about the evolution of the match, and what lessons they learned from the confrontation. A man should feel important enough to believe in his rightness but never such as he can escape from his responsibilities. The lessons served both men, and the ending is twice happy as each one seemed to have triumphed over his demons. Sometimes, truth hurts, but how relieving it can also be!",1
"I had the pleasure of watching this gripping movie at the opening night of the British Film festival. Ron Howard's direction and story telling ability are in top form with this effort. From the very first scene a carefully crafted and very credible 70s's atmosphere sets a solid stage for the superbly cast film and quickly transports the viewer into the political jungle that was ""Tricky Dickey's"" playground.The acting duo of Frank Langella & Micheal Sheen (Nixon & Frost) are set on a collision course that finds two deeply passionate personalities at the mercy of their insatiable desires. Both actor's portrayals are a study of affectation and body language, pleasurably accurate and yet not simply an impersonation. Indeed, the film never strays from the distinct Howard format that breathes so much life (read intimacy) into this familiar and yet mysterious relationship that exists for so many people who lived through the exceptional event.Make no mistake, this is by no means a two man show, quite the contrary. In fact, the wealth of supporting roles is perhaps the finest feature of this production. Bacon's devoted and stalwart marine practically glints of gun metal and polished shoe leather. The trio of Gould, Platt and Rockwell portray effortlessly the roles of the men who, brick by brick, constructed the platform from which Frost so successfully and serendipitously elicited one of the greatest unspoken confessions of all time. Rebecca Hall is delicious and demure, constantly filling scenes with her elegant presence.Perhaps the richest praise should be reserved for Peter Morgan, who has, without question, penned a truly captivating and insightful story that delivers not only a satisfying comprehension of a complex time in US history, but captures a generation's struggle to come to terms with the frailty of leadership that still echoes today.Not to be missed, this film can be enjoyed on multiple levels and will undoubtedly be regarded as seminal for it's engrossing insight and expert depiction.",1
"I almost skipped ""Frost/Nixon,"" and I am glad I didn't. It's eminently worthwhile, one of the year's few films that deserves to be seen.My reluctance had to do with the expectation that it will offer nothing new to somebody who lived through the Watergate years and saw the Frost interviews (although remembering surprisingly little of them).Ron Howard's film is anything but ho-hum - if anything it's a bit too gussied up to be exciting. There is an element of discernible manipulation of the audience, but mostly it works, and you don't long resist it.The (relatively) unsung hero of the film besides Howard, Frank Langella's tremendous Nixon, and Michael Sheen's excellent Frost is the screenwriter: once again Peter Morgan (of ""The Last King of Scotland"" and ""The Queen"") engages mind and heart, and doesn't let go. Sam Rockwell's James Reston, Jr. and Oliver Platt's Bob Zelnick (Frost's two collaborators) are outstanding, and Kevin Bacon's Nixon-worshipping Jack Brennan is the actor's best work in a long time.Morgan and Howard manage to make the viewer think constantly of another criminal President without saying or showing anything overt - they just let history, past and present, speak.I had a strange, uncomfortable thought watching ""Frost/Nixon"": even if some future film ""humanizes"" (not excuses) Bush the way Nixon comes through this one, W. would still remain a malevolent midget against Nixon's accomplishments and actual *brain*. How far we have fallen.",1
"It is a testament to Peter Morgan's humility and skill as a writer and Ron Howard's ability to take a based on real events story to which the outcome is widely known and create a compelling ""what will happen"" drama (as he did with Apollo 13) that Frost/Nixon succeeds as a film.This is a film based on a play that neither felt trapped in staginess nor weakly expanded with just the stage dialogue delivered exactly but in a variety of outdoor locales. I have to give Peter Morgan a lot of credit here. I saw the play in London and wondered throughout production of the film how they would escape its theatricality. Many recent films from plays like Proof, Closer, The Producers, have failed to throw off the shackles of stage feel. Not that all bad films, many served as a good way to see the play if you hadn't had the chance, but they weren't necessarily compelling films in their own right. What is so impressive about Morgan's work here is that in adapting his own play he has not been precious, he has not tried to enforce his already successful stage-play onto a film director  he has wholly reworked it from beginning to end and yet retained all the gravity and drama that the play elicited. If you saw the play everything key is here and yet you can feel the difference  the pacing is changed, the power achieved in different ways.For this Howard also deserves credit. To have filmed the play as it was would have been disastrous on film  one long two-hander scene after another, duelling narrators. And given the reverence the play has enjoyed a less experienced director could have fallen into this trap or that of simply changing the settings, but Howard knows when we need quick cuts, when a long drawn out piece that worked on stage needs to be reduced to a couple of lines and a post-scene reaction, and when he needs to hold with a scene and let it play between the two leads. This happens in several impressive moments in the latter half of the film.For some this might constitute the films biggest flaw however. Morgan and Howard can't escape the fact that in the final stages of the film it is the head-to-head scenes of Frost and Nixon that are key and they must stay with them more. This is necessary, but it sadly means that the supporting players, so well established and broadened out to expand the scope in the first half, fall be the wayside. A superb Toby Jones as Irving 'Swifty' Lazar, Matthew Macfadyen as John Birt and always reliable Oliver Platt as Bob Zelnick all but disappear and only Kevin Bacon and Sam Rockwell play any significant role beyond the two leads in the final stages. This is a shame. It may best serve the story creating the sense of claustrophobia necessary to keep you gripped but it does feel like a film of two halves because of it and it noticeable.Frank Langella and Michael Sheen are superb, as they were on stage, and Langella will take a lot of beating for the Oscar this year. There are many moments here when I was so involved I forgot I wasn't watching the real Nixon. It's not that he looks that like Nixon but he is so real you believe it completely and have to remind yourself you're watching an actor.Platt is reliably Platt. Bacon is also his typically understated solid presence doing a lot with little. Toby Jones is fantastic in a small role  instantly memorable; and Rebecca Hall builds on a series of strong performances. But in the supporting cast it is Rockwell that stands out. Sure, he has the most to do but he is completely in this role, he manages to sink into the role which is something he rarely does. He matches the skill he showed in Lawn Dogs and Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind here and it is great to see him back at his best.I thoroughly recommend this film.",1
"Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) is the disgraced president after just resigning. David Frost (Michael Sheen) has the idea immediately to get his interview. He is certain that it will be a ratings bonanza. After years of hounding, Nixon does the interview in summer 1977 to set the record straight and collect the $600k.Director Ron Howard has created a fascinating movie about what on the surface should be a very static drama. He injects great energy and excitement for what could have been a very dry movie. Michael Sheen does a great job as the charming TV personality. Frank Langella doesn't have the look of Nixon, but his terrific acting chops is put to full use to infused his character with Nixon's persona. Howard allows the two great actors to shine without putting to much gloss to distract the audience.",1
"From Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Ron Howard (The Paper, Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind), I knew that this film would be focusing on the time of the biggest political and financial possibly in the whole of American history, and I was up for seeing a reconstruction of one the major events in the aftermath. Basically, based on the stage play, set in 1970's, the Watergate scandal breaks in in 1972 and President of the United States, Richard Nixon (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Frank Langella), may have been directly involved, and in 1974 he resigned from office without admitting any guilt and without any apology to the nation. A few weeks later British talk show host (Sir) David Frost (Michael Sheen) is in discussion with the heads at LWT (London Weekend Television) with high interest in interviewing the former President, but they do not believe many people will watch and that he would be willing to talk to anyone, but Frost persuades them, telling them that the live resignation speech was watched by 400 million. After Nixon has recovered from phlebitis in hospital, a deal is made after securing the figure of $600,000 (originally $500,000) for a series of interviews, paying an advance, but Nixon's post-presidential chief of staff Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon) doubts he can pay the entire sum, and Frost is being turned by all U.S. broadcast networks because of his lightweight approach during interviews. Deciding to finance the project privately he prepares his research and questions with his friend and producer John Birt (Matthew Macfadyen), and investigators James Reston Jr. (Sam Rockwell) and Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt), he also turns down the offer of lead involving a Federal Courthouse in Washington. Frost does get to meet Nixon before the interviews process will begin, and he is warned about his approach by the former President's people, but even these things don't make him fully realise the antagonistic nature the talks could bring between the two men, and certainly he cannot comprehend how important they could be in the careers of them both. The first three sessions of recording, each lasting two and a half hours, Nixon is allowed to talk and talk almost uninterrupted and answers rather vague and unimportant questions that tread carefully, these long monologues he gives, such as swift brush through of Vietnam and his achievements in foreign policy stop Frost from challenging him with the pressing questions, so his editorial team express their frustrations and doubt his ability as an interviewer. The final session is the one that will focus on the Watergate scandal, and four days before Frost gets a phone call in his hotel room from an inebriated Nixon, and mistaking him for his new partner Caroline Cushing (Rebecca Hall) he answered the phone with a mention of a cheeseburger, this gets their conversation flowing, but of course Nixon gets serious in saying that the final talk will make or break both of them, he sees it as some kind of psychological battle, where if he wins he will revive his political career, he is sure he will be the victor. Following the phone call Frost goes into action researching all night through to the morning, and having sold the interviews to interested networks and gaining advertising sponsors he accepts the offer from Reston about the lead he has, the next three days he spends preparing, and he is ready for the final recorded conversation with the information he has gathered, including about Charles Colson involved in the scandal. The editors are gripped by Frost's more confident and badgering technique to take on Nixon, even causing him to say the shocking words ""When the President does it, that means it's not illegal"", essentially concluding he covered up his wrongdoing, and when asked to confirm this Brennan bursts in to stop the recording and take the President out to stop he can incriminate himself more. Nixon thanks Brennan for his concern, but he wants to continue, and when recording resumes Nixon admits participating in a cover-up and in an emotional moment opens up and says that ""he let the American people down"" and that he regrets it deeply, this was the point of the interview that became momentous, he is congratulated by his crew for creating a must see piece of television. Before returning to England, Frost and Nixon meet at his villa, where the interviewer presents the former President with a pair of shoes, Nixon graciously accepts defeat from the psychological battle, and Frost confirms his question about calling him at his hotel and that they talked about cheeseburgers, the final text tells that the word ""gate"" has become common in reported scandals, Frost continues to interview, and that Nixon wrote his memoirs, but never escaped controversy, so stayed out of the limelight until he died. Also starring Toby Jones as Irving 'Swifty' Lazar, Clint Howard (Ron's brother) as Lloyd Davis, Patty McCormack as Pat Nixon and Rance Howard (Ron's father) as Ollie. Both Langhella and Sheen give marvellously strong performances as they try to outwit each other psychologically using the power of their words to get and out of each other's heads, the script really relies on strong words, some obviously based on the real interviews, so it feels just as compelling as the real thing, and the story is played out well, even if you don't know much about politics this is a worthwhile watch, a terrific historical drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film, Best Editing, Best Make Up & Hair and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Original Score for Hans Zimmer and Best Screenplay. Very good!",1
"Nixon might had lied countless times but this film doesn't, except for some artistic license or other that is necessary to make the story more spicy or to fill a drama and tension that might have never existed during the famous Frost/Nixon interview. Ron Howard directs ""Frost/Nixon"" a thrilling story with the behind the scenes of one of the most famous broadcasts ever presented in television, and that is the meeting between Former President Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) and English TV host David Frost (Michael Sheen) after the President's impeachment. This meeting will be just like a long awaited boxing match between two heavyweights and it will take all of their power, intelligence and courage to make of this event something memorable and it will be memorable. Behind these two fearless men there's a great team assisting, played by Kevin Bacon, Sam Rockwell, Matthew McFayden, Rebecca Hall, Oliver Platt and Toby Jones.Transforming a play of success into a film is a very difficult job but writer Peter Morgan adapted it perfectly, with wonderful dialogs exchange between Sheen and Langella and all the actors, balancing drama, comedy, heated discussions, and of course, using quotes of the real interview, one of the most successful events ever presented on TV, very historical. Allied with a magnificent screenplay there's a highest quality of the performances. Langella might sound and look like a Nixon caricature but he manages to portray the President in his emotional and darker sides, a figure that needs to be doing something useful other than just be a retired politician, always in the arena even if that arena is a TV show where he might get trapped with his demons, face to face with the American public. Sheen makes of his Frost a entertaining man who gives a leap into a whole new field (a serious interview with a former president) where he needs to find a way to survive or win what could be the battle for his career, his reputation, but more than that he wants to be a star in America making the interview of the Century. Two men without their masks in front of a whole audience trying to win a battle where the winners are us the viewers delighted with such incredible moments. The supporting cast is top-notch and is amazing to see all of them together in such a brilliant project.Explosive in its content, thrilling in its presentations without losing the rhythm and the movement, ""Frost/Nixon"" comes as one of the most absorbing films ever made. It was everything I expected and more! Brilliant! 10/10",1
"Frank Langella's performance as Nixon is truly moving in this remarkable film by Ron Howard, which gripped me for its entirety. As someone who grew up during the Watergate hearings, and who reviled Nixon as the embodiment not just of corruption but of the worst kind of interventionist, even genocidal, American politics, this film gives substance to a man who, in later years (especially the GW Bush years, which make Nixon look like a political and intellectual colossus), achieved something of a place in history beyond the scandal of Watergate.But what Frost/Nixon - and in particular Langella - does is give humanity to the man. We see his arrogance, his love of power, his need to win (hinted at wonderfully in a moment when he is jogging in his San Clemente home to rousing music), but we also see his inner conflicts, his regrets, the fact that perhaps more than simply his crimes regarding Watergate haunted him - that the impact of his decisions on South East Asia were not entirely remote from him, either. And in a sequence that I will not reveal, to avoid spoiling the plot, we also see a hint of his madness, for it is that, I think, rather than senility. (You have to see it to understand this.)Ron Howard and playwright/screenwriter Peter Morgan have achieved a remarkable feat in adapting the stage play, which sadly I did not see. Not for a moment does this feel stage bound; instead it is a compelling human portrait of two men - for Frost is fascinating, too, and Michael Sheen captures both his much criticized (at the time) surface gloss and also his deeper fears - but above all of the impact that each of our decisions, large and small, and not least if you are leader of the ""Free World,"" have on us all.",1
"Richard Nixon, one of the most controversial men of political history, loved by few, hated by many. This is the movie that finally depicted Nixon not just a man who screwed up the country or cheated his way and abused his power, we see him as a human being. We also see David Frost who despite just wanted a boost in his career went in with courage to take on Richard Nixon and didn't expect to get into the fight of the century. Ron Howard added the perfect charisma that this movie needed and had the perfect cast to make the story unbiased. Frank Langella, I love this man, ever since I was a little girl and saw him as Dracula, I was so enchanted with him. He's a terrific actor that was just due to get an Oscar nomination and this is the role that won him that honor of being noticed. Frost/Nixon is the actor's movie that deserved much more attention from audiences who truly need a lesson in American history.A series of news reports documents Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal, prior to his resignation speech. Meanwhile, David Frost has finished recording an episode of his talk show and watches on television as Nixon leaves the White House. A few weeks later Frost discusses with his producer and friend, John Birt, the possibility of an interview. When Frost mentions Nixon as the subject, Birt doubts the likelihood that Nixon would be willing to talk to Frost. Nixon discusses his memoirs with literary agent Irving Lazar, who tells the former president of a request by Frost to conduct an interview with an offer of $600,000. Lazar contacts Frost to inform him that Nixon is interested, so Frost and Birt fly to California to meet with Nixon. Frost hires two investigators, Bob Zelnick and James Reston Jr. to dig for information along with Birt, mainly on the Watergate scandal and the interviews begin, making Frost realize that they don't call Nixon ""Tricky Dick"" for nothing in the ultimate battle interview of the decade.Frost/Nixon is one of the finest movies that came out of 2008, we had a lot of terrific movies that year, that's why I feel that this movie was somewhat over shadowed. But I have a feeling that this movie will be considered an American classic down the line. Frank and Michael had great chemistry and you could cut the tension in that interview with a gardening sheerer, it was so thick. Ron Howard did a terrific job on the style of the movie, it really captured the feel of the 1970's and the time where America's number one enemy was a man they had elected themselves to run the country. I do highly recommend this movie, especially over a film like Nixon, while that was a good movie, it was over done and Frank raised the bar on performances when it comes to portraying Richard Nixon, he had him down and I felt like I was staring right at Tricky Dick. This is a fantastic movie, I recommend you watch it if you get the chance.10/10",1
"Frost/Nixon was indeed a good movie but the question is ""will it stand the test of time?"". I seriously doubt it. The performances are admirable and the writing is very good but I was not overly impressed compared to other movies I have seen.The acting was good throughout the cast. Frank Langella was good but not spectacular as Richard Nixon. In my mind I will have Anthony Hopkins as Nixon not Langella. In Nixon strange emotions were brought up towards the man himself, in here Nixon seems to be quite a very good man. This I had a problem with, I liked the approach of him not being shown as an evil man but I did not like the fact he appeared to better than he was. I felt that Michael Sheen stole the show from Langella and in fact played better than him. His performance was more diverse and versatile and of course the movie is about him interviewing Nixon not Nixon interviewing Frost.The directing was solid as usual of Ron Howard. Yet with the character of Nixon he seemed to be pushing the idea of sympathy upon us for Richard Nixon. When it comes to feeling emotions such as sympathy, it should not be pushed upon you. Many scenes though were quite intense but this movie was carried by the writing of Peter Morgan. The nice quick dialog between the characters is what really set the tone of the film above all.I liked Frost/Nixon but it is not a powerful movie. It sets a good tone at the beginning and stays with it throughout. Like other Ron Howard movies it doesn't take a giant leap of greatness. It does have moments of greatness and a few memorable scenes but not enough to really stand the test of time. I do not believe it deserves its best picture, best director or best actor nominations as other men and movies have had more powerful and affecting influence this year.",1
"When you take on the role of someone so identifiable in the public mind as Richard M. Nixon you'd better have the acting chops for the job. Nixon is so easy to caricature whether gently or acidly. After the Watergate scandal broke, the caricatures became more and more acid indeed. That was the challenge that Frank Langella met and overcame. In his performance he never once slipped into a David Frye like imitation, though honestly I kept expecting him to throughout the film as I watched it. He was Nixon right down to the dark recesses of his troubled soul. A terribly private man who chose the most public of all professions to engage in. A man of poor background who could not forget the snubs of adolescence. A brilliant man capable of initiatives in governance like the opening of Communist China. A cynical man because he advocated policies that kept China closed for years to America. The other half of Frost/Nixon is the charming British talk show host David Frost who bet his whole career on getting an interview with one of the most despised figures in the world and getting him to open up on television. In retrospect it was obvious that Frost was the guy for the job. Someone in the hard news field like Mike Wallace would never have gotten in the door to see Nixon.Unlike Nixon, David Frost is still with us and apparently voiced no complaints about Michael Sheen, not of the Sheen/Estevez acting clan of the USA, playing him. Sheen also responds with a good characterization and captures David Frost as I remember him from the Seventies and Eighties.Frost/Nixon ran for 137 performances last year on Broadway and director Ron Howard had the good sense to cast Langella and Sheen in the roles they originated there. Langella got a Tony Award and will probably get an Oscar nomination.Best scene in the film is an inebriated Richard Nixon calling David Frost one night and revealing one nasty side to Frost. Sheen's facial expressions as Langella raves on the phone tell everything.Kevin Bacon is in the cast as Nixon's chief aide in retirement Jack Brennan. There's a bit of Oliver North in Bacon's portrayal, the loyal former Marine who can't forget who was his commander-in-chief during Vietnam and appreciates him if no others do. Brennan also can't forget he felt a stranger in his own country with people despising him for his service. In the recent election, surviving Nixon people supported former POW John McCain against Republican rivals for the nomination. In my state of New York, McCain's campaign was headed by Nixon's son-in-law Edward Cox. Bacon's loyal Brennan is ironic also because it was Nixon's aides, aides mostly acquired in his eight years between his defeat by John F. Kennedy in 1960 and his election in 1968 that were the ones that did Nixon in. I've often wondered if Nixon had been elected in 1960 would we have seen a Watergate because all the names associated with that scandal were people who would have never been in a Nixon presidency then.Frost/Nixon is a fascinating look at a tortured soul who wound up in the most powerful position in the world. There may be some Academy gold for this film and you can also believe that Nixon will continue to fascinate people for years.",1
"I am always happy to be proved wrong when I am negative. I did not believe it possible that Ron Howard could make a film that is remotely watchable, especially since he figuratively married Brian Grazer. The two together have such an insipid work view that even with potentially weighty material what they give us seems to be from a world made up on a schoolbus.But this is very effective at what it attempts. Its a very simple dynamic, but it has significant resonance for someone my age. He manages to hold the tension all the way to the end, and that's no simple task. I think that the way he has done this is to put himself into the Frost character: a thin intellect struggling publicly with difficult ideas and complex situations. I can easily imagine that the struggles he had with trying to guide Langella into complexities.Fortunately, Langella has already done this part  without the hulking posture  in the superior ""Starting Out in the Evening."" Even more luckily, the Watergate situation is one of the best stories in politics, newly reborn as the US struggles with how to handle the crimes of its 43rd president.And more luck: the situation is inherently cinematic because its a story about a similar goal: how to reveal a complex truth for the camera. So generally, Howard is able to keep himself focused. But there is one element where Howard/Grazer just cannot help themselves. They have to add a pretty girl who appears only for this story (she is met on the plane on his introductory trip). She them provides the domestic support that seems to be at the foundation of every Howard story. She is pretty. I last saw her in a story about a college quiz, where she was ""the appealing one."" But here she is a distraction that doesn't fit, a long answer to a simple question. Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",1
"Throughout the history of the Presidency, there is but one man who was dishonorably forced to resign his job; Richard M. Nixon. Although no deal was suppose to have been made between Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, the first act President Ford carried out was to pardon his predecessor for a crime, he insisted he did not commit. In this film called "" David Frost Interviews Richard Nixon "" English Talk-show Host, David Frost, seizes a great opportunity to boost his ratings and secure several new TV shows, by arranging to interview the former Man in the White House. David Frost (Michael Sheen) plays Himself and is less convincing than his flaunted screen image. For this movie, Richard Nixon is played by exceptional actor Frank Langella, who does a remarkable job of playing the self-centered, egotistical and politically conniving ex-Congressman from California. The interview itself is fraught with planned attacks and defenses on both sides, each seeking to score points with the T.V. audiences watching across the country. Frost and Nixon hope their real motives for the Interview displays more style, than substance. Yet, after watching the entire movie, one believes there could have been more secured than ethereal coronets and self pity. The highlight of the film leans towards Langella when emotion, not confrontation becomes the final victory. This is one movie which should be seen by History and Political Science students in every school dealing with Watergate and Presidential authority. ****",1
"If I was a voting member of the academy, I would vote for Frank Langella as Best Actor for his performance as the disgraced president Richard Nixon. I also think Michael Sheen OBE should have been nominated as well but he would easily won in the supporting actor category playing Sir David Frost OBE. Both Frost and his producer, John Birt, were knighted by the Queen. I didn't like the Reston character very much and I have read one of his books on Rev. Jim Jones. Langella and Sheen performed the same roles on Broadway and the West End in London. They did a brilliant job and were both equally brilliant in their roles. I never thought that I would have sympathies for the former disgraced president but I did. I felt Langella brought the role of Nixon from a caricature into a full-fledged multi-dimensional human being. Of course, the President is a human being although they were elected to the highest office in the country. This film is one of the best that I have seen but I would have liked to have seen Nixon's interaction with underused Patty McCormack who plays his devoted and dedicated wife, Patricia.",1
"Movies centered on politics are often interesting on an intellectual level, but never has a film of such an ilk been so thoroughly entertaining. Director Ron Howard's adaptation of the stage play of the same name, manages to both stay loyal to the true events that served as inspiration, yet infuses it with life and achieves the utmost level of satisfaction without compromising the rich and weighty subject matter. Infused with sensational performances throughout, Howard has delivered what I think is his best film yet.Beginning with President Richard Nixon's (Frank Langella reprising his role from the play) resignation following the Watergate scandal, the movie jumps to a few years later where the ex-president has been demoted to giving talks at luncheons, and interviews for money. Meanwhile down under in Australia, a wildly popular talk show host named David Frost (Michael Sheen) comes up with the ultimate publicity stunt; winch out the confession the American people never got from their former president. Nixon has other plans however, seeing only easy money for answering some fluff questions over a four day period. Frost assembles a team of researchers and experts including Sam Rockwell as James Reston Jr., Mathew McFayden as John Burt and Oliver Platt as Bob Zelnick to ensure his suave defeat of his opponent and secure their place in infamy.Frost/Nixon succeeds in overcoming a number of hurdles. It flourishes, even if you have no knowledge of the events of Watergate, or have no interest in American politics, but will thrill those who do. From what I understand, certain liberties were taken with the facts surrounding the endlessly notorious interviews, but more often then not, Frost/Nixon is less of a political film, then it is a sword and shield bout to the death; an intense duel between these two intellectuals, and how their confidence and overconfidence sways the interviews in both their favours before the gripping final outcomeFrank Langella is sure to get an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the infamous president, but Michael Sheen should by no means be overlooked. He is equally solid, and to some extent has the more difficult role; in keeping his own against the veteran stage actors larger then life embodiment of the president. We also get fantastic supporting work from Kevin Bacon as Nixon's aid who's two-fold admiration and quiet pity and embarrassment is tragic and very affecting. From a visual standpoint, Howard's film is glossy and superbly shot without feeling to large in its scope. It is intimate and immediate with a keen sense of the times. Perhaps the biggest achievement of the movie is the handling of the Nixon character. Howard manages to capture both his corruptness and smug pompousness while showing him as a true human; with some sympathy but mostly just not as a faceless monster and without a blunt bias. So don't be turned away simply because of the films 'political' backbone, because Frost/Nixon is some of the most simultaneously intelligent and entertaining film-making of the decade. 9.5 / 10.0 Read all my reviews at : http://simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",1
"The relevance of this film today may be sadly overlooked. As the current President of the United States (George W. Bush) ends his tenure with his country disillusioned, in debt, at war, and in disarray, one cannot help but compare him to the late Richard Nixon. Strangely, the older politician, now dead and buried for over a decade, seems much more the intellectual statesman. Nixon has always seemed the darker man, the loner in the Oval Office, as compared to Bush, the happy-go-lucky Texan. While the former suffered from the same malady of self-importance, at least he would ponder positive foreign affairs decisions before creating his political enemy's list. The latter would rather snap celebrity photos with endearing fans than answer tough questions about foreign policy. Leave that to Cheney. Both Nixon and Bush seemed to suffer from the same kind of self-aggrandizement that put the country and the world at tremendous risk. One lost the presidency for his flaws, the other lost nothing personally, except the well-being and respect of his nation.Frost/Nixon, filmed in semi-documentary style by Ron Howard, is about the elder statesman Nixon revealing himself and his enigmatic heart of hearts to his country and the world via a relatively lightweight British interviewer, David Frost. Overnight, Frost has to remake himself from a chatty interviewer like Jay Leno into a tough interrogator like Mike Wallace. Both men have a lot at stake. According to the film, Frost's career has stagnated and he desperately needs a large breakthrough in media to be taken seriously. And he has shoved most of his personal capital into the project. Nixon was never tried for Watergate and therefore never had a platform from which his case was heard. The Frost interviews becomes Nixon's witness stand, and the television his courtroom.The acting in this film is some of the finest of all the Oscar contenders of 2008, probably because Sheen and Langella re-prised their roles from the Broadway and London stage-play of the same name. For well over 30 years, Frank Langella has been quietly forging an acting career that has had sparse recognition for the quality of his work. In short, he is one of the most overlooked and under-appreciated talents in Hollywood films, until now. This film has allowed Langella's acting range and versatility to glow into THE performance of 2008. Langella literally becomes Nixon, shaping his subtle mannerisms and guttural tone. And yet, Langella does even one better. He somehow shapes Nixon's attitudes as if he understood who Nixon was on the inside as well as the outside. Good actors can mimic facial expressions. It takes a superb acting of uncommon ability to portray the inner qualities of his/her subject. Langella brings forth the inner Nixon in the same way that the real David Frost did 30 years ago.Equally superb is the portrayal of David Frost by Michael Sheen. Similar to Langella, Sheen also brings forth the inner Frost, the sort of sexy rock star interviewer who must turn into something he has never been: a tough journalist probing the inner meat of his interviewee. The film very slowly shows us the transition of Frost into the kind of journalist he had to become in order to face Richard Nixon. No American president is easily knocked down and left bare by the likes of a journalist, and Nixon was no exception. Frost had to have an arsenal of not just tough questions but tough responses if he was going to be able to bring out the inner soul of Nixon. Frost had to discard the chatty sensibility of a Jay Leno or David Letterman and transform himself into the passionate journalist of a Mike Wallace or Christiane Amanpour. A superb film and relevant to the current state of American politics. Nixon had to come clean and Frost was both his judge and his confessor, partially because the former president had resigned. The current president (as of 1/07/09), despite eight years of abuse of power, leaves the office without the stain of impeachment. He will probably never have to answer to a David Frost or a Mike Wallace. What a pity.",1
"I saw Milk a while back, I was really looking forward to it because I had written a paper in my history class on Harvey Milk. We were learning about movements in the 60's and 70's, as a straight female, I saw one of my friends struggling with his sexuality and how hard it was for society, his friends, his own family excepting him for who he was. I wanted to find out more on the history of how we had either moved forward or backwards when it came to rights for homosexuals. Reading Harvey Milk's story was sad but extremely inspirational and looking at what people said about him, he seemed like the most lovable guy in the world. He was funny, charming, and just a wonderful person to be around, it was extremely sad to find out how his life ended and over something so stupid. Milk is one of the best films of 2008, it was made with great taste and Sean Penn delivers the performance of a lifetime playing the infamous Harvey Milk.Unsatisfied with his life and in need of a change, Harvey Milk decides to move to San Francisco with his boyfriend in hoping of a better acceptance. They open Castro Camera in the heart of Eureka Valley, a working class neighborhood in the process of evolving into a predominantly gay neighborhood known as The Castro. Frustrated by the opposition they encounter in the once Irish-Catholic neighborhood, Milk utilizes his background as a businessman to become a gay activist, eventually becoming a mentor for Cleve Jones. After two unsuccessful political campaigns in 1973 and 1975 to become a city supervisor and a third in 1976 for the California State Assembly, Milk finally wins a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977 for District 5. His victory makes him the first openly gay man to be voted into major public office in the United States. Milk subsequently meets fellow Supervisor Dan White, a Vietnam veteran and former police officer and firefighter. White, who is politically and socially conservative, has a difficult relationship with Milk. He has a growing resentment for Milk, largely due to the attention paid to Milk by the press and his colleagues. After working tirelessly against Proposition 6, Milk and his supporters rejoice in the wake of its defeat. The increasingly unstable White is in favor of a supervisor pay raise, but does not get much support, and shortly after supporting the proposition, resigns from the board. He later changes his mind and asks the city to rescind his decision. Mayor Moscone denies his request, after having been lobbied by Milk to not reinstate White, leading to some disturbing acts of violence.I HIGHLY recommend that you watch Milk, this film was extremely moving and really makes you think before you say something stupid because someone else is different from you, not just sexually, but in general. It really breaks your heart to see how hard it must be for people who are different to express themselves and to be rejected by society. Sean plays Harvey with the love and compassion that the real Harvey would respect. We also have some terrific supporting actors: James Franco, Josh Brolin, Emile Hirsch, Diego Luna and Victor Garber. Milk was one of the best films of 2008, watch it, learn from it, and remember: do onto others as you would do onto yourself.10/10",1
"The last Gus Van Sant movie I saw was 'Elephant', a film that did not work for me. Thankfully he is back with 'Milk' which pretty much gives a detailed account of the rise of Harvey Milk and his martyrdom. Van Sant uses live footage between scenes which reminds one of how much harsher the world once was to people who were 'different'. The writing is stupendous and the dialogues are especially effective. The portrayal of the characters are very human. There is no hero or villain. There are just humans with flaws, humans fighting for what they believe in. Van Sant sets a tense and chaotic tone right from the beginning. The 70s atmosphere is well created through makeup and costumes. The use of brownish tinted light may arise nostalgia. It is two remarkable performances that make 'Milk' stand out: Sean Penn's very accurate and nuanced portrayal of Harvey Milk and Josh Brolin's layered portrayal of a complex Dan White. I doubt 'Milk' would have been effective enough if it weren't for such strong acting. The director deserves mention for his brilliant work. Movies like 'Milk' are relevant today because they serve as a reminder of how difficult life once was and how people fought against it and lives were sacrificed in order to create a better society for those living in today's world.",1
"Enormously moving film/document about the raise and fall of Harvey Milk. If you don't know who he was, you will. The most startling feature of the film is the casting of Sean Penn. A stroke of genius. I, personally, never would have though that the range of this fantastic actor was as wide as this. He took me over and convinced me. I was watching Harvey Milk himself and Penn with the extraordinary support of his director never betrays that illusion. I'm sorry ""Milk"" didn't come out a few weeks ago. For those in California having to vote for Proposition 8, it would have been easier to decide just by watching Anita Bryant ranting about the evils of homosexuality. She sounded ridiculous then, Im sure, but today she sounds ridiculously ancestral. The vision of Harvey Milk is still, unfulfilled but we're certainly getting closer. Gus Van Sant surrounds our hero by an extraordinary group of young actors, in particular Emile Hirsch, James Franco and a superlative Josh Brolin. Not to be missed.",1
"It happened only 30 years ago but it looks and feels as if it had been much, much longer and yet we're still dealing with many of the same issues. Gus Van Sant moves slightly and respectfully to mainstream to tell us this inspiring and tragic story. Sean Penn is superb as Harvey Milk, none of the traits that made him famous are present here, other than his talent that is, he exudes a positive sweetness that is compelling and contagious. Josh Brolin as Dan White, manages the impossible by giving the assassin an unexpected but welcome humanity. James Franco as Milk's lover is, quite simply, scrumptious. As it happens with most biopics we're forced to run from event to event to be fair and accurate and ""Milk"" suffers from that. I wanted more insight into Diego Luna's character - the most problematic - and into Emile Hirsch's character but the essentials are here and the essentials must be listed in lyrical terms. History yes but also poetry. Hope as a theme. A triumph!",1
"Milk sees Gus Van Sant return to the mainstream after nearly a decade of divisive 'arthouse' films, a spell he might have felt was necessary after directing ""Psycho"" and ""Finding Forrester"" back to back. The stunning, beautiful ""Gerry"" is still his greatest film in my estimation, but Van Sant's return to near-unanimous mainstream acclaim and some level of box-office success in ""Milk"" actually isn't too far off as far as Van Sant's filmography goes. Some may express disappointment that ""Milk"" is a 'conventional' biopic, but it really isn't conventional at all. True, this could have been the sort of melancholy meditation Van Sant has been going for in recent years, but the best argument against that is that Harvey Milk is not that figure. He's not going to sit quietly and contemplate life. Perhaps he might have before we meet him on the eve of his fortieth birthday, but from that point onwards Harvey Milk was a man of action, of words, a man with the powerful ability to rally people for a cause, and not only gay people. He had a rare sort of energy, and an energetic film was needed to tell his story. Most impressive perhaps about Van Sant's direction and Dustin Lance Black's screenplay is that there are just as many of those melancholic, meditative moments as needed, just enough to make this a compelling character study and not a truly conventional biopic with a hero rather than a main character. The photography here is also simply gorgeous, and the camera work is outstanding, particularly the hand-held work during the rally scenes. It really succeeds in transporting you to 1970's San Francisco. Sean Penn has frequently annoyed me. I respect his abilities, but reserve the right to express my subjective annoyance at what I perceive as sometimes hilarious over-acting. When I found out that he was going to play Harvey Milk I was nervous, since I have admired Harvey Milk ever since I was first exposed to him through the Rob Epstein documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk"", which is still the best movie made about Harvey Milk, with ""Milk"" running a close second, and I doubt Bryan Singer's ""Mayor of Castro Street"" will be a serious contender. I had no reason to be nervous. Penn's performance is one of the most vibrant, fascinating, brilliant performances in years, and one of the most convincing and human. It's not a Harvey Milk impression, it's more than just that, but he truly does capture the 'essence' of Milk, if you will. It is pointless to make a political statement in the body of this review, so take this as one only if you have to: it is disgusting that in 2008 gay rights still a matter of political debate. This film is a powerful, beautiful tribute to the rights movement. It's not a Democrats vs. Republicans film. In fact, it makes it clear that Harvey Milk was once a Republican, and sneaks in footage of Reagan in strong opposition of Proposition 6. Those short scenes should provoke some thought and discussion. They certainly did for me and the people I saw the film with. Ultimately however the film is not about an 'issue'. Harvey Milk says to Dan White that it's not about jobs or rights, that it's their lives that they were and still are fighting for. Ultimately this film is about people, not about issues, not about policy. It's about people who were told they were sick, who were told they were wrong, who were told they would corrupt society, who were accused of being pedophiles and attempting to 'recruit' children to homosexuality. The film is about Harvey Milk, a mere human being who did more for freedom and tolerance than he probably ever understood. ""I am not a candidate, I am part of a movement. The movement is the candidate."" Unfortunately, the fight against the rampant discrimination against and hatred of homosexuals is still not over. Milk's movement lives on, and grows stronger every day. He would be proud of that, and devastated that our society has not truly progressed, but only learned to mask its intolerance and hatred.",1
"I remember back in 1978 when I heard about the assassinations in San Francisco. The screaming headlines read Mayor Moscone Murdered on the tabloid News and Post in New York. You read the article and it said that a San Francisco City Supervisor named Harvey Milk was also killed by another supervisor Dan White.What I didn't know was how much Harvey Milk reflected my own life. A former Goldwater Republican and closeted gay man, he moved to San Francisco and affected a revolution. That was me and three years later I came out and started doing my own thing for the same righteous cause, Milk gave his life for.Milk was not the first openly gay person elected to public office. Elaine Noble and Allan Spears were serving in state legislatures when Milk finally was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Milk was not a single elected official in a large body of legislators. He became the focus of stopping a rollback of our rights that the newly empowered religious right was seeking to do and God help us, still seeks to do. San Francisco no longer is THE gay city as it was in Harvey Milk's last eight years of his life. So many places now have GLBT rights laws, so many have created their own gay culture and network. Still all of us owe so much to Harvey Milk and his circle who would not back down.A few days ago I saw Sean Penn in Bad Boys and to see him 25 years later as Harvey Milk, it's hard to believe the breadth of work that he's done as a player. There's a nomination in this for Best Actor and maybe a second one to go with the one Penn won for Dead Man Walking. You are so taken with his performance that you forget and think you're watching a hidden newsreel of the life of Harvey Milk.Josh Brolin might very well bring home an Oscar for the uptight Dan White, the assassin. What's extraordinary about Brolin's performance is that White is such an ordinary man, trapped with a set of values that taught him to despise anything different than him. There's some suggestion that White was a latent case and that might have been the ultimate reason for his terrible acts. I've seen that happen often enough in my life.In my working days before retirement in 2002 I was the only openly gay person at the New York State Crime Victims Board working there and still am, sad to say. Harvey Milk was brought to political activism by someone he knew being targeted for hate crime homicide which was never solved. In the more enlightened times of the Eighties and Nineties these things still go too often unpunished. Like Harvey these incidents were my reason for involvement.Watching Milk and inner circle many of whom went on to do great things in the Gay Rights movement, I envied them. I certainly put my years in, still do. But I would have given anything to have been involved from the beginning. They have tragic memories, but also wonderful stories to tell about a cause bigger than themselves.And for that reason this review of this wonderful film is dedicated to a gay rights pioneer whom I knew and who recently passed away. Eleanor Cooper did her activism as an emigrant from Tennessee. She dedicated her life to making the world better for her GLBT brothers and sisters for more than 30 years in New York City. She was a prime leader in the passage of New York City's gay rights law. She was unflagging optimist and never lost faith that with education and reason people would get it about us. Her optimism was infectious, buoyed many a spirit in bad times, political and personal.Harvey Milk said that he had not really done anything he was truly proud of at the age of 40 just before moving from New York to San Francisco. If he did nothing else he gave hope and encouragement to untold numbers of young gay people that you're not worthless, that you had a mission on this earth to make the best life you can for yourself and for your brothers and sisters. The best scene in the film is Milk talking to a young kid from Minnesota who was contemplating suicide and who might very well have done it as too many have.The young man's name was Paul. And this review and this film is and should also be dedicated to all the Pauls and Paulas out there who are not going to accept a second class life from ignorant people. Not any place on this globe.",1
"Gus Van Sant's talent and humility allows Harvey Milk to be a the center of this remarkable story without putting himself in front of the camera. Sean Penn shines with a new and extraordinary light as Harvey Milk. His humanity is overwhelming at times. That permanent smile defining his face talks volumes about his faith in people, no matter what. His awareness is filled with truth and innocence, he worries he's about to be 40 and hasn't accomplished anything. Little did he know.The film is constructed brilliantly in a series of vignettes that builds up into a whole fluid narrative. Josh Brolin, as the disturbed Dan White is another standout in a complex and remarkable performance. No cheap shots here. Diego Luna, Joseph Cross and Emile Hirsch are also terrific as the boys around Harvey but it is James Franco who truly gets under your skin. His romantic turn is one of the most compelling gay love stories I've ever seen (and I've seen Brokeback Mountain). Highly recommended!",1
"I had little expectations walking into this film. The trailer for this movie has appeared at almost every feature film I've seen for the last two months. But, the trailer is a facile example of this minutely detailed story of the rise of a leader and his martyrdom. While I'm familiar with the story from other sources (Shilts' ""The Mayor of Castro Street,"" and the 1984 documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk""), Gus Van Sant and his cast bring a new immediacy to this story.None involved in this project could have anticipated the political climate of the premiere of this film: Both the hope of the Obama Presidency and the propaganda that helped Proposition 8 win in California. It seems a perfect environment for this story to reach across America.The dignity with which all of this is told and acted is its success. At the same time, it doesn't shy away from the culture of the Castro. Perhaps the greatest compliment is the rendering of Dan White here. He is neither demonized nor excused.We also don't get a white-washed version of Harvey Milk. He's there on the screen with all his foibles and kinks. Although his humanism shines in Sean Penn's unsettlingly accurate portrayal. It was Milk's love of--and impatience with--the rest of us that makes him a legend. And that is center stage in this film.What Van Sant gives us is both humbling and an inspiration.",1
"Milk' is another powerful mainstream American movie about gay experience. It seems destined to have the same kind of influence on the public mind as Jonathan Demme's 'Philadelphia' and Ang Lee's 'Brokeback Mountain,' both of which were prominent at Oscar time. Like them this isn't a great film but it's an important one.In 'Milk' the topic widens to gay politics and gay rights. ""These are not 'issues,'"" Harvey Milk tells a major opponent, ""these are our lives we're fighting for. "" His own life peaked at a transformative place and time for homosexuals, San Francisco in the 1970's. A San Francisco Supervisor assassinated by the disgruntled conservative Supervisor Dan White in 1978, Milk was the first openly gay man to elected to public office in California. He was a gay activist who gained fame and political clout. ""A homosexual with power--that's scary,"" Milk tells Mayor Moscone--an ally with whom he sparred, and who was assassinated with him.If he hadn't been killed early in his political career Milk might have traded his jocular title of ""Mayor of Castro Street"" (the city's predominantly gay district) for the formal one of Mayor of San Francisco. Dan White himself predicted this.While Milk sought the whole city's attention with a seemingly trivial cause--a ""pooper scooper"" law forcing citizens to clean up after their dogs, he has come to represent a profile in courage--a man willing to face up to Orange County bigots on their own turf, who insisted all gays must come out of the closet to unite in strength. The film doesn't idealize the man; his private life is obviously messy, and despite his preaching, he was in the closet to his own parents. His lover leaves him, and a new Latino boyfriend (Diego Luna) is totally unstable.Every gay advance seems to bring on a backlash. After the 1969 Stonewall Riots (alluded to in news footage as Milk opens) more gay men and lesbians were out and proud, but Anita Bryant, the Florida orange juice advertiser and right-wing Christian gay basher, was on the rampage campaigning for measures all over the country to remove gay rights. In California in 1978 one of her many causes was the Briggs Initiative, Proposition 6, which would have mandated firing all the state's gay teachers.Today, while the election of an African-American as President makes the US look more friendly toward minorities, anti-gay measures are still on ballots in many states at election times. On the same day that Obama was elected, Californian gay people saw the passage of Proposition 8, put over by Mormon money, to outlaw gay marriage in the state.Leaving behind the hermetic, personal wavelength of his best film 'My Own Private Idaho' and the stylized elegance of his recent quartet of films, Van Sant returns to a conventional mode closer to his 'Good Will Hunting' and 'Finding Forrester'--but this time with more scope and more commitment to taking a stand as a gay man with a wide audience. The writer for the film was the former Mormon Justin Lance Black, writer for several gay-related films and the TV series about a polygamist Mormon, ""Big Love."" Harvey Milk (a nicely modulated Sean Penn) first appears recording a tape testament in his final year of life, a scene that bookends the film. Penn's noted for emotionally overwrought roles but his Harvey Milk is someone who rarely loses his cool or his sense of humor even when he meets the hostile Briggs or regularly has to deal with his clueless, inept opponent Dan White (a fine Josh Brolin). Milk mocked the right-wingers' fiction that homosexuals are pedophiles who want to proselytize youth--that gays are made not born--by opening public addresses with, ""My name is Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you."" It's a line often repeated in the film.The movie, as is the way with conventional biopics, paints its subject's life in broad strokes. He meets his young lover Scott Smith (an appealing James Franco) while a corporate drone in New York. They decide to start a new life in San Francisco, and open a camera shop together on Castro Street. Before long Milk is in the thick of political activity, talking to Teamsters and cutting off his beard and pony tail and donning suit and tie to meet the general public.Milk emerges as a true politician. Moscone compares him to Boss Tweed. Through leading a successful boycott of Coors beer for the Teamsters, he forges strong links with labor. Scenes are crowded with political coworkers, and resident cute boys.Most of all the movie is a picture of community organizing and campaign management. This is told in broad stroke too, but there are many historically specific personalities. Milk ran for office many times before redistricting made a clear win possible. Scotty is his manager, till he can't bear another losing campaign and moves out. Next Milk ""recruits"" a cocky young runaway and street hustler, Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch), who claims he can get a thousand gay men on the street on demand and also boasts ""I don't do losing."" With his new well-connected lesbian campaign manager Anne Kronenberg (Alison Pill) he secures endorsements from the Bay Guardian and the Chronicle, and he wins handily.It's unusual for a mainstream film to get so much into the practical details of local politics. At the same time Jack is jealous of Scott and Cleve and moving toward a meltdown, and Dan White, having his own more dangerous meltdown, is waiting in the wings.As a San Franciscan I wish the atmosphere of the tragic finale had been properly amplified by a horrified awareness of the Jim Jones massacre, the news of which had emerged barely a week before White shot Moscone and Milk. But otherwise this stands as an essential piece of gay and California history and Van Sant's fluent, lively film couldn't come at a better time.",1
"Let's get one thing out of the way. Is it entertaining? And how! Sean Penn's best performance to date  Oscar quality; Emile Hirsch riotously perfect (best ""supporting?""); James Franco heartbreaking; Diego Luna, devastating; Josh Brolin, flawless. Not one false note in any of the actors  a very complicated story unfolds with absolute clarity. I will be seeing this one again just for the screenplay. I was very gratified that no attempt is made to be ""delicate"" about Harvey Milk's personality, either his sex life or his out-sized ego, which perhaps ironically for some, makes him all the more heroic. The finest ""political"" film I think I've ever seen. It does more than dramatize a strong true story, it captures convincingly the truth about a whole political movement. (One that's as freshly active as today's headlines: Prop 6 or Prop 8  does it ever end?) There is an ease and familiarity to the ""scene""  to the historical period and place  with very few, small anachronisms, as far as I could tell. This is also the most assured work of Gus Van Sant, a genuine film artist, who here delivers a complete drama with real visual style and brazen wit. The blending of documentary footage is the most seamless I can remember seeing anywhere. The crowd scenes are remarkable, and all of the location shooting miraculously right. For a couple of fast, fast hours, I felt as though I had spent a couple of days  hilarious, intense, inspiring days  immersed in 1970s San Francisco. This movie does what all movies should do. See it.",1
"Just caught the Portland premiere and have a few thoughts.Very thankful this film was made. Until now, it seemed like I was fairly alone in knowing about Harvey's legacy. After ""Milk"" starts getting attention....I hope that a whole new generation will come to know the Mayor of Castro Street (see Randy Shilt's book) and the importance of the gay rights movement.That being said, Van Sant's ""Milk"" is great marriage of art and history. Instead of a dry portrait of an assasinated leader, we get a beautifully rendered flavor of the times, and an intimate vision of a man finding his place within a community and history. Casting is brilliant. Penn inhabits Harvey Milk in a way that few actors I believe would be capable. His physicality and energy is very believable - and it's easy to forget what actor you're watching. After a while...it's just Harvey. I could go on about the supporting cast...all very solid in their own way. James Franco (Scotty) stands out as well....showing his range and willingness to expand as an actor.Kudos all the way around...I see this film getting several nods at Oscar time.Additionally...Rob Epstein's Oscar-winning 1984 documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" is a definite must for anyone who enjoyed this film. I watched it right after ""Milk"" - and am still impressed with how affecting it is.",1
"I never vibrated together with Van Sant, but this time I must say he convinced me.The main merit of ""Milk"" is that it conveys A MORAL PRINCIPLE - in an extraordinarily powerful, and stylish too, way. Or, as it's also stated: ""What matters is the fight, more than the outcome!"" The script, very dense and well organized, follows the fastidious steps of building up a message, at the same time respecting the ingrate historic chronology - the perpetual dilemma of the docudrama. All around this structure, the direction skilfully grows-up the flesh of the human content, social layers and ethical matters. It turns out a definite lesson of movie-making, for all to see and learn.I should also add that my country, Romania, is just passing through the historical stage that ""Milk"" is depicting: pushing homophobia into obsolescence and reaching normality. As such, initially our rating commission came with a positively ludicrous decision: banning ""Milk"" for the 18- audiences, because (hear this, as a pearl of idiocy!) ""It makes propaganda for a certain sexual orientation!"" I gave them a piece of my mind, in my own review, pointing out that the movie only MAKES PROPAGANDA FOR MORALS, so it should be recommended to ALL AGES AUDIENCES, no matter how young! In the end, after an official complain, they relented and lowered the rating to ""not recommended to under-15"". Still silly, but one can't have it all, can we? Thank God, audiences who don't care about this movie will ignore it, and those who do, will see it nonetheless. And become better human beings.",1
"I very nearly gave this movie a miss. I'm pleased I didn't.As with the gay-themed Brokeback Mountain, many might have stayed away till they realised it was more of a movie than that. Milk is a biopic of the murdered gay rights activist, Harvey Milk. But it connects to the audience by being symbolically about everyone, every minority, anybody who has ever been bullied or ashamed to admit their beliefs. It's about the human spirit. The rights of man enshrined in the American Constitution. And it's about the compassion that lets us see our enemies as human beings.Part of this is down to an outstanding script. But much is down to Sean Penn (at times almost unrecognisable in a beard), who handles the role with a winning combination of grit and sensitivity. He becomes the master orator standing for political office. There are characters in his life that have committed suicide because of the shame of being gay. He is the first openly gay man to hold public office and he gives people hope (in much the same way, it may be said, that the similarly charismatic Barak Obama is doing for black people). We see poignant comparisons with Nazi pogroms against anyone who was 'different'. We see the fervent religious right, claiming God on their side, as they preach a message of hate.Righteous hatred is not dead in America. A few hours before seeing Milk, I had watched a horrific documentary about a family of preachers who picket not only 'faggots' but anyone they believe tacitly supports homosexuality (the footage included picketing a dead serviceman's funeral). We have laws against inciting racial hatred. How can they get away with inciting such homophobia? Milk goes back to the 70's. Politicians opposing him label homosexuals with prostitutes and thieves. Deny them any rights. An argument worth pursuing philosophically perhaps, especially as Gordon Brown's UK government is currently trying to demonise prostitution. A thief breaks the laws of property. But homosexuals  and prostitutes for that matter  offend only those whose totalitarian view of the world wish to discriminate against those who, privately and without hurting others, have the audacity to live differently. Common tactics include linking crime by association. And with prostitution there is some evidence of links to crime, although it may be linked more to marginalisation  and prostitutes could always, at least theoretically, become non-prostitutes. Homosexuality, like being black or Jewish, cannot be 'treated.' Gays can rarely, if ever, 'become straight.' And neither is sexual preference an indicator of criminal tendency.Milk takes his arguments to the most hostile of audiences. He debates with remarkable skill. But, although people warm to him for his courage and kindness, his personal life frequently sinks into tatters. Being second fiddle to a political crusader is no joyride. Even if you were straight. Campaign-trail Harvey might be fighting for your life in broad terms, but it won't help you through that long night of dinners for one.Milk admirably avoids the mistake of glossing over common faults of the gay community  notably male aversion (at the time) to lesbians. In a hilarious scene where Harvey hires a lesbian campaign manager, the all-male entourage dissolves into ridiculous girly twittering against her  until, with a few well-chosen words, she proves she's got, 'bigger balls than anyone in the room'. Harvey slowly expands his cause. He realises it can't be just about gay rights. It has to be about everyone's rights. If elected, he has to show genuine concern for everyone's troubles  not just gays. And, after a few political near-slips where he is tempted to cut a deal, he welds himself to a virtuousness in public office that his opponents can only hypocritically claim but not deliver.We know in the first few moments that he is going to die. The rest of the film is told in flashback. Penn, an actor that is occasionally too intense for my liking, has found a film where he can throw every muscle twitch, every watery eye, every shade of emotion, into a character and cause where intensity is called for. In one of the finest performances of his career, he is understated to convey finer feeling, yet passionate on the soap box to an inspirational degree.I was also very pleased to see this praiseworthy development from director Gus Van Sant. Many 'indie' directors start off with great 'artistic' work, only to be eaten up by Hollywood glitz. Van Sant's career is almost the opposite. Having proved his metal with crowd-pleasers like To Die For and Good Will Hunting, he seems gradually to have abandoned all pretensions to mainstream. His Paranoid Park was a masterstroke of subtle evocation in the thriller genre. With Milk, he has applied his skills like a great craftsman, reclaiming self-respect for the serious yet accessible artist.The one nagging criticism of course is, where are all the gay actors? I cannot fault Sean Penn's acting. He is undoubtedly the best actor for the part. But the very message of equality proclaimed so loudly by Hollywood's darling liberal left is still unheeded within their own industry. How many openly gay actors can you name? I thought so . . . And how far have we really got, really, or has apathy set in? As California bans gay marriage, one commentator noted, ""Where were today's Harvey Milks when Proposition 8 was on the ballot?""",1
"Milk is the best film of 2008, hands down. Anyone unfamiliar with the story of Harvey Milk and his murder needs to know it. Those of us who have already read a ton of books and articles about Harvey Milk, and seen the award-winning documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" will find a side of Harvey we had not seen before in this movie so the film really is a must-see whoever you are.The performances by the entire cast are perfection... a notch better than even the best of films. I believe this is due to the story of Harvey Milk, who inspired so many of us and changed the lives of millions of us for the better. Harvey himself surely inspired these great performances. Once you have seen Harvey's smile, and heard Harvey's words, and seen Harvey in action (as we all can do by watching ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" documentary) you can never see the world the same way again.Sean Penn's performance as Harvey could not be bettered by any actor living today, so we owe him a great debt for making this movie, and giving his heart and soul to the role. I believe it is Penn's most mature yet also most lovable role ever. I wanted the movie to go on and on, because I felt like I was actually there in San Francisco in 1978-79. Gus Van Sant recreated that world perfectly, and Sean Penn showed us the potential of this very real man with this unique ability to inspire and transform us. Gus and Sean have each earned a very special chamber in Heaven for giving us this beautiful tribute.",1
"In 1978, San Francisco supervisor Harvey Milk - the first openly gay man to hold public office in the United States - and the city's mayor George Moscone were assassinated by a fellow supervisor Dan White. This film - directed by Gus Van Sant (""Good Will Hunting"") - tells the story from Milk's 40th birthday in 1970 when he was fearful that his life had accomplished too little. It is a terrific performance by Sean Penn in the eponymous role with the actor capturing the speech and body mannerisms of a gay man in an understated way that avoids caricature or stereotyping. James Brolin is also accomplished as the putative killer, unable to come to terms with a changing world.In a bio-pic of this kind where the ending is already known and so clearly signaled, the power of the film comes in its style. A mixture of actual television footage from the time and a grainy and jerky style of cinematography, the real and the reel merge almost seamlessly to present a work with a distinct documentary feel, obviously intentional and perhaps enhanced by the screenplay coming from documentarist (and former Mormon) Dustin Lance Black.If the movie rather glorifies Milk and presents an uncritical portrait of a necessarily controversial character, this is a work which is about more than one man's struggle to achieve electoral power. It is an insight into gay politics that demonstrates the prejudice that had to be overcome, the hard and repeated campaigns that had to be fought, and the compromises and deals that had to be made. In that sense, it shines a torch on politics of any kind.",1
"There's a scene early in this film that is reprised at the end. our hero at 40 says he's done nothing he is proud of, nothing that mattered. Then we follow him in the next 8 years until his death, where he -- we are convinced -- has. Its a patriotic story, and I cried. But the timing is bad for this effect, because its quite clear that in real terms we are not much better off as a nation after thirty years.The country is more driven by Christian fundamentalism than ever, and remains more fundamentalist than, say, Pakistan. Gays are even more attractive scapegoats for rousing the base than ever before. Though the Anita Bryant of the events we see was publicly humiliated, we manufacture Anita substitutes in large numbers.This ran through my mind, because though the life we see may have seemed significant, I wonder. And the same can be said of the film, and that's what this comment is about.Van Sant knows how to make an effective film. This has all sorts of narrative devices based on recall, each of which reinforce the others.Its framed by a tape made by the soon-to-be-murdered activist. It merges staged drama with real news footage (peppered with fake ones). It merges real and imagined threads in his life. Most profoundly, it merges clear ""modern"" visions of the Castro in its day with seemingly genuine footage as we would see it today: grainy, jerky, dated dyes. There are other intermingling of things from the time with modern ones. We notice them because the times are so close. Simple things like colloquialisms, political notions. Bigger things like the carriage of key characters, the cadence of speeches, even street chats.This is all to say that there is a lot of very clever engineering here to fold us into the thing, its times and energies. But is it good enough?Sure, we are glad that a ""movement"" was started. We celebrate his life at the end as we are supposed to. But is the project strong enough to change us? Surely I have encountered films that are powerful enough to turn lives, to crease souls. Does this material deserve something like that, or is it enough to make us feel right for its last hour? Can you have a powerful film and a simple celebration? Can significant true events be recounted in a way that causes more significant events  which is to ask whether the true can come from the true.I only know that this film was fine. It worked well enough to engage and elicit patriotic urges. But I know it isn't good enough. No, and we need those that are.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",1
"Well I'm not sure if this movie will win anything but it certainly made a statement. Milk is about the first openly gay person, Harvey Milk, to be elected to office in America. Milk does a great job in putting face to the gay rights movement which is sorely needed.The acting was superb by the cast all around starting at the top with Sean Penn. As the film wore on Sean Penn became Harvey Milk. It was not just a portrayal he gave, it was a complete absorption of the man himself. Penn gave a very smart, witty and inspiring performance which carried the film throughout. Josh Brolin gave a very convincing supporting performance as Dan White who is one of Harvey Milk's colleagues. The depth that Brolin gave to his portrayal raised some questions about who Dan White really is. If in fact he is a good man or a bad man, if he is corrupt or honorable or even if he is straight or homosexual. Brolin once again proves to be one of the most overlooked actors in these past few years. Emile Hirsch always lights up the screen and continues to do so in here. James Franco though was quite a surprise to watch. I usually can't stand to watch Franco in any type of role but he proved that he can take on serious roles. This movie might be the statement Franco needed to make.The writing and directing was very solid overall allowing a greatly assembled cast to shine in so many aspects and ways. What was done in such a great way was the editing. Specifically the editing of archival footage into the movie. Most of the time I find it a bit distracting or annoying when archival footage is used but in here it was a strength. It was perfectly implemented into the movie giving the feeling that you could take the movie more seriously as a telling of a true story rather than just a movie.Milk was certainly one of the best of 2008 but we will have to see if it can stand the test of time. It made a pretty nice statement but can it win enough hearts and minds to support the gay rights movement like Harvey Milk would have wanted?",1
"Great story, very engaging. It is lead by fantastic performances and amazing writing and direction.Sean Penn gives one of the best male performances of the decade for sure. He captures so realistically what many other actors in the past have done with real life people. He captures all of Harvey Milk's mannerisms and emotion so well. He will certainly get an Oscar nomination, possibly even a win. Now, to the strong supporting performances. Many of the attention has been given to Brolin and Franco, but I thought that Diego Luna gave a very disturbing and real portrayal as Milk's lover, Jack at one point in his life. Yes, it was hard to watch, but I feel that Luna really stood-out, and it is a shame that people have not really recognized him as well. James Franco also gave a very strong performance, as did Emile Hirsch. But, here is a surprise, I did not think Josh Brolin was anything special. He has been the supporting actor who has been getting most Oscar attention, and most nominations and even awards. He was good, no doubt, but he lacked a lot in scenes I thought. I was expecting him to do more, and I am sorry, but I do not think he deserves an Oscar nomination, let alone some awards he has taken home(they should all go to Ledger for his amazing performance as The Joker). But it is not a big deal, like I said, he was good, but just not nearly as good as he is being praised. The screenplay is fabulous. It slides, and it does not linger, and never plays out very easily. The direction is superb, as is the rest of the film.Here is one amazing film, by any means. It grabs you, whether you like biographical films or not. It is a film, and all of the characters you deeply connect with. Certainly one of the year's best films.",1
"Greetings again from the darkness. Bio-Drama based on the political rise of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man elected to office, is much more than that. It is a reminder of just how ridiculous and closed minded the establishment was just 30 short years ago. Seeing Anita Bryant brought back some scary memories and reminds us just how important it is to understand an issue PRIOR to passing judgment.Sean Penn turns in yet another of his seemingly endless top-notch performances. However, this time he is not the brooding, mumbling type ... he is the action-oriented, quick thinking, charismatic leader of the gay movement in the 70's, and he is spot on as Harvey Milk. The film does not portray Milk as a perfect man, but does spend most of the time on his mission to be elected in order to provide a voice for the gay movement.Excellent support work by Emile Hirsch and James Franco, and Josh Brolin takes on the tough role of Dan Brown, a good man who just couldn't understand why people listened to Milk instead of him. I can't comment on Diego Luna's performance, because it is extremely flamboyant. My guess is that is probably an accurate portrayal of Milk's lover.Director Gus Van Sant (Good Will Hunting, Drugstore Cowboy) does a masterful job of capturing the feel of the times through sets and a mixture of news footage and other actual video. We get a feel for the cause without dwelling on the discrimination and outright abuse that this group absorbed. While not a documentary, it is a strong recollection of a very explosive time in U.S. history.",1
"This movie tells the true story of Harvey Bernard Milk, a gay activist who became a politician in order to bring the fight for equal rights to an higher level. Through his power in office he gets the things done that live on the streets, among the gay community.Quite amazing though- and also sad, that the things in this movie actually truly happened. It's great that there was a person such as Harvey Milk but it's sad that there actually had to be a person such as him in the first place to fight for the rights of gay persons.""Milk"" is an inspirational movie about a inspirational and brave person, who really got things done in the short amount of time that he was fully involved in politics. The movie is suffering from some of the same problem as most other biopics though. It shows that it's almost impossible to tell a persons life and his life work in such a short time span. It now is basically the story of Harvey Milk in a nutshell and the movie often makes jumps and the pace is at all times high, which keeps the story going, without ever giving you a moments rest really. This is the main reason why I'm growing less fond of biographic movies. The story of this movie feels like it could had told and delivered so much more. Harvey Milk was a important figure in the fight for gay rights in the '70's and his work in San Fransisco reached out to the rest of the United States as well.Still it's a movie that gets the benefit of the doubt because of its Oscar winning story and the message that this movie sends across. Homosexuality is still a bit of a sensitive subject on which still lays a big taboo in America. This movie had the guts to tell this story and it's also not afraid to show the 'open' sides of the gay community as it is, so you can expect seeing lots of kissing man in this movie, as well as a couple of sex scenes between persons of the same sex.Also a daring brave role from Sean Penn of course, as well as from the other heterosexual actors within the movie, playing homosexual characters. It's not easy playing such an openly gay person when you self are an heterosexual person. It takes really guts, class and talents to act like that in front of the camera and this is also the foremost reason why Sean Penn won an Oscar for his role in this movie. Some other fine actors that appear in this movie are Josh Brolin, James Franco, Diego Luna and new star Emile Hirsch.A great relevant movie, from director Gus Van Sant, who shows good form again with this movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",1
"I saw this last night at the Portland premiere with Gus Van Sant and James Franco among others. This is a powerful work and, in my opinion, Gus Van Sant has taken a big step towards the mainstream in his artistic direction. To me, the person who is by no means a movie expert, it seems that this movie had a much faster, accessible pace than his other movies. There were no long-shots or minutes at a time without dialog, etc.I've really never thought much of Sean Penn before, but, with this role, I expect him to sweep up the awards. Everyone was great in their parts, but he did such an excellent job in portraying the Harvey Milk that I have seen before in clips and documentaries. They did not make out Milk to be a choir-boy, which was one thing I was afraid was going to happen. This story seems long overdue in it's telling, but so completely relevant to today's news.I expect, as the movie hits theaters, this will cause quite a stir, with both sides using it as fodder in their fight. I expect the ratings will reflect this as there are already people giving it 0's who obviously did not attend the premiere. I don't think it deserves a 10 either, but is much, much closer to that end. Looked at objectively, it is a sometimes tearful, sometimes funny movie that was put together masterfully",1
"Just recently saw this film, and I can certainly see why many are calling ""Milk"" one of the best films of 2008. At the end you will stand and cheer due to the performance given by Sean Penn as Harvey Milk who was the first openly gay elected politician to serve in this country. No matter what your political stance is, or no matter what your take is on social and moral issues of our time like homosexuality this masterpiece of a docudrama is moving and touching for the way it shows how history was changed somewhat by one Harvey Milk. Director Gus Van Sant one who is excellent at doing docudramas intersects this film along just fine by showing Milk's relationships with lovers(played by James Franco and Diego Luna)also well displayed is Milk's offbeat sense of humor and his uncanny ability to attract followers all which tie in well with what he was able to accomplish in California's era of a gay ballot proposition proposal.Anyway call him unifier, politician, fighter, icon, inspiration, or hero. Harvey Milk and his life changed history and his courage changed lives. This film to me a good historical docudrama charts mostly the last eight years of Harvey's life starting with Milk in New York City at the age of 40, and clearly Harvey feels he hasn't done a thing in his life so looking for more purpose along with his lover they relocate to San Francisco, California. Here they open up a small business shop called Castro Camera in the heart of a working class place that will soon become a stomping ground for gay people from all around the country. This set in the mid 70's a time when many cities especially San Francisco were experiencing big social movements and outcries from gays. And with this message and the city of San Fran empowering him Milk finally surprises everyone and becomes an outspoken agent for change and notice for all homosexuals by seeking equal rights and opportunities for them all. As the film shows it was a struggle too as this was a time when violence against gays was openly accepted. So in a challenging and compelling twist Milk decides to take a swim into the murky and wavy waters of us guessed it politics.After three unsuccessful attempts at his run for a San Franciso supervisor seat on his fourth run in 1977 Harvey was finally elected to the board of supervisors which was helped out by the newly rezoned district 5. And Milk serves well by fighting for citywide ordinances that protect people from being fired because of their sexual preferences. Yet as shown in the film by real live news reel footage on a nationwide level(good show of realism by Van Sant)Milk knows he's in for a real battle from Christian conservatives and right wing republicans. To add to the drama of the film the political agenda of Harvey is threatened by a newly elected supervisor Dan White(Josh Brolin who is super he always gives us our moneys worth)this all leads to a dangerous and tragically unexpected end for Milk in 1978.Really what more can I say clearly ""Milk"" is one of the best docudramas ever made it's a stirring take on the political process that took an outspoken social stand not only for gays, but for Americans that it urges them to get involved and make things happen. Overall great time period piece a fine historical docudrama with a super direction from Van Sant and the supporting performances from Brolin, Emile Hirsch, Diego Luna, and James Franco are great. Most of all Sean Penn is in fantastic form as Harvey Milk his performance is powerful maybe one of the best in film history, he's one of the best actors around Sean gets so involved with his roles. So no matter if your liberal or conservative you will stand up and cheer when you see ""Milk"" an excellent film one of 2008's best.",1
"Seldom Hollywood gets it this right, from the assured direction of Van Sant to the excellent work done by the perfectly cast actors. Overall there is a sense of reality that heightens the pain and seriousness of the situation, a painful reminder of human perspectives and how easily we tend to overlook what is best for us and take sides in order to please segments of the population.It's the story of a man who believed in making a difference and thought he would never be able to leave a mark. Throughout the film, Penn makes sure that the vulnerability, insecurity, and steely determination are flawlessly portrayed. He never creates a hero or a superman, he recreates the multifaceted individual who happened to become a crucial part of a movement that needed to be heard and ensured the rights of many people wouldn't be trampled.Many might become upset by the main subject matter, but it is important to show the various sides of the protagonist and one could hope they could go more in depth into who Dan White was, and most importantly what made him tick and eventually explode.The film is rich and filmed with a sense of realism that evokes the cinema of the 70's. It feels importantly because it deals with serious subject matter, treats it with respect, and seems to have a feeling of objectivity, giving it a very real and grave tone.It is perfectly anchored by some of the best work ever done by Penn, Hirsch, Franco, Luna, and Brolin, actors who have been doing outstanding work in the last few years, but somehow manage to reach even more impressive levels here. It's golden all around.",1
"One of the most remarkable things about Milk is how little controversy has surrounded it. Just three years ago, the release of Brokeback Mountain was met with boycotts from anti-gay activists and sparked picketing of theaters carrying the picture. By comparison, Milk has courted minimal outrage. This may change over the course of the next few weeks as it expands to a national release, and surely Fred Phelps will have more than a few kind words for it, but it's still rather remarkable that the film has managed to produce such little fervor from the public. Even a visit to its IMDb message board reveals far less heated discussions than were present for Brokeback.Is it because it's a biographical film, rather than mere fiction? Probably not, since biographical films have been boycotted in the past, too. I tend to be optimistic on this topic, and like to think that the general public is becoming more comfortable with films like Milk. After all, in the Obama age, hasn't it become positive for us to be more open-minded and tolerant of others? The current generation spent its formative years in the Bush era, watching the Daily Show become more reliable than most reputable news sources. I don't mean to sound like Keith Olbermann, but American culture has changed rather distinctly within the past decade, and it's refreshing to see a great film judged on its artistic merits, of which it has many.Harvey Milk was the first openly gay politician in American history, elected to office in San Francisco in 1977. He was assassinated by Dan White, a resigned city supervisor, in 1978. These are the textbook facts, but the movie sheds some light on Milk's personal life, painting a fair portrait of a complex man  from his relationship with a younger male, Scott Smith (James Franco), to his journey into politics, to his untimely demise.Sean Penn's performance as Milk is almost certain to earn him an Oscar nomination. He seemingly channels the spirit of Milk, completely disappearing into character. It's a great performance, but not surprisingly so  Penn has become consistent enough that even in his lesser films he manages to create brilliant work, so it's no shocker to witness what he does with Milk. It's a testament to his strengths as an actor that you find yourself acknowledging Harvey Milk not as a mere character, or as a Sean Penn impression, but as a real person; you don't, at any time, actually feel like you're watching an actor on screen. The only other lead acting performance that may come close to this one in the year-end Oscar race is Mickey Rourke's turn in The Wrestler, with both performances focusing on what are essentially tormented and misunderstood souls.The supporting cast is up to par, too. Franco, as Milk's true love, is given slightly less to do with a character who vanishes for most of the film's middle portion, but with his work here and a great comedic performance in this year's Pineapple Express, Franco is fast establishing himself as a true talent. Emile Hirsch, as real-life activist and campaign worker Cleve Jones, turns in a humorous but affecting performance that probably won't win him any supporting standalone recognition from Penn, but helps reinforce Hirsch's direction towards becoming one of the best actors of his generation. It must also be said that Josh Brolin handles the thankless task of portraying the relative ""villain"" of the film, Dan White, with all the despair of a tragic hero. We feel that White's early intentions are earnest and goodwilled  he even invites Milk to his child's baptism  but as the events progress, Milk becomes distanced from White's policies, and White falls from glory, resigning from his position after what he perceives to be a public embarrassment at the hands of Milk, and then  after pleading to have his job back  is met with dismissal. White doesn't seem ""evil"" or even all that unlikeable  just unstable, with repressed feelings (in more ways than one, as the film implies) and a fairly dark side. We don't hate him, by the end of the film, because he is given a remarkable amount of depth despite Brolin's limited screen time.One could view this film as a passion project for director Gus Van Sant, who had subsided into independent films for a few years after the mainstream successes of Good Will Hunting and Finding Forrester, but perhaps found identification with the themes of Milk. The movie arrives at an opportune time, with its focus on the Prop 6 controversy in the 1970s immediately finding relevance with the current Prop 8 vote. Some of the vintage news footage shown in the movie, featuring interviews with anti-gay activists of the time like Anita Bryant, seem amusingly dated  until you realize how they, too, are uncomfortably relevant in our day and age.Ultimately, the movie tells us that Harvey Milk wanted to bring about change, and shows us how he made quite an impact during his short-lived political career. The film serves him justice, and  thanks to a faultless cast and a great director  is one of the best of the year.",1
"This is the 4th Best Picture nominee I have seen. Honestly, I do not think I would even watch it if it were not nominated. I do not really like Sean Penn. Even his Oscar-winning role in ""Mystic River"" did not really work for me as I found it to be overacting.Sean Penn already won the SAG Best Actor award for this performance and he is the front runner in the Oscar race. I do not know the real Harvey Milk, so this is just Sean Penn acting gay for me. He was good in giving powerful political speeches, but nothing really spectacular. I do not get the love, sorry. The nominated role of Josh Brolin as Milk's political nemesis Dan White lacks something in the way the role was written and executed. His motivations are not clearly rationalized. And his acting was quite leaden, especially in the ""drunk"" scene.As for the ensemble acting, OK, I would agree that they were good in portraying homosexuals. However, Diego Luna is too over the top as the unstable Latino toyboy. Emile Hirsch's character Cleve came out of nowhere, I do not know why he was there. High School Musical's Lucas Grabeel surprisingly appears here in a very un-Disney role, but very minor though.However, the revelation here is James Franco. He is actually very good as the loyal boyfriend Scott. He showed a different dimension in his acting range. He should have been nominated for Supporting Actor instead of Brolin, in my opinion.""Milk"" has a good documentary feel to it, and that is thanks to the directorial talent of Guy Van Sant. I like the mix of historical clips and the recreated scenes. I guess it is just that the subject matter that I do not really care for, so the whole movie did not matter to me.",1
"Kate Winslet is just outstanding in this very interesting film that is almost two stories-in-one. The first part is a sexual story of an older woman having affairs with a teenage boy and the second part is her war crimes tale and what happens afterward. The first is a somewhat happy jaunt of a short story and the second is a very serious and depressing story. That's where Winslet really shines. Obviously, she's developed into an an outstanding actress.The second part is what most people, I assume, will remember about this film. Can ""Hanna Schmitz,"" a Nazi employee (so to speak), who was part of concentration camps, be a sympathetic character? To me, that's what it looked like that's the question the story was asking. The answer may have come in the final minutes of the movie when her ex-lover ""Michael Berg,"" now grown up and played by Ralph Fiennes, confronts a survivor of the camp. That, too, was very intense and interesting scene. Lena Olin is riveting as ""Rose/Illana Mather."" ""The Reader"" was full of quiet, but intense scenes. This is a very thought-provoking film, especially for one that doesn't start off that way but look almost like some soft-porn flick to get our attention. It is anything but that.For Germans, this film must bring out many emotions and thoughts. Guilt and forgiveness are just two of the issues that are dealt with in this unique film. ""Hanna Schmitz"" turns out to be an incredibly simple-yet-complex person, unlike any I've encountered on film in a long time. You see her in all kinds of light, both good and bad.Kudos, too, to David Kross' acting as the young Michael Berg. It must be strange for someone his age (barely turned 18) to do the scenes he did with 30-something Winslet.Overall, a very different and excellent film that stays with you and makes you ponder its main characters.",1
"Post-WWII Germany: Nearly a decade after his affair with an older woman came to a mysterious end, law student Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) re-encounters his former lover (Kate Winslet) as she defends herself in a war-crime trial.The film raises the question of whether we should judge someone by the law or rather ""the laws of the time"". And there is a big difference. Of course we know that killing is morally wrong, and those who sent people to death in World War II were morally in the wrong, even if they were only following orders.But were they legally wrong? One could argue not. That is a difficult topic. Like the women of this film, those at the Nuremberg Trial were tried and convicted under laws invented after the war. Laws written by the winners. This makes one wonder: is it right to put someone on trial for something morally wrong, even if it was not legally wrong? And who should decide the laws? Had the Axis won, they could have just as easily declared it illegal to drop atomic bombs on innocent villages and then try, convict and execute Harry Truman.Right and wrong is no easy topic.",1
"Kate Winslet, I absolutely adore her, she's my favorite actress of all time. I still can't believe that she hadn't won an Oscar, her first nomination was in 1995 with Sense and Sensibility. Finally after 14 long years, she finally won the coveted award with the movie The Reader. I finally was able to see this movie the other day and it blew me away, I'm still debating if this really was my favorite Kate Winslet performance, but once again with a strong cast telling a powerful story, The Reader was definitely one of the best films out of 2008. So many holocaust films have been made, it's hard to make another that stands out, but we really haven't had a story where the Nazi guards were on trial. A lot of people debate if this movie is trying too hard to push sympathy on Kate Winslet's character, but my love for this film is to just show that they were human as well, hard to believe, but that our mothers, sisters, friends, whoever could have done something so shameful.Michael Berg in 1995 Berlin watches an S-Bahn pass by, flashing back to a tram in 1958 Neustadt. A teenage Michael gets off because he is feeling sick and wanders around the streets afterwards, finally pausing in the entryway of a nearby apartment building where he vomits. Hanna Schmitz, the tram conductor, comes in and assists him in returning home. The 36 year old Hanna seduces and begins an affair with the 15 year old boy. During their liaisons, at her apartment, he reads to her literary works he is studying. After a bicycling trip, Hanna learns she is being promoted to a clerical job at the tram company. She abruptly moves without leaving a trace. The adult Michael, a lawyer, at Heidelberg University law school in 1966. As part of a special seminar taught by Professor Rohl, a camp survivor, he observes a trial of several women who were accused of letting 300 Jewish women die in a burning church when they were SS guards on the death march following the 1944 evacuation of Auschwitz. Hanna is one of the defendants. Stunned, Michael visits a former camp himself. The trial divides the seminar, with one student angrily saying there is nothing to be learned from it other than that evil acts occurred and that the older generation of Germans should kill themselves for their failure to act then. But Michael is conflicted on what to do, if to speak out on Hannah's behalf on some of her innocence in the murders or keep quiet. This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen, it was so incredible and just heart breaking. One of the things I respected about the film was the way they handled the awkward ""love story"" between Michael and Hannah, she's older, he's younger, but it's not even a perverted thing, so strange to say that. I don't know how to put it exactly, but their connection was real and in some sense they both needed each other. If you have the chance to see this movie, I seriously suggest that you take it, the powerful performances really make this film captivating. The story is so heart wrenching and painful, but was told so well. Kate now finally has the award she's deserved for so long and pulls in a terrific performance with The Reader.10/10",1
"What is guilt? I believe this is the central question behind Stephen Daldry's new film The Reader. Based on the novel by Bernhard Schlink, the story asks its audience what a true monster is. If you know a secret, one that could exonerate someone from being found guilty of murder, should you help her even though you know she's accepted her guilt despite being unable to stop it? What if that person was someone you loved? There is some heavy material thrown about in the second half of this film, emotions run high and people must make decisions concerning some very dire situations. One thing is for sure, though, once that decision is made, no matter which side of the fence you fall on, some shred of guilt, some feeling of remorse, is inevitably going to follow you around for the rest of your life. This is what we call being human, because as Bruno Ganz's Professor Rohl says, ""our justice is governed by laws, not morals."" It doesn't matter whether something was right or wrong, it's whether it was legal or illegal. Unfortunately our souls don't work that way.As said, these moral quandaries crop up in the brilliantly paced and constructed second half of the film. The power involved in the characters' actions all weigh heavy on those they touch. Perhaps the weight would not feel as palpable without the events of the first act, but either way, that portion of the film is too light and innocuous. We learn about young Michael Berg's, (a wonderful turn by David Kross, who is the true star of the film), affair with an older woman named Hanna Schmitz. This woman is very troubled and in a state of constant flux where her emotions are concerned. She loves Berg, but can never quite allow herself to fully commit to that feeling, her past continuously nagging at the back of her head, remembering what it was she used to do with those who read to her. Kate Winslet's performance as Hanna is quite good, but like the film itself, doesn't come into its own until the second act, when all the secrets finally become uncovered.It is a good beginning, the unabashed love of a young 15 year old and his first sexual partner. He becomes her orator of stories and partner in romance, but they both know it could never last. School would be commencing and Berg would see the young girls his age, ever comparing them to Hanna, and her manifesting his feelings with her own jealousy, knowing that she must let him go  this time sending herself away rather than those she ""befriended"" of her past, those she sent off to whatever fate awaited them. Whether this violation became so deeply rooted in the boy, I'm not sure, but when he goes off to law school and crosses paths with his first love again, this time as she awaits charges of Nazi war crimes, he is torn on what is morally correct. It becomes his obligation to let the truth come out, despite the activities she partook in during the Holocaust. According to the law, he must divulge the information for justice, but his moral compass may not be able to do so.The story truly is wonderfully acted and directed, pulling at the audience's emotions and engaging them throughout. However, while the second half is the most intriguing and resonant, it also contains the one activity that I found abhorrent. Now older, Michael Berg is played by Ralph Fiennes, a lawyer, recently divorced and with a daughter. His journey back home, to his mother that has all but given up on him as a distant figure unable to open up to those that love him, becomes one of returning memories. Discovering the books he once read to Hanna almost two decades earlier, the guilt of what he didn't do makes him set upon a mission to right that wrong. But the way in which he does so is really quite wrong to me. He seems to condemn her for what she did still and only creates cassettes of stories to send her to assuage his own selfish need for forgiveness. He never appears to care about her, because if he did, he would have made different choices in that courtroom years before. Berg shows the selfishness that followed him the entire story and really got me thinking that maybe he was a worse human being than Hanna. It's an interesting dynamic to be sure, one that subverts the somewhat ""touching"" conclusion the filmmakers seem to want to attempt.The Reader is an interesting look at German guilt and the people's need to place blame on others for the Holocaust in order to somehow absolve their own indifference of doing nothing when they themselves knew what was going on. One of Berg's classmates gets the whole issue correct in a little tirade about the absurdity of the trial. Here they all were, guilty themselves of knowing what went on in the thousands of camps, yet putting on trial only six women because a survivor, (interesting to see Lena Olin play a mother and daughterthe beauty of a film spanning decades), wrote a book fingering them. Just as Germany needed to place blame, so did Michael Berg. Rather than put it on his own shoulders though, like Hanna eventually selflessly does, he decides to side with the masses, sitting back silently and then trying in earnest to deal with his eventual guilt, not to apologize to the person he let down, but to somehow forgive himself. It is quite the despicable act and I'm not sure if that was the filmmakers' intent, however, that is the lasting impression it left on me.",1
"The film is a series of profound moral dilemmaswhile contrived by the author, they are fair questionsthat resonate deeply in the 21st Century: The role of guilt in victims, perpetrators, individuals and collectively, as well as justice, forgiveness, redemption, shame and, of course, literacy and its role in Western thought.All this is a pretty heady mix for a film, but Stephen Daldry (as with ""The Hours"" ) makes literary conceit play very naturally here. David Hare's screenplay and the remarkable cinematography of the always remarkable Roger Deakins together with a sensitive score by Nico Muhly, this is indeed rarefied film-making. But the actors are what drag the audience into this story. David Kross is amazing as the young Michael who has to play a range of virginal innocent to wizened and bitter. It's the key role in the film, and we're all lucky he was found to play this role. And the ever confounding Kate Winslet. What an amazing career for this young actress! Running through a list of her credits, she has some of the best performances of the last decade: ""Holy Smoke,"" ""Eternal Sunshine,"" ""Iris,"" ""Finding Neverland,"" ""Little Children."" But here she does something very different. Playing what amounts to a monster, we see that they too are human. Not many actresses could bring this off, but it may be her greatest accomplishment to date. Ralph Fiennes brings a continuity to the work David Kross begins, and there's a brief appearance by Lena Olin who commands the dignity the role deserves. I'm puzzled at the lukewarm reception to this film. I almost missed seeing it. And it turned out to be one of my favorite and the most heart-rending films of the year. All involved should be very proud.",1
"Before I start reviewing, let me say something personal: As a German, one can hardly watch movies about the Holocaust, WWII or any related topic unbiased. As I have discovered myself, no German family is without a history related to the Third Reich, almost none are without grave guilt, or at least the fear thereof, and most who say otherwise either lie knowingly, or simply try to evade further inquiry. Reading some of the other reviews, I realized that for me, the movie conveyed something slightly, but decisively different: It is not so much about understanding HOW people could ever do the things they did, but rather how it is possible, that people we love, and people that have been loved by people we love could be so guilty and so loving, so despicable and lovable at the same time. It is about how we expect the guilt to show up somehow, how we expect to know the killer, the monster, at first sight and say: how could anyone not have seen it? Yet we have to admit sooner or later, that we were wrong, or were we? The question really is: How could I have ever loved someone who did things as horrible and disgusting as Hannah did? And just as much: If I am unmerciful now, having learned of their guilt, is it because they did what they did, or because they disappointed my own belief in their innocence?At one point, Hanna Schmitz asks the judge: ""What would you have done?"", and I think that therein lies an even more disturbing and unsettling question: What would I have done? What would you have done? How can anyone know for sure what WE would done? It is too easy to think of oneself as morally sound, with a firm belief in what is right and wrong. It's what Germans call the ""mercy of late birth"" - the luxury of not having been in the position to make that choice. So, what made this movie worth giving the full 10 points out of 10? It is well-crafted, well-played, believable, at times even beautiful. It captures both the fascination Michael feels with Hannah, and his disbelief, even disgust while exploring the ugly truth about her past. It conveys the struggle between our compassion and the reluctance to show mercy against the ones who did not. It leaves the viewer with the same, disturbing questions that have not been answered sufficiently in the past 60 years (nor will they ever be). It does not provide simple answers, but rather raises more questions, left to be unanswered. As Lena Olin's Character says: ""If you want Catharsis, go to the theater!""Other than providing beautiful, well-toned cinematography, a well-written script, love of detail and convincing performances even by the supporting cast - what more can you expect from a truly great movie?",1
"While taking a German course in undergrad, I read Bernhard Schlink's 1995 novel ""Der Vorleser"" (which more accurately translates to ""the narrator""). I naturally thought that it would make an interesting movie. Sure enough, they eventually made one. It took me several years before I got around to seeing it, but now I have.The main gist of ""The Reader"" centers on the complexity of Hanna Schmitz as a person, but also on responsibility for one's actions. Hanna might have been merely a cog in the machine, but that doesn't excuse her deeds. Indeed, part of the purpose of writing the novel was so that Germany could collectively accept responsibility for its actions.Kate Winslet (who won a well deserved Oscar for the decidedly unglamorous role) portrays Hanna as a tragic figure, someone who might have not fully understood what she was doing but probably should have, and so she did eventually have to face the consequences. In the end, it doesn't matter whether or not Hanna understood what she was doing; she still made the choice to do it.Ralph Fiennes plays Hanna's paramour as an adult, doing what he can for her (while knowing full well what she did). Nonetheless, the movie belongs to Winslet. This is another masterpiece from Stephen Daldry, also the director of ""Billy Elliot"", ""The Hours"", and ""Trash"" (about some boys in Brazil's slums).",1
"Wow, I don't know what to make of this picture. It's so good as a fictional story that it feels like it could be a true one. It presents many moral dilemmas, not the least of which is it's treatment of Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) as almost a sympathetic character when in reality she was something of a monster. During her trial, Hanna uses a standard defense used by many former Nazi defendants who stated that they were merely doing their job in whatever capacity they were employed. In one respect, one could almost make the case that there was an element of mental illness involved in her make up, particularly when she comments on why she didn't allow the prisoners in the burning church an opportunity to escape and survive. There's that, and Hanna's overwhelming obsession to keep her illiteracy a secret, to the extent of taking the fall for the other women on trial with her who may have had even more culpability, if that were even possible.I'd like to say that Kate Winslet deserved her Best Actress Win for the picture but I haven't seen any of the other films her competition appeared in. Strictly speaking though, Winslet's performance arcs through all the ranges of human experience one can imagine and presents a thoroughly conflicted character. Ralph Fiennes also turns in a worthy performance, and I would have to concur with another reviewer who felt that the character Michael Berg may indeed have lived a wasted life. His attempt at rehabilitating Hanna in her prison cell may have seemed noteworthy, but one wonders how much of it was done out of compassion and how much out of guilt.What probably appalled me most about the story was when the five women on trial with Hanna all received a mere sentence of four years and three months for their role as concentration camp guards. Even if one were to apply some sort of moral equivalency to their role along side Hanna, the idea that Hanna received a life sentence made their punishment seem minor by comparison. All because their feigned indignation made Hanna out to be the leader of the group, when in fact, any one of them could have expressed some humanity during the church incident that the others might have fallen in line with.",1
"Directed by Stephen Daldry and written by David Hare, ""The Reader"" is a thought-provoking and surprising drama that takes the viewer in several different directions. Though some reviewers on this site are critical of Daldry and the film, in lesser hands, ""The Reader"" would be a total, erratic mess.The story is told in flashback as the adult Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes) remembers his youth. As a 15-year-old boy, the young Michael (David Kross) has his first forays into sex with an older woman, Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) in 1958 Berlin. She helps him when he winds up on her doorstep, ill with scarlet fever; he returns to thank her when he's well. The two enter into a sexual relationship. As part of their time together, Hanna has Michael read to her. One day, Hanna simply disappears. The next time Michael sees her is in 1966, when he is a law student in Heidelberg and his class travels to watch a trial. It is then he realizes not one secret that Hanna carried with her, but two.""The Reader"" is, above all, a very human story of real, conflicted human beings, and the brilliant performances reflect this. David Kross is exceptional as the young Michael, in the throes of first, blinding passion, who, in the face of the truth about the woman he loved, endeavors to understand her nonetheless. Kate Winslet is magnificent, and that's the only word for her. Hardened by life and her unsentimental and uncompromising view of the world, she is cut off from people due to a secret she considers shameful. With Michael she allows herself some softness, and gives in to not only passion but emotion, sobbing when Michael reads a sad story to her. Winslet shows us all of this, her need to connect with someone, and her strict view of life. Ralph Fiennes turns in another excellent performance; Michael's world and his own isolation were shaped by Hanna. As an adult, he still grapples with a decision he made and his own guilt; he still tries to understand not only her but how he could love her, and in the midst of all of these complex emotions, he believes he owes her something. He ends up giving her the greatest gift he could - her dignity.As with ""Dead Man Walking,"" there is more to a person than his or her actions, reprehensible though they may be. We are not, after all, what we do but who we are. While some crimes are unforgivable, there is, shockingly, at times a connection with the perpetrator that allows us to see the person and extend a consideration that person never gave another. Thus murderers have loving parents and family, and someone who showed inhumanity to others has a little humanity shown them.A very remarkable story.",1
"Like all works of art that endeavor to ""illuminate"" the Holocaust, ""The Reader"" ultimately finds itself looking for answers where none can be found. Yet, the beauty of the film is that it seems to acknowledge the impossibility of its task. Thus, rather than trying to resolve all the issues it raises, the movie simply lays them out before us, trusting that, in the final analysis, we will be able to come to our own conclusions about what, if anything, it all ""means.""Though it is set in a number of different time periods, the story proper begins in 1958, when a 15-year-old German boy by the name of Michael Berg is seduced by a 38-year-old woman named Hanna Schmitz. For a summer, the two carry on a secret, illicit affair, wherein the woman introduces the boy to the joys of physical love, while he reciprocates by reading the classics to her between bouts of passionate lovemaking. Flash forward to 1966 when Michael, now a university law student, discovers, much to his horror, that this very same Hanna who meant so much to him in his youth is actually a former concentration camp guard currently standing trial for war crimes. The story goes even further ahead in time as a now middle-aged Michael keeps up the relationship by sending his personalized recordings of books to Hanna as she serves out her time in prison.There has been some criticism leveled against the film that it aims to cast a Nazi mass murderer in a ""sympathetic"" light. Yet, what ultimately comes across in the story is not how ""likable"" a person Hanna is but how sadly tragic. Like all fine drama, ""The Reader"" goes beyond the two-dimensional stereotypes of heroes and villains to examine the complexity of human relationships and the messiness of the human condition. The movie keeps us emotionally off-balance throughout. Even in the early stages of the courtship, we are torn between our attraction to the characters as individuals and our revulsion at the difference in their ages. Hanna is particularly enigmatic as she embraces a child two decades her junior yet seems to find some strange fulfillment in him that goes beyond the obvious physicality of their relationship. Despite the touchy nature of these scenes, we get a feel for what brings these two very different characters together at this particular moment in time.As the story moves on, the screenplay confronts many of the thornier issues surrounding what exactly happened in Germany in the middle of the Twentieth Century, questioning how so many ""average"" people could, at best, have turned a blind eye to the events that were occurring, and, at worst, have allowed themselves to become complicit in the mass atrocities. There's a beautifully incisive scene in which a young law student confronts his professor, demanding to know how the man has been able to live with himself for all these years, knowing that he did not do everything within his power to try and stop what was happening. In that brief, shining moment, we get a sense of what it must have been like for the people in Germany in the decades following the war when so many, Hanna included, simply turned their backs on the past in an effort to move on with their lives.Perhaps the most complex character in the story is Michael, who, as he ages and learns more and more hidden truths about his first love, must come to terms with the fact that the woman he thought he knew on the most intimate of terms may, in fact, be an unrepentant mass murderer. Yet, love is not something that can be turned on and off at will, and it takes Michael decades to figure out just how best to deal with the moral dilemma raging in the very depths of his soul.Michael is played first by David Kross in the period from 1958 to 1966, and then by Ralph Fiennes in the time thereafter. Both are superb, with Kross, in particular, delivering a performance of such delicacy and sensitivity that he sets the groundwork for what Fiennes is called on to do later in the film. And, of course, Kate Winslet, in the role that won her an Oscar, demonstrates yet again why she is one of the screen's great actresses.Kudos must also go to screenwriter David Hare, who has adapted Bernhard Schlink's complexly structured novel with integrity and taste, and to director Stephen Daldry and cinematographers Chris Menges and Roger Deakins for the sumptuous look they have achieved with the film. Together, these fine artists have created a work that challenges the intellect and roils the emotions.",1
"There's an urgency in human nature to understand. When it comes to the Holocaust, history's bleak, unsettling period, it doesn't matter what book you've read, film you've seen or account you've heard; in the end, your response it halted by its incomprehensible conclusion. How could humanity course its way towards such a violent, destructive path? How could people knowingly send men, women, and children to their impending doom? Most puzzling, how could the world allow it? Even though its been 63 years since the blood-drenched annals of World War II, its aftermath today is still bone chilling.After a six year celluloid dry spell, Stephen Daldry returns to the director's chair in a brilliant, sexually charged, and oddly heartbreaking tale about the complexity of human morality and the lifelong repercussions that result from our actions. Adapted from Bernhard Schlink's best-selling German novel, ""The Reader,"" Daldry's visual translation is a powerful, emotionally absorbing film that is one of the year's best. It's superbly crafted.With World War II over, Germany, in 1958, is still recovering. Deep within Heidelberg, Germany, Michael (David Kross), a young pubescent teenager haven fallen ill, is comforted by Hanna (Kate Winslet), a hard working woman who is twice his age. Taken by her generosity, Michael revisits Hanna to offer his gratitude. What begins as an awkward reunion escalates into a seductive, forbidden affair that intensifies when Michael begins reading to the distant, empty Hanna, who is deeply awakened by Michael's spoken literature. Too young to understand love's complicated implications, Michael is emotionally devastated when Hanna suddenly disappears. Nearly a decade later, unable to forget his passionate summer while studying law, he attends a Nazi trail, and to his dismay, hears Hanna's distant voice.""The Reader"" is a complex film; maybe a little too complex for some. Though the film pertains to Nazism and the ""sins of our fathers,"" in essence, ""The Reader"" is a film that reflects the emotions inside all of us. During a lecture, Michael's professor comments, ""Societies like to think they operate on morality but they don't."" In this cynical age, how far from reality is that statement? During Hanna's trial, she's questioned why she participated in the Nazi party's horrendous war crimes, broken she replies, ""It was my job."" Oddly enough, that seems to be the justification most people use. Surprisingly, though, ""The Reader"" isn't about her exposure as a war criminal, but an exposure on an individual who took the wrong path. She's not a bad person; she's simply made wrong choices. However, when it comes to having involvement in the Nazi's liquidation of the Jews, how ""wrong"" can you get? ""You ask us to think like lawyers,"" cries on student, ""what are we trying to do?"" A distraught Michael replies, ""We are trying to understand!"" But, just who exactly is trying to grasp a deeper understanding: the court or Michael? How can Hanna's past be forgiven? Director Stephen Daldry brings the much needed emotional layer that a character such as Hanna Schmitz desperately needs. Although her actions are beyond unforgivable, strangely, we sympathize with her. Maybe it's her other shameful secret. Maybe it's superb character development.""The Reader"" is a film that is driven by it's raw performances. In one of her finest hours, Kate Winslet gives the performance of a lifetime. It's a haunting and heart-breaking. David Kross, who's only 18, is impressive as the teenager with raging hormones; it's such a daring performance. Winselt and Kross bring this picture together. Their performances are jaw-droppingly brilliant. Completing the role of Michael, as the tortured grown man, is Ralph Fiennes, who balances Michael's despair through his melancholic emotion when he encounters a grown Jewish woman, played by Lena Olin, who was also at Hanna's trail. Although her scenes clock in less than 10 minutes, Olin, too, is breathtaking.When ""The Reader's"" credits rolled, I sat quietly shaken by what I had witnessed. It's a film that is impossible to forget. When a grown Michael asks Hanna, ""Have you spent much time thinking about the past?"" Heartbroken, she replies, ""It doesn't matter what I think. It doesn't matter what I feel. The dead are still dead."" She's right.",1
"Very well acted and presented and a faithful representation of the main points of the novel on which it is based. This film encourages us to look closely at very difficult issues surrounding the atrocities of World War II. I am at a loss to understand why so many critics have been so damning of it. Perhaps it is too subtle for them to understand. It seeks to outlaw the false and intellectually lazy theory to explain the holocaust, namely that the horrors were committed by monsters. In its place we are offered contextualization, not as excuse but as explanation of how quite ordinary people were able to do extraordinarily dreadful things. We avoid these uncomfortable facts at our peril.",1
"Stephen Daldry knows how to tell a story, knows how important it is to make each of those characters relevant and indispensable, more importantly, emotions are finely portrayed, but it is the cerebral quality of his work that both impresses and irritates the audience. Somehow, he let go of his control and made ""Billy Elliot"" exuberant and glorious, with each note and emotion spilling out of the screen. His restraint might have lessened the impact of the dark nature of the tragedy in ""The Hours""; somehow the balance continues in ""The Reader"", a powerful testament to the complexity of humans and their interactions. In ""The Reader"" learning occurs, consequences, origins, and motivations are carefully explored and analyzed, leaving out some of the mystery for us to decide. Choice is key here, and some choices are carry a bigger weight than others. The marvelous Kate Winslet, who should be honoured for the quality of her work, with as much recognition as it is humanly possible portrays the central character of the story, a woman whose life might have been shaped by unfortunate events, mostly undisclosed to us, and some of her own genetic makeup. We, as the lawyers and the students in the film, get to evaluate the evidence and choose to make a statement to justify hers and our own ethical standpoints. It is the intricate and deft interpretation of Hannah that anchors the story. Although, the story follows Michael and their relationship from his teenage years to the devastating conclusion, the film succeeds because Winslet is able to show every bit of the confusion, rationale, and emotion that her character possesses. She seems cold and detached, but as we look, we discover that there is more to her than we can see from the moments we see her on the screen. Hannah carries secrets inside her soul, somehow keeping herself alive, surviving, living an austere existence that hypnotizes, seduces, and repulses those she encounters. Michael is seduced by this mysterious woman, and his own future is shaped by those moments they spend together. What he doesn't realize is how big of an effect their time together will have on his life. Their early scenes are powerful and presented with a strong sense of realism and brevity. They're probable the best of the film and might have to be reviewed to understand how key they are to the further growth of Michael's life and reactions to others. Winslet does not say much, but her manipulations provoke her desired effects. As their paths diverge and meet, their relationship changes as one observes the dramatic turn of events that brings them together again, and how Michael's actions have dire consequences for both of them. It is during this period that we think we begin to see how relative everything: what is moral and immoral, logic and emotional, simple and complex. Highs and lows are hit again, as we become more involved in one of the most powerful and dramatic moments of their lives. In the final act of the film is when Winslet and Feines do some of their most outstanding work ever; she even surpassing her masterful turns in ""Revolutionary Road"", and ""Eternal Sunshine"". Every gesture, every look, every enunciation add details and shed light to who they were, are and might become. It is subtle work, haunting, and bewitching, the work very few people are able to do. ""The Reader"" reaches its amazing conclusion with a couple of scenes that might break whatever little strength we might still have left. ""The Reader"" isn't an important work, but it is a work that should be recognized by the quality of its work, a finely tuned and produced piece of cinema by people who recognize how magical, powerful, and intelligent films can be.",1
"This is an amazingly believable film. The types of dilemmas faced by the characters are the kinds of things that easily could have happened. There's pride and anger and self doubt. This is really a story about a man who has been shaken loose from innocence, who must face the fact that someone he loved or thought he loved could have been a monster. Still, even if she was a monster, we cannot totally condemn her. Kate Winslet is incredible from the sexually driven streetcar conductor to the perpetrator of an event that killed hundreds of Jews. The amazing thing is that she can't get her mind around what she has done. She saw it as a way to find work since everyone was at war and she needed the employment. She is painfully honest which is hard to fathom for the courts. Roy Fiennes has a connection to her because of their affair, but he is still repulsed by the events. Because of his basic human kindness he continues to read to her as he did by recording books on audio tapes (he comes to realize that she can't read or write). There are not simple answers and no last minute discovery; it's about people trying to connect. This is a fine film.",1
"This is a very strange movie in that there are MANY moral dilemmas and situations that clearly are unsavory--yet the film takes a completely neutral stance in presenting the plot. I am sure this offended some but it did make for a very memorable film. As for me, I am still not sure what I think about this strange style of film making.The movie begins with a 16 year-old boy being seduced by a much older woman. The morality of this and their subsequent affair never seems to matter---it just is. During this time, the older woman (Kate Winslet) was often quite moody and the boy's welfare really didn't seem that important. Also, she would force him to read to him before they had sex. Why is an important part of the film--and frankly, though it was apparently supposed to be a twist, I figure this out immediately. However, this didn't spoil the film.One day, Winslet disappears. Exactly why you really don't know. The boy grows and is now in law school. As part of one of his seminar classes, he and the class go to court to observe. The case involves some Nazi war criminals--and it turns out Winslet is among the defendants. And, the fact that she had other 'readers' finally makes the young man realize why. Winslet (this is NOT much of a spoiler) is illiterate. Yet, she is so ashamed of this, she is willing to accept a much longer sentence to hide her illiteracy. And, during her long incarceration, the ex-lover (now played by Ralph Fiennes) makes it his life duty to record book after book for her to enjoy while incarcerated. There's a bit more to the film than this, but I'll leave it up to you to see for yourself.The movie has some excellent acting, though I did wonder why the leads were played by non-Germans--while some other major characters were German-speaking actors (like the Swiss-born Bruno Ganz). I wonder why they didn't just have Germans in all the roles. Perhaps they thought it was more bankable with Fiennes and Winslet. The moody music and direction were perhaps the best part of the film, however---very evocative and well done.As for the plot, I cannot completely reconcile myself with the fact that the film appeared to possibly condone or was indifferent to evil. Sexual exploitation of a teen and the holocaust are BAD....REEEEAAAL bad! And that made me a bit uneasy, as I enjoyed the film and the odd plot. Also, I felt that it was a shame there was so much nudity, as I would love for teens to see the film--it would be great to show them to instigate discussions and provoke exploration.A weird and unique film. Hard to really describe and one you may enjoy but also one that may prove too challenging--as I could really see this causing some viewers to become angry, depressed or too emotionally taxing.By the way, was it just me or am I right that it seems that Fiennes' character wasted his life? And, interestingly, Fiennes also starred in the excruciatingly dull ""The English Patient""--another VERY morally ambiguous film about the Nazis and moral choices.",1
"This isn't meet-cute. Fifteen-year-old schoolboy Michael Berg (David Kross) first encounters his 36-year-old future lover Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) by throwing up in her doorway. It's a dismal rainy day in a German city in 1958 and he has taken ill on the way home from school. She cleans him up and accompanies him to his family. He turns out to have scarlet fever, and is kept at home for months. Once he's well again he goes back carrying a bunch of flowers to thank Hanna for her kindness, but realizes he's turned on, and bolts in embarrassment while she's bathing. Eventually Michael returns and happily loses his virginity. A regular ritual of reading, bathing, and lovemaking develops between him and Hanna. He reads to her; she bathes him; the sex is mutual. She is a tram conductor with a harsh manner, and several huge secrets. She seems to be using Michael, but she's also enjoying him mightily, and he is reaping enormous rewards, though his affair puts pressure on his relations with family and schoolmates.Bernhard Schlink's original The Reader was an international bestseller. A lawyer and judge who writes, Schlink departed from his usual detective stories with this novel that becomes a meditation on Nazism--the denial of the surviving participants and the incomprehension of Germans like Michael who were born in the aftermath. Michael's feelings toward Hanna become much more complicated than simply those of a youth introduced to love by an older woman--as complicated as the feelings of Germans about the demons in their modern past. As for Hanna, she seems to understand nothing and to be more concerned about how she appears than what she has done.The book is in three parts. First there is the love affair of the schoolboy and the tram conductor, which ends abruptly and painfully when Hanna suddenly disappears. In the second part it's eight years later and Michael is a law student attending trials of Nazis with fellow students and their seminar teacher, Professor Rohl (Bruno Ganz). One day the young man is horrified and riveted to learn one of the defendants is none other than his long lost Hanna. She turns out to have been an SS guard at a satellite of Auschwitz and she's on trial with five other women for allegedly allowing several hundred prisoners to burn to death locked inside a church. This trial paralyzes Michael. He has never gotten over his first, interrupted love idyll with Hanna. Now he is filled with guilt for having loved her but also a sense that he should help her when he realizes he has information that might lower her sentence.The last part, thirty years later, consists of several brief visits by Michael, first to Hanna in prison, then to the posh Manhattan flat of a Jewish woman, Rose Mather (Lena Olin), who was at the trial. She was one of the survivors and wrote a book about her experiences that was used in evidence. This provides a kind of coda.Schlink's novel is neat and arresting, a page-turner that conceivably makes you think. Its Holocaust issues are cunningly intertwined with a sensuous--and rather peculiar--coming-of-age story told by a sensitive man still struggling to understand his experience and his country's. I read the book with interest, but found it a bit contrived. This together with Stephen Daldry's previous choice to film Michael Cunningham's The Hours shows a weakness on the English director's part for stories that are a little too clever and schematic.This time the screenplay by the British playwright David Hare does damage to the book by altering its chronology, chopping it up and muddling the original linear three-part structure. Hare has said in interviews that the interpolated device of Michael's telling his story to his grown daughter was necessary to make sense of his voice-over. (That,however, is debatable.) Having settled on this device, Hare felt obligated to keep interjecting the mature Michael, played by Ralph Fiennes, at points throughout the film. The omnipresence of Fiennes' glum face undermines the sense of the young Michael's eagerness and, later, shock and confusion.Fiennes as Michael revisits a cosmetically aged Kate Winslet as Hanna three decades later when she is about to be released from prison. Michael could never bring himself to visit her, but sent her tapes of himself reading the same books he read to her during their affair. Fiennes is a cold fish, hard to relate to the lively and sweet personality of young David Kross.The film is hampered from the outset by its use of the outmoded artifice of dramatizing a story that takes place in another country and another language and yet having everyone speak English, with several of the main characters played by Brits (Winslet, Fiennes) putting on German accents. Bruno Ganz speaks with less of a German accent than they do.There is much of interest in this glossy production, beautifully photographed on location by two of the best DP's in the business, Chris Menges and Roger Deakins. Ganz's professor is an ambiguous, subtle characterization. But since the drama of the unfolding story has been destroyed by breaking it up into pieces, the only thing that remains alive and beautiful and strange are the love scenes between Kross and Winslet. There is good chemistry between the 18-year-old Kross and the 34-year-old Winslet, and their nude scenes are bold and intimate. It's only when the machinery of what Schlink and the filmmakers are trying to tell us about German guilt and denial goes into action that things begin to be clunky and cold. Unfortunately, that is a big part of the picture.",1
"The Reader is one of my favorite movies from the year 2008. It is incredibly complex in the way you react to the characters of the movie. It carries many emotions from sensuality to anger all the way back to that of sympathy and resolution. Many moves advertise themselves as unbiased and fair but nothing gets close to that like The Reader which is able to build sympathy for a character you would never think you could feel towards.The acting in the movie was phenomenal. Especially that of Kate Winslet who draws out many emotions from whoever is watching. She plays an ex-Nazi guard who has an affair with a 16 year old boy played very well by David Kross. Her bitter, cold attitude, random behavior as well as her past history seems unjustifiable and deplorable. Yet you can do nothing more than feel empathy and compassion towards the shame and humiliation she feels about her one well kept secret. In the course of her affair she ask for one thing, to be read to. From this do you see the humanity within her. Ralph Fiennes also gave quite a nice performance as an older Michael Berg who looks back on his life and then later finds a way to open himself up through his time of self reflection and sudden realizations towards life. David Kross plays the younger Michael Berg whose performance was undoubtedly a very good one, maintaining his presence in not letting himself being totally overshadowed. Overall the performances are very deep and will keep you thinking long after you have seen the movie.The directing and writing also was very key to the emotions felt in this movie. Every scene had to be done precisely and consistently to feel genuinely touched rather than feeling falsely drawn in. Stephen Daldry did that under his great subtle direction. The writing by David Hare allowed actors such as Ralph Fiennes, David Kross and of course Kate Winslet to give such stunning and deep performances and take the film to another level.I found this movie to be very compelling in many ways. The emotions felt here were not cheap gimmicks but that of feeling true sympathy and forgiveness towards what we would normally describe as something wrong, shameful and reprehensible. I can't remember another film that made me feel these emotions for a character especially after learning one startling secret after another. This film succeeded in ways that almost movie would likely fail in, it did not come off as generous or light but as remarkably fair as a film or any type of medium can get shedding light on both sides of the spectrum. This is a film that is amazingly thought provoking and will bring out the humanity within all of us and should not be missed.",1
"We don't know. We think we do but we don't. We make decisions or sometimes decisions are made for us but we think we've made them. Then suddenly, there we are. We can't be certain how we got there or where we will be when everything settles but we do know that we are alive. Some experiences are life altering and we can run from them or embrace them. Staying to see them through though can bring incredible bliss but also tormented turmoil. We just never know. One such experience was had by a young Michael Berg (David Kross) and is chronicled in Stephen Daldry's THE READER. How could he know that when he pulled into an alley to be sick that he would meet the woman who would shape his entire life? How could he know that getting close to her would pull him the furthest he's ever been from himself?Of course, when you're a sixteen-year-old boy and a woman who looks like Kate Winslet disrobes in front of you in the privacy of her bathroom, how much thought really goes into the decision that has presented itself? However little it is, it is certainly less than is warranted. This is especially true in West Germany of 1958. This is a Germany that is uncertain how to proceed, how to be its new self in the eyes of the world and the eyes of its very own future generations. Winslet plays Hanna Schmitz, a compassionate woman but also abrasive and stern. Winslet strikes the perfect balance between directness and desire in Schmitz, making her complexities part of her appeal. She is a good fifteen years older than the young Berg and she knows much better than he of her country's history. What he knows, he has read in books, been taught in school. What she knows, she lived first hand. So when the two come together, naked in each other's arms, the meeting is as redemptive as it is passionate. Berg is just happy to be in love and having sex but Schmitz is washing herself clean with the youthful vigor of Germany's tomorrow.The summer ends and so does the affair, as one would expect. Just when it would seem that the two would never meet again, life steps in to ensure that past decisions, perhaps made in haste, can come to see their consequences. Berg has grown some and is a college man, studying to be a lawyer, when he catches sight of Hanna Schmitz again. Their latest chance encounter is far less exciting though as he sees her on a class outing to a courthouse. Schmitz is on trial for crimes against humanity for her time as an officer in the Nazi party during the Second World War. Berg's memory of his first love would now become a question of his own morality. How could he love someone who was now accused of such atrocities? How could he be so intimate with someone he apparently never truly knew? And yet, now that he knows her past, does he really know how her past came to be? After all, what is the face of evil? Is it Hanna Schmitz or is it something incredibly bigger than her?Ralph Fiennes is the future of Germany. He plays Berg as an adult. His life is orderly, very clean, crisp and cold. He made decisions that made him the man he is and he can never say whether they were the right ones or not. What he can see is that we all make decisions that either hurt or harm other people and that the atrocities committed by his past generations are not as far outside the realm of understanding as he might have originally thought. More importantly, redemption is not that far either.",1
"If you have not seen the movie or if you have not heard to plot synopsis please take my word for it, this movie is powerful, it may shake you to the core. It is about hard choices and how we deal with them. Now please stop reading.p l e a s eHanna's secret, that she is illiterate is so crucial to who she is. We tend to understand why she acts as she does, but one of the central and pivotal decisions in the movie is Michael's decision to do nothing about his knowledge of that secret. Pay back for the hurt that she has caused? I do not think so. It is more a decision to honor her startling choice of responsibility for 300 deaths over revelation of her secret. there is no doubt that Hanna also bore guilt for the deaths. She is seemingly the only honest person in the courtroom, telling the truth when all have lied. It is only about herself that she lies. Michael could have confronted her, could have revealed the information to the court in several other ways, certainly through his professor he could access the right people, but he keeps Hanna's secret for her and suffers for it even more than he had before.This is a story of honest and proud people trying to remain true to who they believe themselves to be. She does not intellectualize her decisions, ""I was a guard."" ""You can't let prisoners run loose!"" It never occurred to her to ask why these people were prisoners but one look at her life and we see that she too was a prisoner. This does not absolve her of her guilt, but it does explain her actions. Unlike the other guards she understands too late that there was another way and for that she accepts responsibility.But even more than the admission in court, her decision to send Michael to New York produces the most compelling scene in the movie as the agent of the guard confronts the victim and survivor. It is heady stuff and though the victim is sometimes criticized for being cold and bitchy, how else could she be when a stranger brings such news and an apparent plea for forgiveness. And what seems like a cold inquiry, ""What was your real relationship with that woman?"" turns to be the source of redemption for Michael, he finally admits to another his secrets, in the scope of things they are not big, but they have weighed on him for over 30 years by that time.One last thing, the strange sad, beautiful gift of a tin. It was the wrapping that was more valuable than the gift.I did not always understand the motivation of the actors, but in the end their unexplained motives play out as in real life leaving us the viewers to pick up the pieces and move on.",1
"Okay, now I've seen the two simultaneous Winslet movies. Both are celebrated. Both seem to understand Kate's gift as an actress  that she is one of those rare players who can convey what a character does and also, via another channel, what she thinks or rather what motivates what she does. Its what I've called folded acting, with that second layer being a direct communication with the audience that annotates the first.Its a specific sort of openness, and usually a filmmaker asks her to be obviously open. Both of these men, understanding this, have asked her to do the opposite. She is instead, obviously closed, using that second channel to convey that the channel is there but much is hidden.Both of these films are amazing on this count. Its a new development in film acting in the 50 years or so since folded acting first emerged.But otherwise, oh, what a difference in the two films. The ""Revolutionary"" one is made by her husband apparently just for this one effect. There is no narrative structure, only a stunt. The music is the main character there.This film is wonderfully structured. It as rich in narrative facets as she is, each reinforcing the other. Seeing the two close to each makes me wonder why it isn't obviousThe film starts with us being told that literature, great literature is about hidden information. Then, throughout, we have the thread of the law, both referencing classroom and trial genres except for the focus on what is not revealed. This is folded into the very literature itself that is denied this woman, except in three circumstances: one we hear about and two we see.And THAT is folded into love, its unrelenting yearning that can gnaw, its sex (obsessively, Germanically clean) and its idealistic romances. Both Chekhov and Homer as the templates. Wow, what care!Its a matter of all choices having been discovered and not made. About what daughters do not know. Lena Olin has a career high here playing two generations. Her portrayal of the daughter is profound. We never really understand what happened with her: her mother was the only survivor of a specific situation. It seems that the daughter was born after the war and wrote a book about her mother's plight, never escaping the story.Its all about observing, observing in every dimension and the power of looking even when you cannot seem to see.At the end, there is a remarkable contrast between Hanna's stark cell, indeed everything in Germany we are shown as stark, and the opulent home of the daughter. There, she reminds that illiteracy is not a Jewish problem  this is after literature has been conflated with life.There is a pretty, sexy law student with whom our lad sleeps. She may have become his wife and that one evening the origin of the other daughter. She is played by the same actress who was the Plum Girl in ""Perfume,"" the original womanscent.The role of a certain church is deliberately kept ambiguous. It may in fact be the church that we visit twice. We never really learn what happened there, and its significantly shrouded. That will always be hidden.The same fellow who made this also made the similarly deep ""The Hours"" and the execrable feel good trailer trash ""Billy Elliot."" Go figure.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",1

Years later the man is in law school when he goes to a war-crime trial and sees that the woman has been brought up on charges. What follows will effect his life through adulthood. A few weeks back I said Slumdog Millionaire was my pick for the best movie of 2008 but that has now changed as this film will take the top spot. I expected a great movie walking into this thing but I never imagined how beautiful and touching a movie experience it would turn out to be. The film deals with a lot of ugly situations and has some downright heartbreaking moments but I love movies with great stories being brought to life with great acting. Hopefully the Oscars will treat this film very kindly because it's certainly in a league of its own. The film's basic story has the adult (played by Ralph Fiennes) looking back at his first sexual relationship and the effects it had on his life and especially his estranged relationship with his own daughter. I think a lot of what happens to a young boy will have a major impact on his life and I think that's the greatest thing about this film. What happens to be boy starting with the affair and leading up to the trials make for some very compelling drama. I'd say this is a brilliant coming of age story but I'm not sure if that would be insulting the film since there's so much more to it. The film also does a great job with its rather frank sex and nudity scenes. There's quite a bit of both but the film is very mature about it considering the age of the two people involved. The subject of the age is never mentioned as the film just treats it as one thing that happens among many others. Both Kross and Winslet were very brave in terms of their sexuality but their brilliant performances are the key here. I expected a great performance by Winslet since she's perhaps the greatest actress working today but Kross stands right there with her through the entire film. I think Kross' performance is the real key here as we're seeing all this stuff from his point a view and it's up to him to sell the story and the emotions behind it. The actor handles the awakening of his sexuality brilliantly and he's even better during the trial time scenes where his judgement is going to have a major impact on several people. Fiennes is brilliant as well in his supporting role playing the adult . He has couple emotional scenes, which I won't ruin but his acting inside the jail cell might be the greatest I've seen from him. This is a pretty depressing film from start to finish but that's often the case when you deal with a subject matter like this one. Director Daldry does a masterful job handling the different time periods and putting them all together. The story jumps around from decade to decade but all of this is handled with a problem. In many ways this is a love story and on that level I think the film hits a grand slam and turns out to be a true masterpiece without a single flaw.",1
"Every single day -- 365 days a year -- an attack against children occurs that is 10 times greater than the death toll from the World Trade Center...We know how to prevent these deaths -- we have the biological knowledge and tools to stop this public health travesty, but we're not yet doing it. Jean-Pierre Habicht, professor of epidemiology and nutritional sciences at Cornell.Eight million of the eleven million childhood deaths a year could easily be prevented. That's because almost 60 percent of deaths of children under 5 in the developing world are due to malnutrition and its interactive effects on preventable diseases. Is this not a holocaust? An old Soviet piece of gossip had it that Comrade Khruschev was interrupted during his famous 'secret' speech before the Communist Party elite when he denounced Stalin's crimes in 1956, three years after Stalin's death. A voice from the audience shouted, ""Why didn't you speak out against these crimes when Comrade Stalin was committing them?"" Khruschev looked up from his speech and asked loudly, ""Who said that?"" A long silence ensued after which Khruschev observed, ""That is why."" When you see ""The Reader"", ask yourself why you are doing nothing about the holocaust which is happening every year to the poorest children of the world. Is it because you are afraid to be seen as being 'silly' or too 'socialist' or 'soft hearted' or because the system demands that you pay attention to the important things of life like obeying your bosses and keeping order and besides, ""What can a lowly person like myself do about the situation"" and you're too busy speculating on what the real estate market will be doing in the coming months and finding a pair of jeans at Jeans West which will fit.....Michael meets Hanna when he is fifteen. Unbeknownst to Michael, he is coming down with scarlet fever. He is throwing up in an alley on a very rainy day when Hanna, the tram conductor, stops to offer him a warm place to rest until he feels better. Hanna also cleans up his vomit from the pavement. Hanna believes in orderliness and cleanliness. This penchant for order is apparent from the beginning of their relationship and these traits lead her to offer Michael baths and to bathe herself as well and as the movie progresses the motherly Hanna and her son-like friend begin to explore the attractions which flow from such erotic circumstances.Both Hanna and Michael are full of hidden passions. Michael could have been a Heydrich in Prague, had he been born 15 years earlier. He is clearly 'officer material'. Hanna, on the other hand, is a working class woman born 30 years earlier into a society which would tell women that their highest aspirations could be fulfilled by staying in the kitchen with the children when they weren't engaged in taking in a church service. with the family. Education was unnecessary. Both Hanna and Michael are intelligent and attractive. Both are turned on by the doors which are opened to them by great literature. Both are also social products of their own German culture, with its various and sundry facets of puritanical, psychological repression, including a kind of reserve which leads to the peculiarly German goodness of keeping one's mouth shut in public about things political, things which the authorities have well in hand. Hanna's fear of exposing her own illiteracy and Michael's fear of public condemnation as a young law student at speaking up for Hanna in a court of law are the stuff of tragedy. Sound familiar? Even after many steamy sexual encounters, Hanna is shocked by passages in D.H. Lawrence's LADY CHATTERLY'S LOVER, telling Michael that it is the equivalent of smut and that he should stop reading from it, almost as his mother would have. But clearly, Michael is not attracted to Hanna because she is a mother replica--Oedipus, no. One has only to compare and contrast Michael's screen mother with Kate Winslett's Hanna to know that.However, it is 'klip und klar' that Hanna loves Michael and he loves her but, unbeknownst to them both when they are together, their love runs very, very deeply. They might believe that they will get over their summertime romance as time goes by, but the reality is that such love does not die, no matter what happens: there are no conditions for it.There are elements of Fassbinder's ""Ali, Fear Eats the Heart"" and ""Berlin Alexanderplatz"" in ""The Reader"". ""Sophie's Choice"" also comes to mind. See this movie and be prepared to cry for humanity because as Thoreau observed, """"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with the song still in them."" Methnks this is especially so in cultures as deeply built on the authoritarian personality character structure as the German one is.",1
"In 1995, a German man reminisces about a relationship he had, as a teenager, in 1958 with an older woman. He also remembers what happened subsequent to that, including her standing trial for war crimes committed during World War 2, and the secret which denied her justice...Excellent movie. Searingly emotional with an original, intriguing and thought-provoking plot. Direction is spot-on. Pacing is perfect.Kate Winslet is mind-bogglingly brilliant in the lead role and well deserved her Best Leading Actress Oscar. Ralph Fiennes puts in his usual solid performance. The revelation though is David Kross, who brings a maturity beyond his years.A must-see movie, and an instant classic.",1
"The story is a simple one, with a twist. A boy has an affair with an older woman, who one day abandons him without a word. A quiet, sensitive boy, in post WW2 Germany. Finding him retching outside her house she takes him in and cleans him up. When he recuperates and comes to thank her, the relationship becomes kinetic.He is educated, she is not. He is innocent, she is not. They make a trade. If he'll read his books of literature to her, she'll please him sexually. He learns little of her, and she doesn't offer much to him, except her body. When he pleads for more, she berates him with: ""you mean nothing to me."" It is a prophetic remark that shows us more of her, but little else is forthcoming, and when he hesitantly asks her if she means it, she seems to grudgingly back down. As it turns out this exchange may be crucial for the boy's, and our understanding of her character.A few years later, when attending a war crimes trial for a class, he is stunned to see his former lover as one of those accused. She was a guard at Auschwitz. The young man is devastated, but holds his silence to his friends. He decides to visit her in jail but backs out. Then he realizes that he has evidence that can change the course of her trial, but continues to keep silent.It is his silence that makes up the core of this movie, and it is it's unraveling that is left to the audience. Is his reason simple or complex? Is he acting out of cowardice, malice, or a sense of justice? As a man (Ralph Fiennes) he one day decides to send her one of the books he used to read to her. But not the book, rather a tape he has made of himself reading the book. He had realized in the trial that the one thing he knew about her, was the one thing that might have given her a more lenient sentence: she is illiterate. How this could have been a mitigating factor I won't divulge.Using his tapes and looking at the books she teaches herself to read, and starts to write to him, but he never responds, continuing his silence, and yet continuing to correspond to her as a ""Reader."" What are we to make of him? Or her? My take on it, is that she was a simple, concrete soul, used to taking orders, and able to separate herself emotionally from her job, yet remaining shallow in spite of all the fine literature she is exposed to. She ends up being able to read, but never able to fathom. She comes across not as callous, but as vapid.He on the other hand comes across as a weak man, unable to grapple with the paradox of loving a ""monster,"" who he never knew as a monster. Unable to offer much except that which he can do at a distance. He is not callous, but is, like his erstwhile lover, emotionally hollow.Winslett is haunting, and emanates pathos. The boy David Kross is winning as a winsome lad. All in all the movie held up well and was engrossing, but I could have done without the final scene with Lena Olin, who plays a victim of the holocaust, imperiously, and unsympathetically, and the scene seems to have had only one purpose: to allow her to get in the pregnant line: ""you can learn nothing from the camps.""",1
"The Reader is full of interesting ideas, but it suffers from lacklustre execution.The central question at the heart of the story is whether or not we'll ever be able to distance ourselves enough from the Holocaust to understand how it was allowed to happen. Categorizing every person who played a role in it as a monster is easy and it provides an emotional catharsis, but it also prevents us from learning from history. After all, not every person who worked in a concentration camp was evil -- many of them were just people doing their jobs without any of the historical context we now have. And if we disregard them as something inhuman, we won't be able to know how to prevent something similar from happening again.This question plays out in the story of Hannah, a former concentration camp guard (played by Kate Winslet), and Michael, played as a young man by David Kross and as an older man by Ralph Fiennes. Hannah and David have an affair before David knows of Hannah's past, and comes across her again years later when he's a law student and she's on trial as a war criminal. David must reconcile his loathing of what Hannah did with the fact that he knows she's not a monster. Hannah's real shame are not her crimes, but rather the fact that she never learned to read, and the film's best moments come in the third act when Michael, as a way of expiating some of the guilt he feels at not coming to Hannah's defense when he knew information that would have helped her case, records himself reading some of Hannah's favorite stories and sends them to her in prison.""The Reader"" is a solid piece of film-making, but it has that ever-so-slightly-embalmed quality that comes when a director and writer feel the need to be too respectful to the source material. It's sombre and tactful and always feels more like a filmed book than a movie. It never comes cinematically alive. It boasts good performances, especially from Winslet and Lena Olin, who has brief dual roles as mother and daughter concentration camp survivors. And it has one all-too-brief thrilling sequence in which Winslet's character decides to spend her time in prison learning to read -- just watch Winslet's face as Hannah recognizes the word ""the"" for the first time. Otherwise, it's the kind of movie to admire rather than fall in love with.Grade: B+",1
"Here we have one of the best films of the last decade. A war film that succeeds in showing what it's like to be in the armed forces nowadays. It was directed be the underrated Kathryn Bigelow. The focus is on American soldiers in the Iraq war. But it's not about them being involved in assaults or shootouts. Instead we're shown the lives of a bomb squad. Jeremy Renner is commanding as Sergeant First Class William James. He provides an excellent performance. So do Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty as his partners. They really do act like real soldiers. The Hurt Locker consists of a series of bomb threats that the team have to overcome. These are all thrilling, tense. What makes the film really shine, however, is its anti-war messages. In the tradition of Apocalypse Now (1979) and Come And See (1985) The Hurt Locker shows that people get hurt and killed in wars, even if they don't deserve it. It shows that the victims are just like anyone else except that they're in a war zone. The film doesn't directly criticize the American war effort. There are no discussions about whether the Iraq war is moral or immoral. Bigelow's direction is truly impressive. She certainly knows how to work with actors. The acting is obviously superb, and this is the film's greatest strength. Also notable is the cinematography by Barry Ackroyd. The war hasn't looked this realistic or this interesting in cinema until The Hurt Locker. The images captured are thoughtful and memorable. No wonder the film was the big winner at the 2010 Academy Awards. Some films that win Best Picture don't deserve it, but The Hurt Locker sure did deserve it. It's one of the best war films ever, and I highly recommend it.",1
"Except for the first few minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" no film I've ever seen comes closer than ""The Hurt Locker"" to portraying the randomness, senselessness, brutality and -- yes -- the excitement of battle. With the exception of Ralph Fiennes who makes a brief appearance early in the movie, there are no stars and few recognizable actors in this story about a small group of men whose mission is to defuse improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Iraq. Frequently under surveillance, though not always certain whether it is by curious bystanders or enemies in civilian clothing, these men are at risk every moment they are in the field.The principal character, Sgt. First Class William James (Jeremy Renner) is one of those who seem to get an adrenaline rush in the face of danger. His colleagues, Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackle) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geaghty), see no glamor in their task. Sanborn is a workman-like soldier, trying to do his duty in as safe a manner as possible. Eldridge is in a near-constant state of panic, eager to be somewhere else, any place else. They are not presented as stereotypes, however, nor is anyone else in this absorbing movie. Everyone in the field knows he may die at any moment, and how they manage to hold up in the searing heat of Iraq in a war they aren't asked to understand may be the main point of this film, if indeed it has any point other than War is Hell and the Iraqi War is a particularly terrible slice of Hell.Kathryn Bigelow deserves every award she won for ""The Hurt Locker."" It is completely unsentimentalized. There is no moral drawn, except what the viewer concludes based on the judgments he or she brought to the movie and the impact of the story on those judgments. Of its type, it is far and away the best war movie I've ever seen.",1
"I am truly sadden that this film got bashed so much. I hear reviews saying this film ""sucks"" or it has too many inaccuracies. Movies like Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List have also ""some"" inaccuracies in them. (They are Masterpieces) It is pretty sad this film has been getting this bashed. It doesn't deserve to be.The Hurt Locker is full of suspense and is directed beautifully by Kathryn Bigelow. I'd have to say this is movie truly captures the Iraq War. What a dangerous war it was for our soldiers. This movie shows us what our soldiers went through. This isn't bashing the American soldiers at all or even War. It gives us a great deal of appreciation for our troops who are risking their lives every single day for Us, Freedom and the U.S.A.The true purpose of this movie is to not just praise the soldiers. But for one of the military's unrecognized heroes which are the technicians of the bombs squads who risk their lives to save others. This is the purpose of the movie to let everyone know what these people do.This time and I know all of you out there, don't want to hear it, the critics are actually right. This movie is fantastically directed by Kathryn Bigelow and she rightfully deserved her Oscar for best director.I know many Avatar fans out there probably rated this movie a 1, without even seeing it because it won Best Picture and Avatar didn't. This movie seems its suffering from the curse of Best Picture. More people have watched Avatar than the Hurt Locker. So of course this film has gotten bashed by so many. I think SOME of the bad reviews are the Avatar Fanboys who are just angry Avatar didn't win Best Picture.Please don't just go along with the bad reviews this film has gotten from IMDb. Just try and watch this film.The Hurt Locker is a war epic, that I hope it becomes appreciative as time passes. 9/10 Highly recommended.",1
"Already celebrated for its breathtaking realism in depicting soldiers and explosions, The Hurt Locker is being called ""the best Iraq war movie,"" with the qualification that the genre has been weak and the public response weaker. This is Kathryn Bigelow all right: macho men in dazzling exploits, exhilarating and always a little terrifying to watch, with adrenalin and testosterone spurting off the screen. If war is a drug, this movie could give you a contact high. Bigelow was obviously born to make a war movie. The only question is why she took this long to do so. Writer Mark Boal led her into it. He embedded with a bomb squad in Iraq, and came back with remarkable stories and a character to hold them together. He's Staff Sergeant William James, who's what in the genteel days of The English Patient was more commonly called a ""sapper,"" a combat engineer who specializes in demolitions, minefields, and the like. Bigelow wisely chose Jeremy Renner, an unknown and unglamorous actor, for this pleasingly enigmatic role of a man who may be closer to bombs and timers than to his own comrades.The Hurt Locker (soldier slang for a real bad place) gives you immediacy and vérité soldier life, with the shaky digital camera and in-and-out zooms of the genre (the action is so good, we soon forget them, while in Brian De Palms's crude 2007 Redacted, they grate all through). Such authenticity is achieved in Brit documentary filmmaker Nick Broomfield's more political, excellent, little seen, low-budget 2005 drama The Battle for Haditha. It may not make his film unbiased, but Broomfield most notably gives more detail of the Iraqi P.O.V. -- using real Iraqis -- while Bigelow sticks to showing Iraqis as the American soldiers experience them -- an experience that turns out to be insane, paranoia-inducing, and scary. (In both movies one of the few friendly forms of contact is buying and selling pirated DVD's, the US soldiers buying, the Iraqis selling, and in both this contact becomes a key plot element.) Obviously Bigelow also had a much bigger budget, the better to provide a wealth of spectacular explosions, essential (or justified anyway) since this is about a small team of three men whose main (but by no means only) job is to find and defuse improvised explosive devices (IED's), the DIY but sometimes highly ingenious signature weapons of the Iraqi insurgency. There is also a horrifying body bomb; a complicated and lethal car bomb in front of a UN building; a suicide bomber who has a change of heart (as in Hany Abu-Assad's 2005 Paradise Now); and a hairy firefight with snipers (and a somewhat obtrusive cameo by Ralph Fiennes) out in the desert. Besides which the adrenalin-numbed Sergeant James independently gets himself and his two squad members, Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), into various private and probably unnecessary severe crap storms. All of this is staged with stunning accomplishment and a strong focus on character and the interactions, intense even when alienated, of these three men.The movie takes no political stand, other than Hedges' ""war is a drug."" This is like the point of view of Andrew Swoford used for Sam Mendes' 2005 Jarhead, which, however unsuccessful in some aspects and poorly received, conveys that soldiers don't question war because they're too busy doing dangerous jobs, or waiting and hoping to do them, and trying to stay alive till, God willing, their tour ends.The Hurt Locker is episodic and cyclical. It ends where it begins, with the protagonist joining a new team of strangers for another tour. Thanks to Boal's writing, Bigelow's fine directing, and an excellent cast, the episodes never seem routine or repetitive. But if you emerge with a sense of numbing danger and pointlessness that may not be inappropriate. The only structure is the routine one of datelines saying how many days are left in Bravo company's tour. But this is a figure that, as Kimberly Peirce's Stop-Loss depicts, is often set back to start again.The opening sequence, where James's predecessor is killed, leaving Eldridge and Sanborn in need of a new leader, is pretty obvious. It's so carefully set up you know what will happen. It's still excruciatingly tense, a textbook street IED diffusion job that conveys how terrified the two backup guys are and sets up what's to come. This is a team, with all three in radio contact and each with his function, Eldridge the lookout in charge of Sanborn, who's the guard. The street is surrounded with buildings and people and deep in unknowns. When James arrives shortly after his predecessor's body has been shipped home, he does a similar job, but it's all different.First we don't feel the danger except by remembering the first sequence, because James is so immune to it. Sanborn and Eldridge are freaking out because James doesn't stay in touch with him when he's suited up dealing with the device. They feel lost. We realize that the three before were a great team and we sense the rage and abandonment of his bereaved mates. There's immediate intense conflict between Eldridge, an elegant, chiseled black man with extensive Intelligence experience, and the puffy-cheeked James whom Eldridge calls ""redneck trailer trash"" straight off to his face. These telegraphed macho conflicts, essential Bigelow, work because the jobs being done are all so convincingly and intensely depicted.This is a great movie but it leaves you empty. The director is so caught up in what she's doing that it's infectious, but the compelling intensity also represents a loss of perspective. Still, if there is any non-documentary Iraq war movie that's a must-see, this has got to be it, and it's by far the best thing the uneven but gifted Kathryn Bigelow has ever done. It's a game-changer, the new American war movie to beat.(This is a cut version of a 1,600-word review.)",1
"I love a good war film and I fall into the ""been there, done that"" category. So I would like to think my review is an accurate one (IMHO). Having just watched this film on DVD I can safely say that it was a pile of rubbish. There is no way I can recommend this film to you.It started off with me shouting at the TV saying ""you wouldn't do that"" etc...but I soon realised that having a bit of job experience would be a hindrance so I chilled a bit. But on the opening scene when the trailer wheel fell off I got a nasty feeling that this film would be a predictable dud...I was right.There simply wasn't any logic to the EOD scenes. I just know that the army team had some of the most patient insurgents ever at the other end of the command wire or remote trigger. So much so I was left scratching my head all the time. Then just when you think you know where the story is going the guys in the Humvee are off out on their own driving around the desert. One of the most valuable assets in theatre out on a jolly bumping into some SAS wannabe contractors.The sniper scene was just so laughable. It just made no sense at all and made me want to switch off there and then. Then for them to drag it out so long really did test my patience.It started with the ""Contact Right"" and went down hill fast. If you had a Brit accent then you got shot but if you were part of the EOD team then suddenly you were a great shot and saved the day. Then just as you thought it was over it stretched on for an inexplicably long period without adding anything to the story at all. You are just left watching and asking why hasn't it ended yet?Then we had the booze scene where they just hit each other for a laugh..another scene where you just wanted it to end. It added nothing to the film.Then just as my life seemed very dull the main star went outside the wire to hunt someone down. This most be the most ridiculous scene I have ever watched. It defied all logic and ability to write a good storyline...it was senseless and awful. I still don't understand why they wasted time on it. Then to watch him just jog through the busy streets heading back to camp had me rolling on the floor with laughter. Pure comedy :)The sad fact is that this storyline is all over the show without really deciding what it wants to be. I thought it was going to be stupid illogical EOD scenes but then it kept going off on tangents trying to be something different. But as hard as it tried it just bored me to death. All I wanted was for it to end. It was a messy compilation of stupid scenes mixed into a batch of stupid, senseless, action(ish) scenes.There is no way I can recommend this. Maybe my work experience compromised the enjoyability but even the naive must realise this just doesn't make sense. The only thing more stupid than this film is the artificially high IMDb rating...which must be the 24/7 work of the box office PR team who seem to use this website as a way of making everyone think it is good. Sorry folks...it just ain't!Not recommended...it will just bore you.",1
"The Hurt Locker is a serious character study and a taut, suspenseful action thriller at once.The subject matter itself - the work of a bomb expert, possibly one of the most nerve-racking jobs on the planet - yields most of the suspense but Bigelow manages to squeeze out every bit of tension of the premise.This film to me was very apolitical - though set in Iraq, it is distinguished from most of the Iraq-themed war films in that it concentrates much more on the job itself than the political environment. Iraq seemed more like a backdrop - any other war would do, The Hurt Locker does not preach about this one specifically.The story is deeply emotional, depicting a thoroughly disturbed individual's life in hell. Jeremy Renner gives an incredibly powerful performance as an EOD officer completely hooked on adrenaline stemming from his everyday close shaves with death.All aspects of film-making are top-notch, from the brilliantly subversive screenplay through vivid cinematography, masterful directing and perfectly paced editing.In its storytelling the filmmakers wisely break with traditional Hollywood narrative techniques. There is no clear antagonist, no rising action, no obvious character development and no climax. And yet the film manages to be more interesting, tense and suspenseful than any Hollywood action thriller I've seen in years while making a powerful, yet subtle statement about the insane addiction that is war. Kudos for everyone involved for making this film without compromising.This is pure quality, cinematic storytelling at its best, a thinking man's actioner.",1
"Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) is the ""wild man"" team leader who has defused more than eight hundred bombs and has built his reputation on being an adrenaline junkie in order to mask his inability to cope with the emotional connections he feebly tries to make at home and on the job. Sergeant JT Sandborn (Anthony Mackie) approaches his work with a by-the-book stoicism that can't comprehend the recklessness of James. Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) is highly trained but still feels overwhelmed by his morbid thoughts on war and his role in it. These are the members of the EOD Army bomb squad stationed in Baghdad in 2004, and ""The Hurt Locker"" is their story.After failing to do so with the depressingly somber and serious ""In The Valley of Elah"", screenwriter Mark Boal wisely places politics and moralizing aside this time to give us an intimate look into one squad with a highly specialized job to do. Hollywood has always loved to play with the grunt's-eye-view-of-war-as-hell theme, but ""The Hurt Locker"" spins that volatile cocktail on its head and blows it up all over the screen by focusing on an elite team and proposes the notion that maybe war is a drug...for some.Director Kathryn Bigelow hits all the right detonators with her fascinating presentation of modern warfare in the Middle East. Bigelow hasn't really made anything memorable since her 1987 breakthrough, the cult vampire/western ""Near Dark"", but she has always managed to make interesting failures-- just take a look at her attempt to do a literary adaptation with the superficially obtuse ""The Weight of Water"". Often living under the shadow of ex-husband James Cameron or having to share the title of ""that female action director"" with Mimi Leder (until Mimi murdered her film career with the abominable ""Pay it Forward"") Bigelow, determined to finally leave her mark, displays an astounding technical prowess with ""The Hurt Locker"" that can only come from the wisdom of experience. Close-ups, slow-mo's, quick cuts and inventive plays with the camera's point-of-view are used sparingly and with pin-point precision to heighten tension. Here she shows the ""good ol' boys"" she once emulated but has now trounced that style can be used for dramatic effect but need not be excessive. Her sense of space allows us to be right there with the bomb squad as they are faced with unimaginable danger. We always know where each character is positioned in relation to the bomb, and we always find in turn our stomachs have hit the floor. Her technique is brilliant and delivers a picture that is so taut it might be the most intense experience this side of Clouzot's ""Wages of Fear"". Now knowing all the moves, however, I wonder how the film will hold up on return viewing.""The Hurt Locker"" is not for those seeking generic thrills or anyone currently on medication for emotional problems. It gets deep down into the gritty nature of bomb defusing by offering us lessons on suicide bombers, IED's and body-bombs that will make your gut churn. There's also some fantastically rendered sniper scenarios that are used not just for a visceral jolt, but also as a way to explore character development. Soldiers are not only put in precarious situations during combat but also in their day-to-day life dealing with their own conflicted emotions on top of a moody Iraqi populace that includes people treating them as tourists and looking to make a quick buck, people looking at the carnage as a spectator sport, people suffering as innocent bystanders, and people who wish to kill the soldiers and any one else in any way possible.While there are a few details one could quibble with (for instance, the title is never explained), ""The Hurt Locker"" is impossible to dismiss and sometimes hard to digest. It paints a picture of war that shows there are no politics when it comes to the daily experiences of soldiers in the field. Their everyday heroism is painted in varying shades of moral ambiguity, while their internal struggles are shown to receive no emotional closure. As in real life, the story arcs of the fictional characters seen here are left open-ended, and the possibility of redeployment looms not just as an act of cruel fate but as a conscious and determined choice.",1
"I was always under the impression that it would be another liberal propaganda-driven message movie like all the others coming out recently. To my great surprise, it was not. Rather than use the war to tell people already against it to protest, Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal decide to use Iraq purely as a backdrop to the real subject matter at hand—war itself. Plain and simple, war is hell, but it is also a drug each soldier feeds on, an adrenaline rush that makes him wake every morning to see what may happen. We are thrown into the action as Bravo Company's bomb team has just 38 days left in rotation. Let's just say the day doesn't end well and the final month has its ups and downs showing the world what is going on over there—the pressure, the friendships, the duty, and the loss.The authenticity is astounding throughout. I know people will gripe about the shaky camera style, but that lends itself to the realism and puts you into the action of this bomb squad under the cowboy antics of leader William James, played by Jeremy Renner. He is a recent addition, replacing the team's last technician after a tragic accident involving a bomb and an Iraqi cell phone. It would appear that he has a death wish, going into situations without recon and letting his emotions get the better of him every step of the way. He does have a girlfriend and son back home, though, and the compassion a father has comes out at times, especially when dealing with a young Middle Eastern boy named Beckham selling DVDs and playing soccer. James uses his sense of humor strangely, telling people he'll chop their heads off or some other such nonsense with a straight face before smiling, saying he's just kidding, and rubbing their head. His carefree attitude may seem cavalier, but by the end of the film we will realize what makes him tick. He is doing this for his country, filling a job in high demand with the US army, a job he's damn good at.The other two members of his team don't necessarily share his laidback demeanor. As another soldier says later on in the film, this team is wired tight. Anthony Mackie's JT Sanborn is a by-the-books guy, holding the safety of his men above all else. He is willing to have a good time and can drink, punch, and joke with the best of them, but when it comes to a live bomb out in the middle of a street, he wants you with your radio on, listening to what he has to say. When a surrounding area has been evacuated and he asks James to pull back, letting the engineers take over, he wants to be listened to. Renner's technician is not that kind of guy, though. He sees a puzzle and he wants to solve it, almost admiring the bomb creator whose work he is dismantling. Unafraid to give his Sergeant the finger and continue with his work, headphones and bomb suit off—Specialist Eldridge right next to him in the blast zone being told to fall back by Sanborn but having to stay since James is the commanding officer—he lives for the excitement at the edge of life and death.As for Eldridge, played by Brian Geraghty, who is used to the desert having been in Jarhead, he is a young novice on the team, never having seen a dead body, never having been in a firefight, and yet here he is putting himself in the way of active bombs that could blow him to pieces. A boy that isn't quite able to shake the fear of death, nor the thought that being in Iraq means he already is dead, Eldridge is visited often by a Colonel, who is also a psychiatrist of some sort, helping him through the war. Their relationship ends with devastating effect that resonates from Geraghty's performance despite being an obvious result when watching the sequence leading up to the event. It really is the performance by each of these three leads—Renner, Mackie, and Geraghty—that makes The Hurt Locker as effective a tale as it is. Eldridge may keep his demons on his sleeve throughout, but both James and Sanborn keep theirs hidden until they can no longer. Both do brilliant work at expressing the inner fears and desires, especially those dreams they aren't sure they'll ever be able to fulfill.A lot of credit must be given to Bigelow for getting all the pieces together and crafting a very effective war film. It is character-driven throughout, hinging on the audience believing that these men are in life or death situations each and every day. She opens the film through the eyes of an Army bot, calling to memory the first person filming in—what is my favorite film of hers—Strange Days. And while many will label Bigelow as a man's director, doing action and testosterone-induced work, you can't deny her delicate care in expressing the human psyche. It isn't even just the fight scenes or the high-pressure anticipation of a bomb going off; no my favorite moment is when Renner goes off camp to seek revenge for something he believes occurred. He is alone, without his uniform or equipment and only a sidearm at his disposal, wandering the streets of Iraq. Just the matter in which he has to return to base shows how on edge everyone is. This isn't a video game played by faceless automatons, no, war is most definitely hell. It's being fought, win or lose, by people just like us, full of aspirations and dreams we just hope we'll live long enough to see come to fruition.",1
"When a movie as seriously flawed as this one wins, you know the integrity of the Oscars is dead. Dead.Bad script. Bad character development. Totally ridiculous plot lines worthy of a B movie. Artificially drawn out encounters with suspicious people to ramp up tension. Repeated ad nauseum.Silly.The three soldiers depicted in this movie: One adrenalin junkie nut case, one uptight control freak, and one clueless junior team member caught between the first two. They're unrealistically isolated from the rest of the Army and seem to define and riff their own missions, completely detached from any type of command structure that everyone else in the military deals with. I think there are two officers in the entire movie, both colonels: One gung-ho Rambo type, the other a genteel psychologist, who practically wears a sign on his back: ""I'm a hopeless stereotype, please martyr me somewhere in the middle of the movie."" Otherwise, I guess the Army forget to deploy any lieutenants or captains to Iraq, because the bomb squad didn't seem to be taking orders from anyone.On and on it goes, one implausible situation after another. The more I reflect on this movie, the more I dislike it, and the more upsetting it is that the movie received the most prestigious award Hollywood gives itself.",1
"American soldiers in Iraq defuse explosives while dodging sniper fire. Lather. Rinse. Repeat. And so it goes on and on and on for a mind-numbing 13 hours or so. The central character is an arrogant jerk; the other characters are stereotypes from central casting. There is no plot - just random encounters with insurgents. The most annoying aspect is the camera work. There's a scene in this film where the hero complains about the shaky camera work in an adult DVD he has purchased. Well, if he could step back he would notice that the film he's in is all shaky camera work and incessant zooming. It's nauseating. Somebody please take away Bigelow's camera. She is a clueless hack.",1
"i was intrigued to see how a little-seen 2008 film had somehow won the Oscar for best picture of 2009 and thus went to see The Hurt Locker. sadly, all i got for the two hours invested was the grim confirmation that this film had won awards purely for off-the-screen reasons.the direction and visual style of this film is some of the weakest you will ever see. when it's not busy being yet another Bourne Identity homage with dire, annoying ""shaky cam"" visuals, it shows off all the hallmarks of a second rate daytime soap opera in terms of lensing.the ""plot"" is threadbare, the characterizations are about as well developed as rejected Beetle Bailey comic strip ideas and the dialogue - on the instances where the film gives up on being ""minimalist"" and for no apparent reason turns one or two soldiers into right chatterboxes - is some of the worst ever recorded. in fairness, the actors do the best they can in the circumstances, just not enough to obscure how bad the project is.the whole film has the feel of it being intended as some kind of ""mockumentary"" that they clocked was bereft of humour and thus re-edited as best they could so as to pass it off as a serious drama.if you spend two hours on this film they are two hours you will never get back, and two hours wasted that you will regret for the rest of your life.",1
"This is a tough one. How do I review this movie? Is it an action flick? Is it a war flick? Or is the Hurt Locker a social comment on the Iraq experience?While some will claim the movie is all three of those things, I personally don't know the answer and after watching the Hurt Locker I'm quite sure neither does director Kathryn Bigelow.The Hurt Locker is a movie full of all the right intentions, a lot of competent actors, and many many camera setups. But there is not one powerful scene, not one notable performance and not a single memorable image for all its two hours of run time.We follow a group of U.S. Soldiers, but it feels like they are the only group in all of Baghdad. Intentional or budgetary restraints? We roam the anarchic streets of Baghdad (which, credit to the filmmakers, actually feels like a real Arab country. And after seeing the movie, I learned they went all the way to Jordan. Bravo, as the setting actually feels authentic.) We disarm a lot of bombs and enter many uncertain doorways. While the movie aims to be exciting, I just couldn't ""suspend disbelief"" when the director is trying so hard to be realistic by shaking the camera so much. And why can't a troupe of former British SAS officers handle a handful of insurgents in an empty cinder block shed. I call shenanigans.OK I understand the idea of dramatic license, but there is no way a former SAS sharpshooter is going to miss a shot, die from a window sniper half a mile away and an American G.I. will save the day taking over on the guy's Barrett .50 cal.. I'm not putting anybody down here, but I would bet most people with some sort of know will be with me in saying ""Yeah Right."" This scene is a poster child for the movie at large - like most of the movie, makes little sense and very little is rooted in any sort of reality. But the camera shakes so its oh so real! Quite frankly I laughed my butt off in the sequence.Dude, she made Point Break...POINT BREAK! How could you expect any different? If you haven't figured it out by this point, Kathryn Bigelow isn't going into the books as one of the greats. From what I read, the crew shot endless setups to get a ""documentary feel."" Well as a documentary photographer I can tell you, to document something, you only really need one camera. The rest depends on vision. Something Kathryn Bigelow doesn't have.The script is laughable, the characters forgettable, and the direction completely platitudinous, the only Hurt Locker is the seat you're stuck in until this turkey plays itself out.",1
"Kathryn Bigelow concocts a masterpiece of a film without tricks or gimmicks, at least none to be detected and that in itself is a triumph. Realistic yet poetic like the works of the great masters. It enters and fits a genre and at the same time is unique, unexpected. It shutters, moves and alters every sense, like a powerful drug. I saw it last night and I'm going to see it again tonight. Last night Jeremy Remmer came to speak to the audience in a face to face moderated by Sam Rockwell, great idea but it change my perception of Remmer in the film, of his character. Although he praised Kathryn Bigelow, he said things like ""I don't tell her how to direct and she doesn't tell me how to act"" Watching the film I felt that childish arrogance belonged to the character by his personal appearance showed it belonged to the actor. In any case, it works on the screen. A character you warm up to almost immediately in spite of his contradictions. Remmer will remind you at times of Robert Redford and others of Michael J Pollard. He is truly terrific so try to avoid his personal appearances not to contaminate that impression. The rest of the cast works wonders and the brief cameos by Guy Pearce and Ralph Finnes are the most organic and unobtrusive cameos I've ever seen in my life. All in all extraordinary. I predict, even if we're only in June, that Kathryn Bigelow risks to be the first female director to win the Academy Award. She certainly got my vote.",1
"I spent the entire film grabbing the arms of my seat. I was there in Irak, steps away from my death and the death of those around me. The tension, the suspense is at times breathtaking, literally. ""The Hurt Locker"" is a miracle and the definitive consecration of a great filmmaker, Kathryn Bigelow. This is also a rare occasion in which I went to see the film without having read a single review or knowing anything about it. One should try to do that more often because the impact of the surprise translates into pure pleasure and in this case, sometimes, you have to look away from the unmitigated horror. Jeremy Renner is a real find. He is superb. A kind soul, wild man with enough arrogance to make him appear reckless and yet his humanity precedes him. People may commit the mistake of avoiding this gem thinking that it's just a war film. Don't. It isn't. It's a great, engrossing film about human emotions, not to be missed.",1
"I have read a lot of criticism from soldiers. I'm not an solider but I have some knowledge of military tactics and some common sense too. The movie is ""disconnected and detached"" as some may say. It is more collection of action scenes than story that has real sense, there is very little psychology, some bizarre lines. But it is incredibly illogical. For example the ""sniper scene"": Insurgents are hidden in the house. You are on top of the ridge. This is bad spot of course and the first US guy gets killed. The other takes the same gun on the same place and STAYS here for hours. This is very bad decision of course! The ridge is on the east, the house is on the west. You stay on the ridge until the sunset - sun shines directly into you face which means you cannot see anything but the insurgents must see reflection of your scope lens very clearly. This is very strange. In another scene you see team of three pyrotechnics searching building which has only recently been abandoned by insurgents - very dangerous! In later scene these three guys try to find insurgents in the buildings during the night - they even SPLIT and try to find them INDEPENDENTLY. This is not only risky, this is just plain stupid. Stupid. I just don't believe that US soldiers are so dumb and so badly trained. The script is unbelievable, pure B to C grade! I have no idea how this crap won so many Oscars - is it because of its ""anti war ideology""? I have been very disappointed by this movie.",1
"Technically, there's nothing wrong with this movie. But nothing spectacular either, I might add.I have no particular views on ""The Hurt Locker"" winning the Academy Award for Best Movie, considering that 2009 was a spectacularly dull movie going year (don't even get me started with Pocahontas-cum-Smurfs!)This movie hides behind a thin veneer of ""war is hell"", but never for one second - like most American war movies - veer from the ""support the troops"" discourse (in fact, the people in the US armed forces are described as ""superheroes"" in the supplemental material on the DVD). Although war might be hell, we always are supposed to sympathize with those (supposedly) brave and gallant men and women who are fighting it, never portraying them in a negative way, or even delivering the slightest criticism towards the actions of US troops.This, of course, is true of most movies claiming to be anti war. Those who dare step outside the propagandist ""support the troops"" framework and deal with the atrocities perpetrated by US soldiers are punished by being accused of treason (like Brian De Palma who did ""Redacted"", a fictionalized account about the Mahmudiyah killings, where an entire Iraqi family was murdered and a 14 year old girl gang raped and murdered by US troops) or punished economically (like Nick Broomfield's ""Battle for Haditha"", a movie about the massacre where 24 civilians where massacred in their homes by US troops, being shown in one single theater, raking in a whopping 10,000 dollars in its theatrical run).Whenever someone from the US military is a bad guy in a movie, it's always some rogue element - never that the military in itself is bad and commits atrocities directed towards civilians on a regular basis. This criticism isn't limited to movies dealing with the Iraq war and subsequent occupation, but it's valid for just about any military conflict in which the US armed forces are engaged. And of course there are examples like ""The Rock"" where the military bad guys really turn out to be good at heart, fighting for their brethren who have been betrayed by the government (it's funny how movies are critical towards some nondescript behemoth ""government"", but are silent when it comes to the armed wing of the same).In ""The Hurt Locker"" the US troops might as well have been wearing white hats, and all the cardboard cutout Iraqis black hats, because this movie is about as multidimensional as an old western when it comes to good guys and bad guys. In this movie Iraqis fulfill the same function as the Somalis in ""Black Hawk Down"" - a faceless crowd of bad guys ready to be gunned down in scores (except for one token character; most likely a result of liberal guilt).In the DVD extras, Bigelow claims to want to ""put the audience into the soldier's shoes"". Her lack of interest in the plight of the Iraqis under occupation is blatantly obvious. In fact (if memory serves me right), all violence directed towards Iraqi civilians is perpetrated by other Iraqis. The US soldiers are just there to protect Iraqis. The movie is well in line with the talking points of the US regime (it doesn't matter if it's run by Republicans or Democrats - same sh*t, different suit).This movie is just another example of a cowardly movie industry, resulting in a film which is anti war in name only. Always a good way of getting movie going liberals to ease their guilt.",1
"War movies have never been my cup of tea, but I decided to give 'The Hurt Locker' a shot (after enormously high ratings and after watching the horrid 'Stop-Loss.') I wasn't disappointed. It had excellent acting – Renner should be nominated for an Oscar, completely believable surroundings, sounds and action and mostly, it was on-the-edge suspenseful. Granted, 1-2 deaths were absolutely predictable (the one in the beginning was such a set up, I unfortunately thought of 'Cliffhanger's opening,) the rest of the solders, you have no idea if they'll live or die, and that's the point of this movie/war. I truly felt as if I was there, and sadly, I had to compare this to my own job that I don't particularly care for. The obvious ""Okay, I guess my job/life ain't that bad"" thoughts surfaced. We have a ('Lethal Weapon's Martin Riggs) newcomer/replacement (Renner) after the previously mentioned death of a bomb expert dies. His cowboy, caution-to-the-wind attitude not only upsets his comrades, they want to put an end to it. All the while they spend most of their time deciphering between who's a friendly and who's an insurgent. I don't think any recent war movie I've seen truly made me feel even more respect (although, I felt I already had the highest respect for the U.S. armed forces) and more gratitude that I live in a country so completely unlike any Middle Eastern country. Definitively see 'Locker.' Despite the hate it shows humans show other humans, it really makes you appreciate life all the more. Side note: coincidentally enough, both 'Stop-Loss' and 'Locker' were both modern-war films, directed by women and showed a true enemy: man. However, while you can take 'Locker' serious and learn something from it, the same can't be said by the ""MTV Movie""/music video 'Loss.'",1
"Well, here's my vote for what might turn out to be the best war or war related film so far this century. If you seek an Afhganistan experience that humanizes the 'war effort' and its suburban impact there and here, THE HURT LOCKER is it. Jeremy Renner is a strange new-ish actor, I have never seen him before but felt as though I had. He reminds me of Daniel Craig. Or maybe Craig's younger brother. I see today that Renner in in the running to play Max Rockatansky in MAD MAX 4 FURY ROAD. He is not suited for that but his suitability for the role of bomb defuse expert in THE HURT LOCKER is truly terrific. Strong guest appearances from Guy Pearce and Ralph Feinnes helped raise the budget cash and the international sales, I am sure even their roles are tiny but effective. Renner though is spectacular. I am not impressed with Kathryn Bigelow's previous directorial efforts but she has presented here with this film a redeeming result. Much of the hand held camera-work mars the quality and interest in the film, some of it downright irritating. However for a 2 hour war related film about the seductiveness of the adventure of war and its impact on one man with a family back home, THE HURT LOCKER is a great film. the scene in the supermarket with him searching for breakfast cereal is majestic emotional understatement. The title is terrible and will have put potential ticket-buyers off. So take my advice, and go, and then settle in for an experience in tension and emotion and humanity.",1
"This movie won the Academy Award for ""Best Picture of the Year?"" Seriously? Are you kidding me? I think that tells a lot about the Academy Awards and how completely stupid, pointless, useless, and misleading they are.Watching this movie was like watching paint dry, but thinking that at any moment the paint could explode. But then, when it does explode, you don't really care.I have noticed that ""action"" movies that are directed by women are usually not great. When I started out watching this movie, I had high hopes for it because I had heard good things about it, and of course it won an Academy Award (for whatever that is worth). And I thought it would be interesting to finally see a good action movie directed by a woman (Kathryn Bigalow). But instead it was a total let down. Maybe Kathryn Bigalow should get a job making movies for the Lifetime Network, and stay the hell out of the action genre because ""HURT LOCKER"" sucked.Watching ""The Hurt Locker"" made me feel like I was INSIDE a Hurt Locker! And all I wanted to do was get out of that locker and go do something else. Every time the movie built up any suspense or tension, Bigalow manages to slow down the pace and kill the scene. Also, there a lot of times when you think the movie is going to take a new direction, and really get into a decent subplot, but then it just simply goes NOWHERE.Don't believe the hype on this movie. Stay out of the Hurt Locker, save yourself two hours of life. Somebody should put an explosive on this movie and blow it up. Funny, a movie about a bomb squad that is, itself, a total bomb. How ironic.",1
"I was expecting something insanely brilliant and what ended up happening is I landed on a landmine. What a travesty that James Cameron's, ""Avatar"" the highest grossing film of all time; a film in which his direction has transcended film and technology that will effect people for years to come. I liked every movie that was nominated better than ""The Hurt Locker,"" hell I'd rather go sit at ""The Foot Locker"" trying on some shoes while watching the movie ""Up"" now that would be a much better experience. It just goes to show how stupid this whole process has become in some instances where everyone feels the need to give someone something that doesn't deserve it. I am very, very disappointed. The writing in this film was... just so, so, the acting was decent, the directing was decent... the story... was okay... but that's it; the only thing people will remember about this film is the fact that Hollyweird decided to give an award to a woman for being a woman... isn't that racist? Race, creed, color or gender...",1
"THE HURT LOCKER won the Best Picture Oscar of 2009. It also made history in that Kathryn Bigelow, it's director, became the first female to win the coveted Best Director Oscar. Right off the bat, I have to say that I think she deserved this award. The direction is definitely expert. Bigelow keeps the action at just the right pace and every scene is the right length. There is just the right amount of character exposition also. Actually, not much is revealed about the main characters SSG Will James (Best Actor nominee Jeremy Renner), SGT JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), and SPC Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). It is a straightforward tale of men in the most tense combat situations. James, Sanborn, and Eldridge are a 3-man Explosives Ordnance Division (EOD). Their job is to diffuse bombs. James is the EOD expert who did the diffusing and Sanborn and Eldridge were his security and point men.What struck me most about this film is how tense EVERY scene was! I found even what should have been the most unassuming scene very tension-filled as I realized that these men live on the edge every second of every day. The bomb-diffusing scenes are all very exciting and tension-filled and not just because of the impending doom of a bomb exploding, but due to the unknown factor of whether it is a timed bomb, or if there is a trigger man nearby. Any Iraqi in the vicinity was a suspect and not to be trusted. There is a very tense scene in the middle of the film that ironically has nothing to do with diffusing a bomb, but still is an ""action"" scene, and I found it to be the most tense, powerful scene of the film.Renner definitely deserved his Oscar nomination, and perhaps should have won. It's not a showy role at all, but he makes the most of it. He plays the role very close to the vest. He simply IS SFC Will James, a man who is perhaps TOO good at what he does to the point that he gets lost in it sometimes and forgets others around him, due to the gravity of what he does. He kind of comes off as a modern cowboy and a wild man of sorts. He gets a rush out of what he does and then tops it all off at the end of the day with a smoke and a drink and doesn't get phased or let his emotions get in the way of his mission.Mackie (as Sanborn) and Geraghty (as Eldgridge) are very solid in their roles also and are given their moments to shine as well. Eldridge suffers from immense stress as he must interact with the camp psychiatrist Lt. Col Cambridge (a solid, straight-laced Christian Camargo) on a daily basis when he comes back to the rear. Geraghty gets to play a very emotional scene early in the film where Eldgridge recounts the opening film scene where one choice by him could have made the difference between life and death. Sanborn is a by-the-numbers grunt who just wants to get the job done with a minimum of fuss; while at first he kind of resents and dislikes James, through the course of the film, he gains a healthy respect for James's professionalism, bravery, and leadership skills. The last scene between Mackie and Renner late in the film in the Humvee is extremely provocative and powerful as each man essentially reveals what the war has done to them.The film also has 3 big-name cameos in Guy Pearce, David Morse, and Ralph Fiennes in small, but pivotal roles and these actors do a great job with their small parts. The original screenplay (by Mark Boal)also won an Oscar and I think it deserved it as well. While the dialogue is nothing new, it is very realistic and convincing and there are actually moments of legitimate humor at the most perfect times that comes out of it. This actually seems like the way that these guys would interact and talk to each other. The focus is strictly on these 3 men, especially James, so this is much more of a tight character study than a treatise on war, although it definitely makes a powerful statement about what combat does to a soldier.I find most of today's war films somewhat overrated. Seems like they either try to do too much with a lot of hard to follow action, heavy breathing, and shaky camera movement (like BLACKHAWK DOWN) or they are extremely downbeat and underdone (like JARHEAD). But THE HURT LOCKER manages to avoid these clichés and essentially be honest and truthful about the way men would act. Again, it's not about the Iraq war...It's about men at war.The film itself is not even really a commentary on the war in Iraq. It just shows us what these men go through in their day-to-day grind, but it doesn't pontificate and become preachy. The film moves in one direction and doesn't stall at any point to become boring. THE HURT LOCKER is a superb character driven drama with immensely tense and riveting situations that just happen to take place in the Iraq war.",1
"Greetings from Lithuania.WOW! What a film! This is ~2 hours edge of your seat stuff. As much as i love ""Avatar"" - this one has to win a Best Director Oscar. And, once again, as much as i love ""Avatar"" - ""The Hurt Locker"" is the best edited film of this year (and one of the best ever).I'm not an American,and i don't really know all the aspects of war in Iraq. But this movie is SO much more than just politic, it's a spectacular character study (almost as good as we saw in ""The Thin Red Line"").Watch this film, because it's a ""small"" masterpiece in almost every possible way. BRAVO to Kathryn Bigelow - and, for the last time, as much as i love ""Avatar"" - good luck on the Oscars evening.",1
"Quite easily the best movie of 2009 and the best war movie since Black Hawk Down and maybe even beyond that, The Hurt Locker does something that few other war movies seem to be able to do. Rather than focusing on rapid-action combat scenes and the oh-so-emotional mental breakdowns that all soldiers seem to dramatically endure in Hollywood (Platoon, much?), it emphasizes the relationships of soldiers and the intensity of everyday living in Iraq– intensity that doesn't diminish when the guns are holstered. And that's where you'll see the real difference.The film introduces a seemingly new and unique idea by following a U.S. Army Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) team as they go around defusing potential bombs all around town– a concept that allows the typical fast-action war theme to take a backseat to the dramatic intensity of the three team members' escapades and arguments. It's all about survival and this time around, it's the calm, isolated atmosphere and the feeling of never being truly safe that creates the ever-present suspense. The exceptional editing is partially to thank for such constant energy and pace. Quick transitions ensure that there is never a dull moment and the audience is always thrust into the middle of the action. Plus, director Kathryn Bigelow employed some amazing cinematography (thanks to Barry Ackroyd, United 93) and some of the best shaky hand-held-cam and zoom work I've seen yet. It seems that, for some, this might be a turn-off, but personally, I believe those who complain about shaky cam need to take a closer look at its purpose and realize that it's far more effective in establishing a documentary-like feel for raw and engaging films such as this one.The interaction between the soldiers is a key point of the film and the entire project is clearly intended to be largely character-driven. You will more than likely find yourself sympathizing with all of the main characters at some point and several others along the way. More than just observing a character's breakdown at the scene of war such as in films like Jarhead, The Hurt Locker immerses the viewer in the world of the characters themselves and practically forces you to care for them– and I mean that in the best way possible. And perhaps the difference is also partially distinguished by the quality of acting. And if there's anyone who deserves recognition for their acting, it's most certainly Jeremy Renner, who surprises with a top-notch performance as Staff Sergeant William James. His performance will have you laughing at bits of humor scattered throughout, gasping in disbelief at one point, shedding a sympathetic tear at another, and yelling at him in exasperation in yet another scene. The characters are never two-dimensional and the film always manages to provide constant reminders that all of the soldiers are just normal people in war situations, driving its purpose home even more effectively. Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are impressive in their own roles and share great chemistry both with each other and with Renner. The relationships between the three follow no stereotyped guidelines and their interactions are almost always unpredictable. Further down the billing, Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes also give solid performances worth mentioning.Overall, The Hurt Locker is a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through and packs a visual and cinematographic punch without the over-the-top Hollywood action scenes and special effects. While the storyline may be inaccurate when it comes to certain little details (as many war vets have noted), it's a unique one and allows for much more realistic and well-rounded characters. You'll walk away with your heart still beating fast for a good while after the credits roll and it'll make you think for an even further extended period of time. Everything about its design and execution will stick with you.--The Motion Picture Underground",1
"I am definitely in the minority opinion on this one. ""The Hurt Locker"" has won more ""Best Picture"" awards from the critic groups than any other film this year. However, not only did I not like it, I found it hard to sit through.There is minimal plot and little character development. They disarm bombs, fight, and disarm more bombs. That is the entire movie. But the worst part was that the camera never stops moving and is constantly shaking. This has been a recent fad in film making and it is supposed to make it seem more real because it has a cheap, documentary look to it. The camera was shaking so much it was making me nauseous to look at the screen.I normally don't care for war movies and ""The Hurt Locker"" was no exception. But you don't need to take my word for it because the critics love it.",1
"The rush of battle is a potent and often lethal addiction, for war is a drug. The Hurt Locker is about the soldiers involved in the Iraq war. Thompson is a bomb disposal expert and he gets killed during a mission to dispose a bomb. Then Sergeant First Class William Jones takes over Thompson's job and he becomes the team leader of the EOD unit. He has Sergeant JT Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge in his team. Will is kind of a free spirit who doesn't give a damn about his life, this is what Sanborn thinks about him and is weary of Will. Owen is a newbie and he is very scared for his life every moment of everyday that he is out there outside his camp, he doesn't want to die. But theoretically, everything out there could be a bomb meant for them to die and they have to survive. 'War is really hell on earth' is what these young soldiers will learn on their journey.Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, this film is a very great character study of the soldiers in Iraq rather than just another mediocre war movie. This made me feel sad both for the USA soldiers, the children struck in Iraq and also some good Iraq people. They are just stuck in somebody's war and live in fear most of the time. The film has many moments and dialogues which bring a smile on the face, but beneath it all you can still feel the gloom the war brings. Will knows that he lives for the adrenaline rush that only a war can bring. Without it, in the real world back in America with his family, he feels like a nobody and he wants that rush of adrenaline. Sanborn and Owen are very angry over Will's 'devil may care' attitude because he is also putting their lives in danger. There is a scene with snipers in the hot desert and it is very heart breaking to see them suffer. Also the scene in the shower is very good. William, even though he has a lethal addiction to war, is a very sympathizable character. The little Iraqi boy, Beckham, I liked him a lot. When he becomes a human bomb, I cried for him, the pain in Will seeing him dead like that overpowered me and I just couldn't stop myself. I have seen loads of deaths of kids and people in movies, but never have I been this affected by a war film. I cared so much for the characters. The movie gives an insight into the everyday life in Iraq and its very agonizing to see what they do. All of them have just over a month to survive in Iraq, before they can come back to America and new recruits are brought over for one more year so that the whole cycle repeats itself.William Jones, Sanborn & Owen Eldridge give very good performances in the film. And how could I forget one of my favourite actress Evangeline Lilly (Lost, the TV series) who plays Connie James, wife of William James. She gives a highly believable performance as the hurting wife of Will. She just wants him to stay with the family, while he thirsts for war. This isn't like all those other war movies which just wants us to say ""look at those soldiers suffering, I want to help."" This is an intense film and is made with a lot of passion. You will have to decide for yourself, what moves you in this film.I went to see Clash Of The Titans and couldn't get tickets, so I went for this and am I glad I did. I think it deserved all those 6 Oscars that it got. I didn't know before this that no woman director had won, how sad, but I am very happy she won. But, this a film which will be always remembered as the film which resulted in the first Oscar for a woman director. Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is a winner all the way. Go and see it if you still haven't seen it. The dialogues, camera-work, setting and everything is made to perfection.P.S: I can't believe how hot Kathryn Bigelow is:) Me & my mom thought she was only 34-38 when we first saw her in the BAFTA Awards on TV and we wondered why James and her separated. Also she is thrice my age and I have the hots for her!! Why James Cameron would divorce her, I don't know. Don't you agree? 10/10",1
"I'm not exactly sure when it became a thing among my tribe of film geeks to bash 'Avatar'. I know it wasn't when it came out, because most of the film fans in my circle of nerdy friends went to watch it multiple times and couldn't get enough of it. In hindsight, I suspect it was around the time when everybody and their grandmother seemed to have seen it; somehow, once the film had become the most successful movie ever (unadjusted for inflation) it stopped being cool to like James Cameron's eco-sci-fi extravaganza.Nowadays the film is often brought up in snarky movie blogs as a typical example for a film with great effects but a dull story, unoriginal ideas and bland characters, as if this were somehow the general consensus among film aficionados. ""FernGully in space"" or ""Dances With Wolves with blue cat-people"" are some of the kinder descriptions the film has to endure - which in all honesty I don't get.I mean, it's fine not to like the movie (all art is subjective and all that), but how so many self-professed film experts now pretend this critically acclaimed picture - which on Metacritic is rated even higher than 'The Dark Knight' - was nothing but a bland, unoriginal, run-of-the-mill Hollywood blockbuster that only succeeded thanks to the (then) novelty of 3D is frankly beyond me.What I find even more astounding is how the very people who decry the lack of original, director-driven blockbusters in Hollywood are often the same who turn up their noses at 'Avatar': an original, director-driven blockbuster that came out when most other big budget movies were either sequels or adaptations of already existing intellectual properties. ""The ideas in the film are not original"", they claim. Come on guys, seriously?So you've seen a world like Pandora before? A bioluminescent visual wonder that merges the colorful marine life of coral reefs with the lush vegetation of tropical rain forests? A world where nature forms an actual neural network that stores memories and builds a collective consciousness? You've seen many films about a bio-database that people can plug themselves into via ancient trees and communicate with their ancestors?You've watched countless blockbusters that take place in an eco-system where you can form instant symbiosis with other creatures depending on your needs? And by the way: how many ""eco-sci-fi"" films have you seen? Such a worn-out concept and tired old sub-genre, right?No my friends, in terms of Hollywood blockbusters, these ideas and concepts are about as original as they come, and some of them are even inspired by actual biological phenomenons (like the discovery that the roots of trees do indeed form a sort of neural network in a symbiosis with fungi where they are able to store and exchange information). But what is true is that the filmmaker cleverly chose a very straight-forward story to get his environmentalist plea and anti-colonial, anti-imperialist message across and make some rather complex sci-fi ideas more accessible for a broad audience.To that end, the film uses certain well-known story tropes (""the spy who changes sides once he falls in love with an enemy""; ""the soldier who realizes he's been fighting for the wrong cause""; ""the invader who gets to know and appreciate the foreign culture he's invading"" or the timeless trope of ""the fish out of water""), but they are not what the film is about. And those tropes are not copied from 'Dances With Wolves' either - any more than that film stole them from 'Pocahontas': they are so universal you can find variations of any one of them in numerous legends and stories and thus also throughout film history, from 'Lawrence of Arabia' to 'Shogun' or 'The Last Samurai' and countless others.And yes, our heroes Jake and Neytiri are not the most complex of characters (though neither are they as bland as the film's most vicious detractors claim), but that's because they aren't really the film's main focus. 'Avatar's actual protagonist, its true star if you will, is Pandora. It's the WORLD we get to experience through Jake's eyes that really matters here, and the film aims straight for your gut - not your sci-fi nerd brain (which I suspect is the actual reason why so many former Cameron fans - now - claim to be disappointed with the film).More than anything, 'Avatar' wants you to lose your heart to this beautiful planet that functions as an obvious stand-in for our own threatened world, and the film is an unapologetic, uncynical declaration of love to the wonders of nature - as well as a call to action to preserve them. Which on an emotional level works marvelously: nothing in the film is as painful and shocking as the destruction of a single big tree, which symbolizes quite literally nature as the home and shelter we depend upon. It's a genius scene, and I dare you to find an action blockbuster where the distruction of a city or a whole planet carries even a shred of the emotional heft that the falling of ""Home Tree"" does in Cameron's film.So again (I'm trying to hammer my point home here ;-), 'Avatar' is simple? Yes, but that's the point: the simplicity and familiarity of the story are deliberate; the themes are not just derivative re-treads, they're as universal as those in myths and fairy tales and thus speak to everyone. And that's exactly what Cameron's intention was: to use simple enough tropes and archetypes to convey a heart-felt message that would work across cultural borders and reach people all over the world. Which, given the film's success, it obviously did.Personally, I think 'Avatar' is a prime example of visual and emotional storytelling done right, and viewing it for the first time offers an experience that is almost without equal in its immersiveness. And while this may only have been my own individual experience, 'Avatar' was also the first movie in a long time that completely vowed me in the sense that I felt like a little kid again in the theater - which had very little to do with the novelty of 3D. It was also the last time a film managed to do that.And even in terms of pure entertainment the film is simply spectacular. It's a rousing adventure with gorgeous visuals and top-notch CGI, filled with fascinating creatures and jaw-dropping future-tech, and the final 40 minutes of the film provide an all out, non-stop sci-fi action thrill-ride on a scale the world had rarely - if ever - seen before.Obviously that doesn't mean it's a perfect film, and as I already pointed out, it's fair not to like it for any number of reasons (above all: personal taste), but 'Avatar' is far from deserving the kind of snark and ridicule it gets these days. Get over it people: simple doesn't equal simplistic, and the fact that 'Avatar' is neither subtle nor cynical doesn't make it dumb (even if it does make it harder for some of us nerds to like it wihtout feeling slightly embarassed ;-).In all honesty, I believe if this had been a slightly more obscure film - instead of the most successful movie of all time - many of the same people who hate on it now would hail it as an epic sci-fi adventure classic for the ages. And as far as I'm concerned, that's exactly what 'Avatar' is: a modern classic by a visionary filmmaker and true auteur. Rant over.",1
"There's a moon that's called Pandora far away, its unique flora and its fauna hold the sway, keeping everything aligned, a rooted network gives a spine, but looting plunderers have plans to clear away. The indigenous in this place are called Na'vi, harmonious and peaceful and they're free, now Jake Sully has appeared, in a body that's been geared, to gain their trust and then encourage them to flee. But these folks are going nowhere and they fight, against an army with great power and great might, one for all and all for one, they must do what must be done, and hope that someone has the vision to see the light.It's a wonderfully told tale of sadness and disgust, especially as it reflects so well the losses of so many cultures, species and environments on a planet very similar to Pandora, and all because...",1
Hatts of to JAMES CAMERON for thinking and creating a vision like this. It takes a lotseof hardwork & research to build a whole new world. And there is a reason why this movie is still the no 1 movie in the world. I've never seen this kind of visuals in any other film. And this movie was made in 2009 that was an amazing achievement by the VFX creators & the director itself. You can easily get connected with the movie plot and the way the director has shown the Pandora world was just unbelievable. Cast of this film has done a fabulous job while performing so well and get into the character that not a single one will disappoint. Emotional scenes are so powerful that you feel the characters and their pain for what their suffering. Visual Effects makes this movie so powerful that every creature and big scenery scenes looks real. That's why it has re-released once again to feel the same experience. Don't miss this one on the big screen if you haven't seen it. It's a total new world experience. Can't wait for the PART 2....,1
"I was waiting for this day for the longest time. I was a kid back in 2009 when this movie released. So never got to watch it back then. But now when it rereleased I booked the first day show to a IMAX show and oh boy was I blown away! This is nothing short of a masterpiece! It's beyond belief how a film like this could've been made. Every scene, every shot is perfection. You are transferred to a different world and become so engrossed in the film. Never have I attended a movie where at the end of it people got up from their seats and started clapping! Last time this happened was after Infinity War. That movie too was a damn brilliant one. I'm from India and this is legit rare, where people go crazy, so crazy after any English film. This was one experience that I will never forget. I'm definitely going for it again next weekend cuz just once was not enough.Every human on the planet needs to experience this magnificent work of art!",1
"Nobody directs like James Cameron. Ten years in the works, and every minute was worth it. It is the Star Wars of the 21st century. Though the plot is derivative and bears some pretty close resemblance to Dances with Wolves and a little bit of The Last Samurai, it does not ruin a mind-blowing experience. Avatar has a great future ahead of it and, possibly another Oscar for the mighty James Cameron. Jake Sully, is an ex-marine, bound to a wheel chair. He seeks to make a fresh start on the moon Pandora where his brother worked. The moon has a military run mining colony. The business has brought humans into contact with the local natives, tall blue dudes, called Na'vi. The Na'vi inhabit a part of the moon under which lies a large deposit of valuable minerals, and the humans are trying to get them to relocate. Colonel Quarich who runs the operation, ask Sully to go under cover as a Na'vi, to learn the secrets, to give the humans an advantage. If successful, Sully will get his legs back. The magic of future science and 3-D effects give Sully a handsome genetically engineered Avatar body, and he embarks on his mission. Once on the inside however, his loyalties to the humans start to turn when his heart gets lost to the Na'vi princess Neytiri. Is he willing to fight on the blue side now?The landscape of Pandora is the most creative and inventive of the decade. There are creatures that you might find in your wildest dreams or your worst nightmares. There is flora and fauna that shine with the bioluminescence of a thousand deep sea critters, and also trees which dwarf the Empire State Building.I guess the only noticeable problem with Avatar, is a lack of original story. What you see on the screen will blow you away, but all the tough critics, may come down a bit on the fact that despite being the latest in film technology, Cameron uses a very old archetypal formula, perhaps just a bit too schematic. There are a few badly scripted segments of dialogue, but nothing that makes you wanna blow raspberries at the screen.What is most important is the fact that Cameron's story gets the viewer involved and offers a handful of memorable and likable characters to root for, and some to root against. This is the post- modern era, and originality is rare, but if there is any technical progress to be made in the world of movies and entertainment, there is one name that dwarfs all JAMES CAMERON, and after ten years hiding from the Hollywood mainstream, he is back.",1
"Forgive me, I'm going to jump from professional to fan boy for a while here. I haven't had the jitters after a film the way I've had for Avatar in quite sometime. James Cameron's Avatar is the most entertaining and enthralling cinematic experiences of my life. It is incredible, simply put. What Cameron has done here is the most passionate film project put out since Steven Spielberg released Schindler's List. His attention to detail and his zeal for pushing the envelope is so admirable to any filmmaker or actor who will ever do another film from this point on.Avatar is the story of Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine, who replaces his brother on a secret mission to infiltrate the Na' vi, the colony of beings that sit on the planet of Pandora, where there is a precious ore, that sells at a ridiculous amount. When Jake learns the ways of the Na' vi, his feelings and learnings will put him and the people he trusts in dangerous jeopardy.The performances here, in the sense of reacting, becoming, and understanding what Cameron has written are astounding. Not to be confused with a sensational bravura performance from some of the centuries best such as Marion Brando, Tom Hanks, or Diane Keaton; these actors along with the director inhabit these visual transformations with special effects as if they are have lived these beings all their lives. This is all based on character movements and reactions. Sam Worthington, as Jake Sully, is an actor who's on his way to becoming a star. Though he has problems with his Aussie accent often enough in the film, he gets the job done. Zoe Saldana, who plays Neytiri, a Na' vi huntress, is thrilling and electrifying. Stephen Lang, as the rock hard Colonel Miles, takes on a villainous turn to a new level in science fiction. He offers actual emotion and emotes evil to the audience and gains our hatred easily. Sigourney Weaver as the beautiful Dr. Grace, is sufficient enough to have on screen again teamed with Cameron. She lives inside her role with effortless ease, but suffers from some of the typical James Cameron cheesy lines.Narratively the film works perfectly on the cinematic level. The first forty minutes or so require patience and hope as it is the weakest part of the film and offers some dreariness, but when the second act takes off, it's sky high with no limits for James Cameron. Avatar delivers the best action sequences put on film of all time. That is the boldest statement I have ever made in all my years of criticism. I sat on this for two days before charging it out, but I mean it. It is the best visual experience of my life, period.Other than those visuals, the film pops with all the other technical aspects thrown into one. Art Direction is killer as the two worlds blend in perfectly for an acceptable time. The Film Editing is the crowning achievement of the film as it also offers the perfect blend of the two worlds, enticing the viewer and shifting us around. Mauro Fiore is the threat for a Cinematography Oscar this year. It was if the viewer sat down in a chair, put on glasses, and was literally placed on Pandora, spaceships, and floating mountains. The viewer can feel so engulfed by the imagery, you feel like you can smell the leaves from the trees. Avatar is utterly hypnotizing. James Horner's score is some of the best work done in his career. It offers a variable of devastation that moves the viewer to near tears. It goes back to his work on Titanic, where the musical instruments lifted the material immensely. The entire sound team is also locked and loaded for Oscar recognition as the feeling of animals, machines, and arrows buzzing by your head leave you imprisoned in Cameron's exquisite film.James Cameron has come back home ladies and gentlemen Cameron is back, bigger, badder, and mature in his crowning work of his career. Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Titanic do not even compare anymore. This is the film that can blend the fans of those two films together and lock Cameron into your heart. He's a definite spoiler for a directing bid for the Academy Awards. You have admire the raw, natural talent the man has. How could you ever conceive such an experience and put that much effort and work into it and have it pay off? The box office success will surely keep him in the minds of voters for various critics' awards. His screenplay, leaps and bounds better than 1997's Best Picture Winner, is primed, developed and ripe for the taking. Though, you do acquire the tacky and atypical dialogue you expect from a science fiction director of this caliber, you can appreciate the effort and the honesty of it all. James Cameron is everything Michael Bay wishes he was, to put it bluntly.Avatar will bring also great actors putting their best foot forward such as Giovanni Ribisi, who is as underrated as they come. Michelle Rodriguez who exudes sexy like any woman starring in a sci-fi epic. Joel Moore, showing his range outside of his comedic work in Dodgeball: An Underdog Story. And the classy veteran actors, CCH Pounder and Wes Studi, who just simply don't work enough.Avatar is one of the best films of the year. The most exciting, thrilling, and superb work you'll feast your eyes on in any theater this century. Cinema, forever, will remember the benchmark that James Cameron placed not only for himself, but for any man, daring to change the game, the way Cameron did. Avatar is a movie experience to be remembered, and please experience in a movie theater first.***½/****",1
"Although I was not too bothered about seeing Avatar as a film, I felt it was a bit foolish to let this milestone of cinema go past me – particularly when the thing it is hyped for are the effects and being the first ""big"" film to utilise 3D technology to this degree. It just seemed that watching it on my TV in about 9 months on DVD with a basic stereo system would be missing the point. Unsurprisingly I was right because Avatar is technically a brilliant film that deserves to sweep the Oscars in terms of awards for visual effects and other such categories.If we ignore the 3D for a minute, the actual effects look great and I imagine that it will still be impressive in 2D. The landscapes and world of Pandora are imaginative (ironic since how dumb the name of it is) and very vividly created to the point where you forget that they are effects when you step back from them. Likewise it is so easy to forget that the Na'vi are not actors in quite brilliant outfits and makeup because they look so real and move so naturally – it is a million miles from the films such as Spiderman or Indy 4 where you can see where the real person ends and the jumping/swinging special effect begin. There were points in the film where I found myself wondering how on earth they managed to get a particular shot and where the camera was, only for my brain to kick in a second later to remind me that what I'm seeing is entirely virtual. OK the fantastical visual aspects are clearly creations but I was startled by how accepting of it all was and, in 2D I thought that the effects were pretty seamless.In 3D it doesn't quite hit the same mark for me. The ""look it's in 3D"" shots are not as obvious as some of the other films (where stuff comes out of the screen for no reason) but it is still a little distracting when the 3D forces your focus or has stuff where it doesn't aid the scene. Of course the world of Pandora looks great with things moving around in front of you and the final battle sequences are great – the money is all there to be seen. Thing is, the reason I was able to think about ""how did they do that shot"" while watching the film is because the technical aspects of the film is really all there is to engage with. The plot is basic and obvious – others have talked at length about the rights and wrongs of a story where the white man comes to the aid of the indigenous people, so I'll not add to that debate. The problem for me is simpler than that, it is simply that the plot is weak and the script is just as weak. My girlfriend laughed out loud when the name of the mineral on Pandora was named as ""Unobtainium"" and there were plenty of things like this. The dialogue between the characters is full of needless plot exposition and thus doesn't ring true. Of course all this is helped by the action and the effects but the narrative and writing weaknesses are all I can think of when I have to listen to people tell me how Avatar is the best film ever.The cast manage to do solid jobs considering how easy it is for them to get lost in the effects (see the modern Star Wars films to see this happen). Worthington is stuck with some awful dialogue but he is a good presence even in his Avatar. Saldana's performance is good, again despite some of her expressions and dialogue. Weaver is ""so-so"", Moore is pointless, Ribisi is miscast in a character that is so clichéd that it needed a decent casting to make it be more than it was. I liked Lang a lot and his OTT badass character worked well. Rodriguez seems like she is there because someone important likes her and her character doesn't add a terrible lot. Voice work from Studi, Pounder and others is good.Overall Avatar deserves to be seen for its technical importance and how impressive it is but the degree of praise for it needs to be put in context by considering how it plays as more than just a special effects milestone. In these terms it is not as good due to a poor plot and script that hurts the actors more than the effects do by handing them some awful dialogue. That it works is testament to how impressive the effects are but there is not a terrible lot to gush about beyond these.",1
"I did see Avatar for the first time a while ago, and didn't know what to make of it. To me it felt like a visual feast if little else. Re-watching it again, I found more strengths, but there are several weaknesses that prevent it from being a masterpiece.Starting with Avatar's strengths, it is absolutely mind-blowing visually. The cinematography, landscapes, scenery, colours, make-up and effects are outstanding and are by far and away Avatar's strongest asset. I also liked the score, it is certainly not the best score I have ever heard, but it had some very nice moments, while Cameron's direction is competent, the message admirable, and the finale well and truly explosive. I also loved the flying sequences, they were breathtaking.The acting in general is a mixed bag. Sam Worthington is a charismatic enough lead, while Zoe Saldana is strong and spirited. Stephen Lang is an enjoyable and over-the-top villain of the piece too, however Sigourney Weaver is somewhat so-so, doesn't help really her character isn't that interesting while Michelle Rodriguez and Joel Moore aren't given very much to do.What didn't work so well is that Avatar's story, with themes of love in a time of chaos and man alone in a hostile environment, is rather simplistic and predictable. I also felt it took a while to get going, and that the relationship between Jake and Neytiri was on the dull side. And is it me, or does this film drag at times, particularly towards the end? Now don't get me wrong, I liked the concept, it wasn't exactly original, as I often heard it described as ""Dances with Wolves in Space with rip-offs of Pocahontas and FernGully""- but I am not going to join those who say that- I have to admit regardless of its originality or lack of it the concept intrigued me. Then there is the dialogue, which is nothing special and never quite rings true. There are some amusing moments but a vast majority of the dialogue in the middle of the film never quite convinced or came across as cheesy. The characters also came across as rather clichéd, especially Giovanni Ribisi's, and the character development was lacking.So all in all, Avatar does have a lot of strengths, but a lot of weaknesses too. I will say I preferred it over The Hurt Locker, which to be honest left me cold, but I think I would be stretching it a bit if I said it was 5-star masterpiece. 6/10 Bethany Cox",1
"Avatar is not the next ""Star Wars"" or ""Lord of the Rings."" It might be the next ""Matrix,"" though. Or, perhaps more accurate, the next ""Matrix Revolutions."" It's technically groundbreaking craftmanship put to work on a story that was played out after ""Return of the King."" There are a lot of bad guys, a lot of good guys, and sooner or later they're all gonna meet on the battlefield. The little details are not-so-shockingly unimportant, since nothing could stop, change or even, really, comment on the unstoppable trajectory of this film's story.It's the future. An Evil Corporation is parked on distant planet Pandora, mining the planet of all its precious minerals. The native population, big blue humanoids called the ""Na'vi,"" aren't too happy about this. The corporation has hired scientists to create avatars of Na'vi bodies to be controlled by human brains, in order to communicate to the Na'vi that...they better move, lest be bulldozed by the evil Col. Qautrich (Stephen Lang).Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is flown in to Pandora because his twin brother, who had an Avatar made specifically for him, is dead. The coincidence is an obvious plot device so that we can have a newcomer to Pandora to share in our amazement. Oh, and he's paralyzed, so running around in his new alien body is rather freeing for him.I don't feel as if I need to continue with the plot description. You know what'll happen. You've seen ""Dances with Wolves"" and ""The Last Samurai."" Heck, even ""Dead Man."" The Na'vi represent nature, the (all-American) corporation represents destructive technology. Quatrich has a Southern accent and says things like, ""we have to fight terror with terror."" The Na'vi are clones of Native Americans - filtered through the imagination of a white liberal. It's all very obvious.The question, of course, is whether or not it's entertaining. Well...sometimes. It certainly looks good. Some sequences - especially those with the winged beasts - are eye-popping. Lang makes a fun villain. Pandora is more derivative than original, it reminded me most of Skull Island in Peter Jackson's King Kong. All the monsters have a plastic-y look to them that make them feel too well-done. The 3D is distracting at times and I had a headache before the movie was over.But there are scenes and individual shots that pop with ethereal beauty. It's worth seeing for that reason, but I don't think it'll be as fun after multiple viewings. The great thing about ""Star Wars"" was the characters: Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, R2-D2, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and so on. They embodied the other-worldliness of the story, taking the weight off the effects.In thirty-two years, I don't think anyone will remember ""Jake Sully."" 6/10",1
"A film with the scope of James Cameron's Avatar was always going to be a risk both artistically and financially, especially in today's economic climate. Whether it will pay off monetarily is a question only time can answer, but this viewer can at the very least attest to it being an artistic triumph.Avatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an alien world. The beautiful environs, the exotic creatures and incredibly lifelike natives of Pandora arrest the senses, visually, aurally and emotionally. The world in Avatar is the true star of the show. The amount of detail and work that has gone into bringing this new world alive is seriously impressive, and it will be a while before we see anything that overtakes it in scope and quality. WETA Workshop and ILM have truly outdone themselves.Relative newcomer, Aussie Sam Worthington provides a solid human heart amongst all the science-fiction/fantasy beauty and Zoe Saldana gives an impressive performance as the 8 foot tall Na'vi, Neytiri. Even though the characters they both play are blue, giant, catlike aliens, they managed to evoke a chemistry and likability that pierces through the special effects.That's not to say that everything is perfect. The story is basic and dare I say, clichéd and predictable. We have seen it plenty of times in all forms of media. The bad guys are cartoonishly evil, and sadly paper thin. The love story, while charming, is also clichéd despite being between man and alien. But in the face of these shortcomings, Avatar is a success because its storytelling lies in the brilliant visuals.Avatar is a beautiful piece of film and a true event. It does exactly what cinema was always intended to - it takes us away from our problems and worries for a few hours and gives us memorable images which will undoubtedly and deservedly enter into the cultural lexicon to stay for the foreseeable future.9.5/10",1
"Avatar is James Cameron's child in waiting for longer than a decade. Twelve years since Titanic Cameron again delivers with a great science fiction epic with the usual tropes and clichés but somehow making it work. The film looks gorgeous and the planet Pandora will surely give nature pangs to many of us. It makes me wonder how much a great storyteller's skills matter- Everything and everyone was against Cameron and somehow, he has managed to deliver. If you haven't seen Avatar(how?) you should see it as soon as possible- this is a great science fiction adventure from a master filmmaker.",1
"It has been 12 years since Cameron unleashed the phenomenon that was Titanic and real fans would have to look as far back as 1991's Terminator 2 for their last proper dose of his incredibly epic action (True Lies, while fun, really doesn't count). So the anticipation for Avatar has long since reached fever pitch and beyond.Thankfully for the patient masses, Avatar has turned out to be the biggest and best event movie of the year, perhaps the decade. The story is pure Cameron simplicity – a paraplegic ex-marine is given a chance to walk again through the use of a unique alien body, called an Avatar. It is his job to gain the trust of the natives so that a greedy corporation can steal the precious metal from their lush moon. Jake's (Sam Worthington) crippled main character is the perfect point of contact for the audience – not only is he new to the visual delights of Pandora but his disability means that every moment in his Avatar body is one of glorious freedom from the confinement of his chair. When the Corporations intentions become more sinister, Jake must choose between his new found place with the natives and his own race and fight for what he believes in.Avatar combines parts of Pocahontas and Braveheart with a liberal dose of Space Marines into an epic whole that takes nearly three full hours to unfold. We could criticise that length, the weak story and the hammy dialogue. We could attack its thinly-veiled ecological message or the frankly bizarre spirituality in its second half but honestly nothing can spoil the experience while you are enveloped in it. And a large part of that is down to the brilliant use of 3D – which is both subtle and incredibly effective. Til now, we have been making movies with 3D elements, Avatar is the first truly 3D film and might well prove to be one of the most significant things to happen to blockbuster film-making since Star Wars.Cameron is also pushing the envelope with truly photo-real CG – something which has been promised for years but has finally been delivered with Avatar. The interactions of the characters with the environment is incredible and the detail on the faces of the motion-captured leads (Worthington and Star Trek's Zoe Saldana) bring them to life. You will believe totally in their performances, representing another quantum leap in tools which have rarely been used for anything other than spectacle.Make no mistake, Avatar is an important film from a technical standpoint but it is also great entertainment. The world of Pandora is a stunning spectacle from scene to scene and as Jake learns more about the Na'vi the film approaches the kind of light hearted adventure story which has been absent from movie theatres for years. Then the final act explodes into tragedy and desperate action, with the final half hour a blistering life or death struggle that has to be seen to be disbelieved.Over the coming days you will be hearing a lot about Avatar, and some of the critical reaction is bound to focus on its weaknesses in a bid to appear appropriately reserved and objective. But this is not a film to be dissected or examined, rather one to be experienced with a warm crowd, a great sound system, in 3D as you bask in the knowledge that the movie-making master is back!",1

"I was lucky to see Avatar at a pre-screening a few hours ago. It completely blew me and the whole room away and i dare to say it will do so to 80% of any audience anywhere. The remaining 20%, who always finds something to complain about, will whine about character development, dialog, story or the pop-corn.Well, let me tell you: they went to this movie with the wrong expectations.You have most likely met Cameron's previous work(s): Aliens, Terminator 1 & 2, The Abyss, Titanic (!), just to name a few.So WHAT should you expect from Avatar??? MORE of the same!!! More of revolutionary film-making, more of grandiose new ideas, more of never-before-seen special effects, more of 150 minutes without relapsing, more of the James Cameron genius...I am very happy that the trailers didn't give the full story away. Lots of emotions are waiting for the viewer, laughter and tears also. Cameron was very smart keeping the teasers as teasers, nothing more... as the full movie will take your breath away.You will practically not notice that you are watching a non-existing world, it is sooo real. Attention to detail is superb. You computer geeks will know what I am talking about. This move was not rushed in the making. No wonder it could not have been done before - not having the proper computing power.The wild life, the jungle, the animals, the Na'vi-s, or the dragon-like flying creatures are all so life-like, they almost pop-off the screen (and in 3D they actually do :) .The sound effects were so well done, that when I saw at the credits that Skywalker Sound was behind it, i could only think of ""yessss... now THAT makes sense.""Cameron is a visionaire - and again, he delivers, with full blast.A certain character says in the movie that Pandora (the planet where the story takes place) became his real world. My advice to you: let Pandora become YOUR real world for two and a half hours, let it make you completely forget about your life and problems, let it entertain you, move you, let it carry you away.Because THAT is what i expect as an exchange for my ticket.And a few hours ago i got tens of tickets worth of that.",1
"You wanna know something funny? Not even a year ago, early 2009, I was watching ""The Directors"" on the Reelz Channel and James Cameron was on. I was talking to my friend and saying how he is one of my favorite directors, he has an amazing track record of great movies, but wait, has he done anything since Titanic? I went on the net to check to see what he has done since Titanic and it says nothing but documentaries and he was working on a film called Avatar. I read a little about the movie and then a few months later came the trailer and I was just in awe. I was extremely curious to see this movie and couldn't wait as when we hear the name James Cameron, you can't help but expect nothing but greatness. The man is a perfectionist and it shows, he always goes above and beyond what he needs to do for a film and we got that with Avatar. My only complaint being like Titanic, the story not being the most original on the market, but I can't at all hate this movie. Originally wanting give this movie a 9 rating, I find myself thinking that I can't. This is one of the most visually beautiful movies I have ever seen in my life. My boyfriend and I saw this in 3D and I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen. James Cameron is back and I hope he never leaves Hollywood again as this was the breath of fresh air that we needed with Avatar.In 2154, the RDA corporation is mining Pandora, a lush, Earth-like moon of the planet Polyphemus, in the Alpha Centauri star system. Humans cannot survive exposure to Pandora's atmosphere for very long and use gas masks. In an attempt to improve relations with the natives, scientists create human-Na'vi hybrids called avatars, controlled by genetically-matched human operators. Jake Sully, a former marine, becomes a last-minute replacement for his murdered identical twin brother, a scientist trained to be an avatar operator. Dr. Grace Augustine, the head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement for his brother, and relegates him to a bodyguard role. Jake escorts Augustine and biologist Norm Spellman on an exploratory mission in their avatar forms to make contact with the Na'vi in order to help establish diplomatic relations, solve the problem of resources and end the threat of violence. The group is attacked by a predator, and Jake becomes separated and lost. Forced to survive the night in Pandora's dangerous jungles, he is rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi. Neytiri brings Jake to Hometree, which is inhabited by Neytiri's clan, the Omaticaya. Mo'at, the Na'vi shaman and Neytiri's mother, shows interest in the warrior ""Dream-walker"", and instructs her daughter to teach Jake their ways.I had another fellow IMDb user e-mail me a week ago asking me about my thoughts on the movie and he informed me that Cameron has been working on the story for years(many thanks to oldman007 for the info) and just now had the opportunity to work on it. I think that Cameron did a great thing by taking a break from movies as not only could he retire a good 25 times from the money he made on Titanic but we had an opportunity to appreciate him even more for Avatar. 2009 was kind of a lousy year for films and this was the movie that we needed to have that sigh of relief. From the actors, the special effects, the visuals, and the way the story is told was orchestrated like a perfect night at the theater with an standing ovation from the audience as everyone wanted more despite the 150 minute running time.I'm sure Avatar is sure to be in for the run during Oscar time, wither it gets a best picture nod or not, I'm not sure, but from what I've seen this does deserve every award it can get. I feel very bad if I'm over hyping the film too much for you, I don't want people to get the wrong idea that this is the Casablanca of the new millennium, but it really was just a relief that we still have potential in Hollywood to put out a great movie. Sigourney Weaver and Zoe Saldana stole the show and I think the reason being is because Cameron can make females very strong, beautiful, but doesn't over do it with his actresses and always knows what he wants from them and they deliver. Sam Worthington as the leading man, Jake, I was a bit worried as I saw Terminator: Salvation which was like spitting in James Cameron's face, he was the star in that film too and I thought he was going to just suck the life out of this film. Thankfully I was wrong and he pulled in a strong enough performance to carry the film with some incredible actors beside him. Avatar is very much worth the look on the big screen, it's a masterpiece.10/10",1
"12 years ago, James Cameron had a vision of Avatar in mind. A vision so ahead of its time that Cameron shelved his project in order to wait for the technology to catch up. A vision so imaginative & exciting that he, finally, went on to create the much needed technology on his own. And the end result was NOT disappointing at all. Avatar takes film-making technology to a whole new level & sets a new standard in 3D viewing. It's a milestone in the history of the art.Avatar tells the story of Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine dispatched to the moon Pandora on a unique mission who becomes torn between following his orders & protecting the world he feels is his home. Avatar is primarily an action-adventure journey of self-discovery, in the context of imperialism & biodiversity. Avatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an alien world. So, watch it in 3D cinemas only if you really want to experience the breathtaking vision of Cameron's world.Director James Cameron has, once again, broken all boundaries & created a visual extravaganza, thus, in the process, announcing his return which just couldn't have been better. From Terminator to Aliens to The Abyss to Terminator 2 to Titanic & now Avatar, the entertainment scope is getting wider & wider with every Cameron's film without compromising at all with the quality. The attention he has given to the detail is superb. Not only Cameron created a whole new world with its flora & fauna of exceptional beauty, he went on to create the culture, race & language of the Na'vi too & their love for their surroundings. They are to Pandora what humans are to Earth. Only difference being our ignorance to our surroundings.Avatar isn't an exceptional movie, overall. When it comes to plot, performances or dialogs, its a disappointment. Those things are no match to Cameron's previous works; Terminator, Aliens, Terminator 2 & even Titanic. The reason behind Avatar breaking every box-office records lies in the beauty of Avatar that's drawing people to theaters again & again. The unforgettable experience in 3D viewing, the dead-end beauty of Pandora, the never-seen-before film-making technology & much satisfying entertainment overall are all responsible for its grand success. It has started the change. It has set things in motion. Cinema is getting revolutionized. Almost every movie is going 3D these days because of Avatar. Still, none have been able to recreate that same magic or experience. That's why, Avatar is way ahead of it's time.Now, let's come to the strong points of Avatar. It lies in its visual effects, editing & cinematography. Editing, like any Cameron movie, is brilliant. The cinematography brings us closer to the beautiful environment, the exotic creatures & incredibly lifelike natives of Pandora. Those who watched it in 3D knows how heartwarming the feeling was to find yourself in the flora & fauna of Pandora. However, the backbone of Avatar is its visual effects. Groundbreaking from scene 1, it's not the surroundings but the details of the surroundings because of which Visual Effects of Avatar reached new heights. World's 2 greatest visual effects studios, ILM & Weta Digital, worked together to produce this gem, and the results are wonderful. The attention in detailing & the magnitude scale of Pandora are sure to leave viewers jaw-dropped. Just the detailing on the face of a Na'vi is enough to tell you about the dedication involved in its making.Technically, Avatar is a breakthrough in film-making technology, 3D viewing & stereoscopic film-making with camera being designed specifically for the movie. If one looks at the story, it isn't that bad too. Of course not the best or even among the best, but still, it has all elements of entertaining the general audience of the world & that's what this movie is doing right now. At least, James Cameron knows how to invest and properly use the massive budget of this movie, unlike Michael Bay(Transformers 1 n 2) or Roland Emmerich(2012, Godzilla etc) who rely only on VFX & nothing else. At least, Avatar scores pretty well above them. It tells a fine story & let VFX n SFX take this movie to new heights.James Horner collaborated with James Cameron for the 3rd time (after Titanic & Aliens) & no doubt, has given a brilliant soundtrack yet again. The score is not as epic as Titanic but is still excellent for a sci-fi film. The score is really beautiful & succeeds in creating the music culture for the alien race. The beauty of the music of Avatar blends well with the beauty of Pandora. James Horner has done a fantastic job.Also, the story or screenplay of Avatar won't make it to the great lists. So, its better you go without expecting a quality plot & screenplay from this movie but a feast for the eyes. And make sure you watch Avatar in 3D for an all new experience. You won't regret it. Missing Avatar would be like missing a turning point in cinema. So be a part of it.10/10 for Avatar's beauty & the wonderful experience I had in theater.",1
"James Cameron does learn from his previous efforts and keeps getting better and better, and he has come close to achieving perfection in his latest production, the marvelous and wonderful ""Avatar"", a film with non stop energy that entertains, teaches, and delights us. Though not completely original, the film shines because its elements all fit into place and take us through experiences which will probably never be matched or surpassed in the silver screen.""Avatar"" is the story of the conflicts between two worlds, one protecting his idyllic environment where everything has a connection to an unifying force and spirit, and another one that continues to self destruct by greed and lack of insight. As we are introduced to the wonders of Pandora, an ironic name if any, the wonders begin. Cameron has given us sights and creations of amazing imagination, with the fauna and flora that parades in front of our eyes, fantastic beings with much more life in them than most of any previous CGI creatures, come to mind the dinosaurs and gorillas of ""Jurassic Park"" and ""King Kong"", but the new animals show more force and agility, and what takes our breath away is how real their interaction appears to be.The crowning jewel are the humanoids native to Pandora, tall and proud blue skinned beings, lovingly rendered by computer programs that rely heavily on the performances of the cast. A million years ahead of the work done with similar process by Zemeckis in the disturbing ""Polar Express"" and ""Christmas Carol"", the people from Pandora manage to express their emotions quite eloquently, and those emotions range from jealousy to heartbreak. Most incredible work is done by Worthington and Saldana, as the central couple who must learn to understand and appreciate each other.Humand eventually try to encroach over the people of Pandora's natural resources, by any means necessary, and a epic battle results because of the destruction of secret sites in order to break the natives' spirits. These are powerful scenes, full of an intensity rarely seen in epic/fantasy films, and the last hour of the film delivers what has sorely been missing from the latest entries by Scott in ""Kingdom of Heaven"" and Stone's ""Alexander"", a vibrant and powerful collection of physical confrontations where survival is the key element, spectacle is mixed with sheer will and determination, and the results are magnificent.Finally, I can't heap enough praise upon this sensation movie, the best of 2009, one that is as powerful as ""Departures"", as imaginative and entertaining as ""Star Trek"", full of some of the wonder of ""Up"", and with great performances that recalls the amazing work of Robin Williams in the ""World's Greatest Dad"" and Jessica Biel's and Kristin Scott-Thomas in ""Easy Virtue"", films that like ""Avatar"" are worth a second or third viewing because they aim and hit their respective targets because of their pure cinematic power. How does one know that a film will become a classic? When one leave the theatre and can't wait to see it again for the sum of its parts, not by misreading the power of a single performance and hoping the luster will compensate for the mediocrity of the rest of the film, or by hoping that a set of clever lines will turn a screenplay into gold. Cameron has made sure ""Avatar""'s separate parts all work in tune, from its performances, to its screenplay, to its editing, and special effects, never forgetting that what matters the most is the fact that its heart beats with enough conviction to connect to the sense of wonder in all of us. A great film.",1
"It was Terminator in the 1980's and then Titanic in the '90s and it's definitely Avatar in the 2000s!! James Cameron is my most favourite director and he has once again broken all boundaries and created a visual extravaganza.Avatar is Cameron's latest magnum opus is probably one of the most anticipated movies since Titanic and now it seems that the visionary director has indeed created a film that'll revolutionise the world of cinema.The movie is set in the year 2154 and is about a man called Jake who can't walk and he is selected in the Avatar program where he has to go to Pandora jungle which is not a planet but it is one of the three giant gasses that is about 4 light years away from earth. On Pandora there are life forms such as the navis that are about 10 feet tall have sparkly blue skin, big eyes and tails. The humans have genetically bred human-navi hybrids known as Avatars. Jake is able to walk but falls in love with a female navi and now he has to choose the side between humans or the navis.The film was absolutely fascinating, interesting, entertaining and emotional. I loved the look on the Pandora jungle and it must be the best scenery in film history and the navis are definitely the best digital characters since Gollum from The Lord of the Rings. The special effects are so amazing that Pandora looks like a real location and you can mistake the navis as real characters. Avatar was almost 3 hours but it didn't seem that long. Avatar already makes it on my top 5 favourite movies and I intend to see it again and I am already waiting for it to release on Blu Ray because I'm sure that it will be one of the best Blu Ray titles.",1
"James Cameron has big ideas and big visions. Thankfully, the latter he dives into with a lust for cinematic glory and (with more money than some countries have in an entire year) he has made his vision of a planet called Pandora in the year 21-something something of a real wonder. If only his big ideas weren't, for the most part, cribbed from other movies and stories and archetypes. I would be reminded of Joseph Campbell's myth-buster formula that so many have taken to heart in adventure movies, but Cameron's formula would appear to come second to his attention to visual detail. This has its pros and cons, some more or some less depending on what viewer sees/hears in it all.It is ambitious, and quite expensive, and it all shows up on the screen. It has to be said, Avatar is absorbing to look at. So much time and energy was spent into creating this fictional alien species, the Na'vi, and it pays off in the respect that Cameron's visual fx team painstakingly makes it appear real and otherworldly at the same time. We might recognize the lush and green surroundings, or even some of the trippy creatures, and if it comes close to anything it's like Ferngully: The Last Rainforest squared and made semi-pre-historic. But it's the scope and grandeur, and when we see the Na'Vi in close-ups or even just far away, you can see the sweat and the detail in their faces, the human beings playing them projecting off the screen. I forgot, if only for a few moments at a time, that they were animated and done in motion-capture. If part of a filmmaker's job, in a situation like a super-mega-sci-fi epic is to make us believe in another world and place (even if it's familiar), then Cameron has done his job very admirably.So if Pandora is great to look at (especially in the practically prerequisite 3D, which also has its own levels of detail and nuance and doesn't just JUMP at a viewer), and if the technology shown on screen- of how a human being goes into an avatar, is fascinating, then why isn't it such a smash all around? Simple - the story, and the characters. Cameron does pay them attention, but only inasmuch as to get us going into the Pandora environment. When he has characters like Jake Sully (very good Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana, even better) saying such trite dialog and going through the motions of a story that is familiar to anyone who has seen Ferngully or Dances with Wolves or, to a lessor extent, Last Samurai or New World (super pro-environment, obvious anti-colonialist), it starts to drag the film with it. I never grew tired of the cinematography or the wonderful sights on Pandora, but could I have done without such one-dimensional gritting-of-teeth from Stephen Lang? Absolutely.I'm not sure if there should be more movies like Avatar. It takes a filmmaker with the ambition and drive, and the super-screw-you-guys clout that James Cameron has with such a project (not to mention the time for it allotted him - not since Kubrick has a filmmaker taken so long between projects), to pull off something like this. CGI-driven movies could progress thanks to the prowess displayed here, but it does need to be done with the right frame of attitude towards the story. Even if such story is formulaic as this one, a filmmaker does need to try and push the technology a little further while also not forgetting about the human element. Cameron comes close... no, he does go over the brink of doing style over substance, but for this case- and maybe just this one time from an otherwise masterful blockbuster director- it's satisfying.",1
"James Cameron's long-awaited Titanic follow-up is very pretty to look at but suffers from a flimsy plot and astoundingly stupid plot development. The characters are one dimensional, both as written and as portrayed, and there's hardly anything unpredictable. The only thing this movie has going for it are its state-of-the-art effects, which are truly boggling.Sam Worthington plays Jake, a paraplegic ex-Marine who's sent to a distant moon to help humans mine a mineral called unobtainium (in the running for the least creative chemical name ever). Seems there's a huge cache of the stuff under a huge tree in a jungle that's populated by an indigenous race called the Na'vi, blue-skinned, really tall people with feline characteristics. Meanwhile, a scientific program headed by Grace Augustine (played by a typically stiff Sigourney Weaver) has focused on learning as much as possible about the Na'vi in order to benefit scientific knowledge. Augustine's research (funded by the same company who's mining the unobtainium) involves the use of avatars, in which scientists form a psychological link with a mock-up that looks just like a native Na'Vi, the better for the humans to exist within the unbreathable atmosphere. Jake gets inside the Na'vi within his avatar and attempts to find out what they would want in exchange for moving from away from the giant store of unobtainium; during the course of his mission, he falls for the Na'vi chief's daughter, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). (Of course he does.) And as said mission drags on, Jake's perspective changes from meathead jerk to tree-loving jerk, and he begins to wonder if what he's doing is right.Is he serious? You're an alien race (humans) and have no business on this moon. Your employer's stated goal is to gobble up all the jewels he can find, basically raping the planet. Your employer will stop at nothing to get it, as he answers to no one. You're being sent down to find a diplomatic way to screw the natives out of the bounty on which they sit. And he thinks this might be wrong? A power grab ensues when the military leader of the human expedition, a Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) decides enough is enough and wants to bomb the hell out of the Na'vi, with the approval of the head of the company, Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), another patently obvious name. This sets up the rather obvious showdown between the primitive Na'vi and the gung-ho ex-Marine humans, who have missiles and guns and ammo and rockets and helicopters and who knows, even a Star Destroyer or two. The final battle scene is overtly reminiscent of the Battle of Endor in Return of the Jedi, in which the primitive Ewoks manage to defeat a stormtrooper army using only their quick wits and some old-school, homemade traps of destruction.But even if the plot doesn't need to be complex, it sure ought to make sense. Here's a nonspoiler question to ponder. Jake, under the guise of his avatar, is taken in by the Na'vi, whose spiritual leader asks Neytiri to teach Jake their ways. Why this is to be is not terribly clear. It's evident that the humans have made several attempts at learning the ways of the Na'vi but that prior emissaries had been scientists; as soon as Jake tells the Na'vi that he's a warrior, they're all about teaching him. I don't quite follow the logic here; if I were the Na'vi and had not been able to teach the smart humans who obviously (to me) were not there to do me harm, why in the world would I want to teach someone who's used to using aggression and violence to solve problems? I get that the Na'vi, as a warrior race, would relate more to the soldier, but surely they would be reluctant to share knowledge with someone who was outside of their group anyway, let alone with one who might well do them harm.Moreover, I'm not sure what the Na'vi thought Jake was, really. He looked like them, through his avatar, but they referred to him at least once as an alien. My best guess is that they just thought he was from another clan. Other clan? I'll assume that only this one clan, the Omaticaya, made its home at Hometree (yet another clumsy naming convention) and therefore was the only clan with a stake in protecting it. But if they simply thought Jake was from another clan, why did they let him in anyway? Why did they teach him? What purpose would it serve them? And on top of that, since the Omaticaya mentioned being approached by ""aliens"" before, doesn't it seem more likely that they would have assumed Jake was another alien ambassador anyway? This makes my brain hurt.I think it's pretty obvious that Cameron wanted this to be his own Star Wars, an epic taking place on a distant world. He uses the standard Cameron recipe of astounding special effects and innovation coupled with a weak plot and laughable characters and hopes it all comes out okay (although for a movie that gestated for more than a decade, that's simplifying things a bit). The effects, it should be noted, are really mesmerizing visuals of the jaw-dropping variety. The 3D effects were unbelievable, and I mean that in a good way. Avatar is extraordinarily shot, using 60% CGI and 40% live action, and the two elements are flawlessly intertwined. It's a remarkable film.But it's only part of a film. the entire movie seems to try pretty hard to keep some emotional distance from its audience, and when a film is emotionally uninvolving, it's lost the battle for your heart.And that's the core problem. Despite some wonderful, beautiful effects, Avatar gives us characters in whom we can't really get invested, and when a key element of your story is an interspecies romance, this is a crucial, fatal flaw.",1
"I am sure my comment will be lost in a sea of blue but anyways here goes...Just attended the Advanced Screening at my local ""Event Cinema"" BCC in 3DNow this movies graphics are gorgeous, everything is so real, the 3D just adds to the effect beautifully without distracting you.From a technical standpoint this movie is amazing, just the detail on the Navi's faces are amazing, they feel more real then their real life counterparts!Without giving anything away about the story, the plot itself is very solid, very character driven and perfectly executed by Jim, safe to say this is his best original story since ""The Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2"" and is definitely one of his best movies, so good it ties with T2 which is my most favorite movie of all time...So for those of you who have not seen this yet... WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!5/5",1
"I really did not like the way way this movie was advertised "" A film that will change the face of cinema etc etc etc "" . I'm one of those strange creatures who is actually turned off by hyperbolic markerteering . On top of that I'm not someone who's going to sit in a cinema wearing 3D glasses . It's bad enough being a speccy in real life . Who wants to add expensive insult to injury by sitting in a cinema looking like a muppet with shades ? In summary I had no intention of watching AVATAR in a cinema if at all In April I found myself on a very long plane trip from Heathrow to India and decided that because I'd seen most of what was on offer I decided to watch AVATAR . Being on a plane where the format is cropped and missing the 3D visuals means that you're able to concentrate on the story . The truth is that the plot is absolutely threadbare and is padded out with long sequences that might seduce an audience in to watching the visuals but plot wise there's nothing happening at allFault number one - there's very little happening to the plot for large chunks of the movie . Fault number two is that character wise everything is black and white . Good guys ( Read humans ) are blacker than the darkest night while good guys ( Read blue skinned aliens ) are so white they're brighter than the sun itself. It's almost like watching a simplistic revisionary Western where the Indians are the goodies and the calvary are the baddies . I say "" almost "" because Hollywood has never come up with a Western like that and never will . There is no complexity involved what so ever . The bad guys are bad guys and the good guys are good guys and there's no motives involved . Some people may complain that LORD OF THE RINGS also suffered from this characterization but at least the LOTR wasn't a 3D gimmick and had saving graces . Take away the 3D and you'll find AVATAR has no other function as a marketing tool . Also nice to know it was stuffed at the Oscars by the cheap and compelling tiny budget THE HURT LOCKER",1
"A crashing bore. There is almost no real reason to see this film. As you could probably tell from the previews or other plot descriptions, it is a virtual remake of Dances with Wolves, but starring elongated, CGI, blue aliens. Yet even that movie wasn't nearly as patronizing with its noble savage bullcrap. I am not exaggerating when I say I have almost never seen a less imaginative movie. But what about the visuals, you say? Well, they are pretty, and the CGI is better than it has ever been in the past. But I'd say it isn't even close to a huge step forward. A pretty tiny step, really, from The Lord of the Rings' Gollum. The (motion captured) faces look more expressive than Gollum's. But they still have far to go before the CGI creations look ""photo-realistic"", as the idiotic Cameron likes to describe his cartoon characters and settings. And they still haven't worked out just how to move CGI characters - they still don't look like they exist in any kind of real world outside of a computer hard drive. But I guess by now I have to accept filmmakers are always going to rely on CGI, and it's always going to look like a cartoon. I have to say, I did mostly enjoy it when Cameron was introducing new jungle creatures (I think the final tally is about nine different species of animals that live on the planet), but both the flora and the fauna are reminiscent of black light posters and prog-rock album covers (I'll credit Jim Emerson for tipping me toward that, but I knew even in the previews that everything looked a little too familiar). And the N'avi? They're Native Americans. Cameron's allegory is easily the thinnest I've ever seen in a major motion picture. Some critics have argued about how it allegorically relates to current American military woes, but, frankly, if Cameron intended any of it, he screws it up royally by making the N'avi 100% justified in whatever they do. It's every bit as black and white as anything George W. Bush ever said. I'm sure he loves the Hell out of this film. And, even if I tried to just shut off my brain (pretty impossible), so much of the ride is uneventful. If not for the film's final half hour, which is comprised of the big battle, I'd probably call this the worst film of the year. As it is, I'd probably rather sit through Transformers 2 again. At least I can marvel at the audaciousness of Michael Bay's tastelessness. It's better than Cameron's utter blandness.",1
"The plot is stolen from many different movies, there was only 3 good actors, the characters are either bland or stereotypical, and yet it made almost 3 billion. When I think a film is overrated I usually like it. I don't think of it as Oscar worthy, but I like it. Then there is Avatar a film I not only think is the most overrated film in history, but also on its own without the hype a terrible movie. It didn't have any effort put into the story at all. Star Wars took the ideas of many movies together to create something epic, but Avatar takes instead of being inspired by these things is just being lazy by stealing the ideas. It is an awful movie, but people and critics liked it. Why is that? Well that is due to the effects. Few watching, or reviewing cared about what the story was. All they cared about was the effects. Yes the effects and 3-D are great, but without the substance of a well written story it fails. I don't care if the effects are the best ever. Giving this film a good review based of the effects is like walking to your computer, and staring at the screensaver. You think it looks cool so you look at it. Next time you look up it is 3 hours later. Would consider that a good way to spend your time. No you would not, but you think that Avatar is worth your time. This a movie that is destroying filmmaking.1 star out of 4",1
"I saw this epic last night at the Empire Leicester Sq in London, which is a superb venue in which to view this film. Huge screen, excellent sound and an extraordinary Dolby, 3 dimensional image. The whole effect is mind blowing.This is a 'Must see' movie, innovative, and extraordinary. I think it will be regarded by most cinema goers as another milestone in the history of the art. The level of realism achieved is remarkable, and although the film is relatively long in real time, it retains it's excitement and holds the audience's attention to the end.Performances are good, but this is not the sort of film that dwells on big star value for the actors, although Sigorney Weaver does shine and delivers a very convincing performance, as do the rest of the cast. But as there is so much entertainment and action value on screen the human element does not dominate in the usual way.As Writer/Director, James Cameron deserves high praise for this creation and in my opinion it will break box office records. I thoroughly enjoyed this film.",1
"In the fact-based film The Blind Side, a burly homeless black teenager Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) is taken in by the family of Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), a spunky white Christian mother of two and assisted through school until he achieves success as a football player in high school and college, eventually being drafted in the first round by the professional Baltimore Ravens. The film, written and directed by John Lee Hancock and adapted from a book by Michael Lewis, is undemanding entertainment that lacks a great deal of subtlety but is continuously entertaining and emotionally involving and redefines the true meaning of family values.Michael who is known initially as ""Big Mike"" has been abandoned by his drug-addicted mother and survives in the slums of Memphis, Tennessee only by his wits. He sleeps where he can find a warm place -- a friend's couch, a Laundromat, a school gym -- when a family friend intervenes and helps him enroll in a private Christian high school. Sensing the boys' potential, football coach Cotton (Ray McKinnon) convinces the administrators of the school to admit him although he knows that he will not be eligible to play football unless he can keep up his grades. Seeing Michael alone wandering the streets, he is given a lift and taken home and made a member of the family by Leigh Anne, an interior designer who lives with her husband Sean (Tim McGraw), teenage daughter Collins (Lily Collins), and SJ (Jae Head) an expressive little boy who provides most of the film's comic moments.Living with the Tuohy family allows Michael to learn to trust and to begin to express some of his feelings from a life of poverty and neglect. Michael who is so big that Leigh Anne can hardly find any clothes to buy for him is also gentle and lacks the killer instinct required of a football tackle. Tutored by the adorable SJ and counseled by Leigh Anne to view the team as a family he has to protect, Michael begins to develop his aggressiveness as a left tackle and develops his skills, eventually turning the team into winners. To raise his grades to be eligible for a college scholarship, the Tuohys hire Miss Sue, remarkably performed by Kathy Bates, who admits to the Republican family that she is a Democrat, prompting Sean to remark that he ""never thought they would have a black son before they met a Democrat."" Besides his grades, however, Michael must overcome several more obstacles that stand in his way before he can enter college.The Blind Side shows Michael Oher achieving a transformation in his life based on his relationship with the family who took him and nurtured him to independence and self-respect. Sandra Bullock delivers an emotionally resonant performance as a woman whose life is enriched by her simple act of kindness and courage to act from her values. While the film breaks no new ground stylistically, it also resists genre clichés, has no movie villains, avoids cheap sentiment, and, in spite of patronizing images in its trailers and advertising posters, is a humorous, heartwarming, and satisfying experience. Ultimately, The Blind Side is not a film about sports but about the rewards of showing love and support when it is not always accepted or understood by the community.",1
"First of all, Quinton did a fine job in the lead role. Let's get that out of the way. Great acting job. He took the material he was given and played the role very well.However, this film is pure Hollywood sap, a ""feel good"" movie that picks and chooses factual elements and builds a fictional tale around them. The film loves the character of Leigh Ann (who is really not that interesting, although she is kind hearted and generous), and as a result, Oher is relegated to a shy over-sized charity case with no clue and no skills of any sort, other than his natural kindness and resilient character. That strengthens the focus on Leigh Ann's rescue actions, how she ""saved"" this poor aimless kid and gave him all the life skills he needed to succeed on and off the football field. It resonates with white suburban do-gooder audiences, but it's just not accurate.In truth, Michael Oher was already a very good football player when the Tuohy family took him in. And he had a bold, confident personality that rubbed off on everyone and made him a natural leader. He was a motivated, focused kid who knew what he wanted, but came from an environment where no one really cared or provided support. He was NOT a shy, introverted pathetic case. He just came from a terrible domestic environment and found stability with a nice rich family. The real story of Michael Oher is how he caught the luckiest of breaks and escaped the ghetto jungle and was able to leave all that soul crushing crap behind, and focus on academics and athletics in a completely different upper middle class environment. It's a study in how important environment is in the life of kids and teenagers, and how it can make a huge difference.But what we, the audience, receive is a Hallmark channel film that is nothing more than a lazy, formulaic, fictionalized ""warm your heart"" chick flick couched in a football world. Sassy dialogue, woman-takes-charge scenes, tender moments, etc -- all the usual stuff is there. The film would have been FAR better had it focused on Oher as the lead character, instead of Bullock. No offense to Bullock, who is a fine actor.It is well known that real life Michael Oher was very displeased with this film, and how it portrayed him.",1
"Nice to see Sandra Bullock come back after the cinematic travesty, called All About Steve(2009). This was a well made film, perfectly filmed,and great performances by everybody.Leigh Ann Tuohy(Sandra Bullock), seems to have the life most women would envy, a wonderful supporting husband(Tim Mcgraw), and two great kids(Lily Collins and Jae Head). But one day while driving home, she sees, a larger then life teenager which everybody calls Big Mike(Quinton Aaron), when she tries to talk to him, he comes across as a little withdrawn, and is nearly homeless, she decides to take him in, with her supporting family behind her. Leigh finds out his name is Michael Oher, and tries to dig up things about his past, in hopes of helping him, but the question is will she? I really liked this film, it manages to balance humor and drama perfectly. Sandra Bullock gave quite a strong performance, so Quinton Aaron, Lyn Collin, but Jae Head is quite the scene stealer. It also has a good football scene as well. And Kathy Bates is good in her supporting role also. I say see The Blind Side.",1
"I've been reading lot of horrible comments that are based solely on the issues surrounding the movie rather than the movie itself. I wasn't excited to see this movie, I'm not interested in sports at all. The movie kept my attention though and well. It moved along quickly and pulled me into the story and left me feeling inspired. I wasn't excited to see a blonde sandy bullock in a sports movie, I think that's what might have turned me off the most, but she did really good job! It's rare to see a movie where there's a really strong lead female character. Whether you like Leigh Anne Touhy or not in the end, she is certainly entertaining and Sandra Bullock does a great job of bringing her onto the screen. The youngest son did an amazing job! So much talent in him. The character of Mike I think could have used a few more lines, even if he's supposed to be shy and reserved. All the actors really did a great job though for the most part. No it's not an epic Oscar winning film, although I wouldn't be surprised if Bullock got nominated for something for her acting. It is NOT loaded with propaganda as the other reviews might suggest. It's a light entertaining pick me up film that would be an excellent choice to bring the family to, most likely the reason why they released it over the Holidays.",1
"Time to complain about a film that would rather take away then include an important aspect of a true story. When watching the film, one should say this story is about Michael Oher, a man who, with the help of a supportive, slightly wealthy family, was able to overcome his hardships of homelessness and loneliness through perseverance and friendship. But the reality of this film is far from that description. It is more about the stupid sport of football and the rich family taking in Michael. I felt that the film did not put enough into the character of Michael Oher, they instead took away from him. I can see the potential of the character, but the story of the film limits him of almost everything except for being a mindless brute on a field. I know for a fact that the real life Michael Oher is nothing like this, nor ever really was. This film was to shine on the rich family, and the goodness they implanted on the world. In a way, it was selfish to put them above Michael in his own story. Sure Sandra has good acting qualities, but that should not be the basis of the film. Anyway, it was still a movie of an intermediate standard. It lacks in many departments, but the worst is the conversion from the novel to the film. If they had focused more on Michael and not the family, then maybe it would have been a better flick, but alas.",1
"The Blind Side is a most inspiring film about Michael Oher a gentle giant of a kid who's not gotten too many breaks in life. But all he needed was a helping hand and he gets one from country singer Tim McGraw and Sandra Bullock and now Michael Oher is one of the top defensive players of the National Football League.Quinton Aaron plays Oher and for most of the film he's pretty mute, almost catatonic answering in monosyllables. He's brought out of the Memphis ghetto by a man who would like to get him just off his couch. Aaron's mother is a crackhead and she's long abandoned him. McGraw is a football coach at a private Christian High School and Bullock is his wife. The story here is how Bullock proves to be the mother figure this young man needs badly in his life. He becomes a member of the family as much as her two natural children with McGraw are. As for Tim McGraw he shows some acting chops and holds his own with Bullock and the rest of the cast.Aaron is a catatonic gentle giant, big enough for defense on any team, but lacking in aggression. Best scene in the film is when Bullock teaches him the necessary aggression needed for that sport.Rivaling that is a voice over narration of a composition that Aaron writes interpreting The Charge Of The Light Brigade. Aaron in the voice over proves to be quite articulate and definitely not stupid as was thought by many. I'd give the paper an A.The Blind Side is a wonderful family film for which Sandra Bullock copped a Best Actress Oscar. The Blind Side was also in the running for Best Picture of 2009. Quite deservedly so.",1
"The film is an excellent biographical film for an interesting and interesting story. I am not a fan of American football, but the film attracted me to sports. The representation of most of the actors was excellent, especially the white mother.",1
"I don't think I've seen a Bullock movie since ""Speed"" that didn't leave me watching my cell phone for the time. Her movies have been pretty awful and worth skipping. Not this one. The story received a lot of press and one has to give her much credit for snapping up the rights to it. She also did a fabulous job as the heroine. I was simply amazed. It was really one of the most amazing career rehabilitations since Travolta in ""Pulp Fiction"".I loved the story. It is a genuinely heartwarming tale of an abandoned teenager adopted by a wealthy family and guided to success. And it's all true. This is what make me love movies. What a great film! Go see this movie. I loved it and so will you.",1
"I don't usually feel the need to leave comments, but this movie was just to well done not to. I went in expecting more football, more hits & highlights & as a huge football fan that was one of the main draws of the movie. The football actually takes a back seat to a wonderful story that is well executed by everyone involved. I've always thought Sandra Bulluck has been over-rated, but she nails this role & deserves some recognition down the road. The movie is so fantastic that anyone and everyone can relate and feel connected to the characters. The ideal target audience for this movie is children and adults alike. This movie should be an Oscar contender but I know these types of movies rarely ever win. Definitely deserves my vote!",1
"Sandra Bullock is rapid and compelling in this true story of tragedy-turned-triumph. The Blind Side is an enjoyable that some may consider a bit too soft or safe. Though it won't completely win moviegoers over, they'll still be in awe of the bold lead actress.",1
"I'm a sports snob. I strongly believe there's only a handful of truly great sports movies. It's just too difficult for filmmakers to recreate the drama that takes place on the field. So when the Creative Loafers at sportschump.net asked me to review The Blind Side, a sports movie I would never see,starring an actress I really don't like, I was skeptical. But they promised me Jujubees, so I agreed to attend the premiere.I fell into my comfy leather chair at the Cobb Theater Cinebistro in Wesley Chapel, fully expecting to pan everything about the movie. Then a strange thing happened. The film turned out to be pretty good.Blind Side is adapted from Michael Lewis' novel of the same name. Just like the book, the film begins with a narrative of the game in which Lawrence Taylor broke Joe Theismann's leg. According to Lewis, that hit more than any other moment in football history, heightened the need for a strong, left tackle to protect the quarterback's blind side.Enter the Michael Oher story.Oher (Quinton Aaron) is an over-sized, high school kid from Memphis' inner city with no academic records and a crack addict for a mother. He is accepted into a local Christian high school when the football coach recognizes his potential.Early scenes at Wingate Christian High School depict Oher as uncomfortable and intimidated in his new, mostly white surroundings. One teacher describes him as 'a fly in the milk.' Oher never says much, most of his expressions portrayed through mopey, facial gestures. Aaron's performance isn't groundbreaking, unless of course Oher didn't say much in real life. If that's the case, his performance is dead on.After their youngest son (Jae Head) befriends Oher, Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy (Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw), stumble upon Oher one afternoon roaming the streets, avoiding return to his crime-ridden projects. They welcome him into their home to sleep on their sofa for a night, which becomes a week, which ultimately becomes a legal adoption.Despite Oher's poor grades, school administrators find that he excels in one capacity. He scores a 98% in protective instincts on a high school aptitude test.The Tuohy's, a well-to-do, Southern Republican family with a strong allegiance to Ole Miss, hire a private tutor (Kathy Bates) to help Oher with his academic troubles. Once getting good enough grades to make the football team, Oher has trouble adjusting to the brutality of the sport. It's not until Bullock compares protecting his quarterback to the affection he feels for his new family that Oher finally understands his purpose on the field.The word gets out about Oher eventually when a top scout is sent a DVD of his skills. Suddenly, major college coaches flock to recruit him. Sports fans will enjoy cameos from Nick Saban, Tommy Tuberville, Phillip Fulmer, Lou Holtz and Houston Nutt, although LSU fans will cringe seeing Saban wearing purple once again.The only problem is Oher is failing English, which makes him academically ineligible to receive a football scholarship. It's not until McGraw recites ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" that Oher learns about courage, honor and ultimately passes another difficult test: his final English essay.Oher decides to enroll at Ole Miss, which draws an NCAA investigation to ensure the Tuohy family did not tamper with his decision. Oher buys into it, then lashes out at Bullock, accusing her of taking him in just to get him to go to their alma mater. A resentful and confused Oher returns to the projects in search of his real mom, then busts up the local gangster's home, a scene which probably warrants the film's PG-13 rating.Little by little, the audience is allowed a peek into Oher's upbringing, not a pretty picture, probably less so in real life. The film features several touching moments such as when the Tuohy's drop Oher off at college or when Bullock confronts Oher's real mother, who can barely remember which man was his biological father.The film has its share of trite, Hollywood moments including McGraw and Bullock's designer marriage in which they never argue, Bullock telling off her country club friends in a moment of racial enlightenment, phoning the football coach from the sidelines to call in plays and Oher getting flagged in his opening game for 'excessive blocking.' Blind Side also glosses over several racial and class stereotypes, careful to equally bash Democrats, rednecks and Southerners. The film also provides several moments of comic relief in the form of McGraw's occasional one-liners that help to break up the film's drama.Without reading Lewis' book or knowing the complete Oher history, one might think the film is overdramatized, until the closing credits which show a sequence of real pictures of Oher being raised by Tuohy family. They remind us that Blind Side is not only based on a true story, it is a true story.Blind Side won't go down in the annals as the greatest sports movie ever made but it does have its moments. It's a touching depiction of what can result when some, give others, a fighting chance.Mo",1
"I'm sure Michael Oher is an inspiring sort of story. In fact his real story, the one glossed over in the film version The Blind Side, is kind of fascinating (unlike in the film, Oher was taken by several families over the years, some black, until winding up with the Twohey's as seen here). That he could make a difference, if only for himself, is a fine feat. But there's something about the movie that is sanitized, kept in the Hollywood bakery to make it fresh for a G-rated mass consumption. It's not even offensive to any great degree, except for the fact that the filmmakers relegate the main character to a secondary kind of role (rather, if he does have any real personality in real life, it's whittled down to make him a cypher, a character that does what he's told and never questions anything - not even why he becomes a football star).Oh, it has its moments. And Sandra Bullock has that feisty kind of 'All-American-Woman' spirit, the kind that wins Oscars (you know the kind, re: Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich). And her acclaim for the role isn't unearned as she puts a lot of passion and personality into the part, at least as much as the script allows. And Kathy Bates has an amusing if bizarre cameo as the lone DEMOCRAT of the piece (something she mentions like she's sad to be Satan coming through the door). But it's the character of Oher, and the actor playing him, that brings the film down. The film itself has its conventional pleasures and beats, but I couldn't help but feeling they left Oher out to dry, like a symbol of something for white people to rally around. Again, it's never too offensive, and its heart is in the right place (think of it, perhaps, as a sign of burgeoning White Conservative Guilt peeking out as opposed to garden-variety liberal kind).Yet characters outside of Oher don't bring much to the table either. I would've liked to have seen some other personality come out from, say, the high school football coach, or understand more about where Oher came from aside from the usual 'oh, it's a bad ghetto' thing. It's ultimately neither too stirring as a human saga nor as a sports triumph, but just run of the mill. And yet for another audience, children, it's a fine little piece of fluff (tell me the director wasn't thinking of a children audience during those plucky scenes where the little boy acts like an agent for Oher in front of the college recruiters).",1
"I rewatched it as I read the book days ago.It's pretty watchable a single time. I watched it again and man it hasn't aged well whatsoever. This is such a ""cheap"" movie. Everything feels melodramatic and lazy. The scenes are all set up as in any Christian B tier movie. Just direct camera work. Not bad at all. It's just... boring. I'm glad it's not shaky-cam, but at least add creativity and some shots from the air. Here we just see faces. It's people talking and the director is not focused enough to make it visually engaging. It feels like watching a cheap documentary.The acting is overall good. The small son is a horrible actor here. A damn shame. His scenes are very cringe. Overall the scenes are cringe as they always try to play up any conflict to level 9000. Even small conflicts are in your face. Compare this to The Wire that also had similar scenes in the ghetto. There we see the culture and the dangers. Here everything is a movie scene made to shock and awe and all scenes end the same way: people being overly emotional. Nothing is calm. The first 15 minutes were actually great as we didn't get flat characters. Then after that it became lazy filmmaking. They really didn't care about this story whatsoever. They just wanted to make a movie to earn some quick bucks.Now, I also do see some great issues about the story not really being the real story. The book has quite a few differences. The overall storyline is similar, but some changes are so Hollywood that it's cringe. Also, the book overall is likely 25% spin too so the movie just adds on top of that.In the book Michael visits his mom regularly. Here we don't see him visit her a single time. The whole point is that he ran away from foster care as a kid to return to his mom to sleep in a bed with 6-8 other siblings while his mom spent all her welfare on drugs the first few days. She didn't give them food or clothes and often didn't come home. But foster care was not great either as you have a bunch of violent kids, cheap beds, cheap houses, people who just want to make state money by taking in kids. So overall the situation was bad. In such families the dad goes away right as the child is born or you don't even know who the dad is. It's crime and drugs. This movie used the scene where the children were taken from their druggie mom. But it's a flashback scene we see about 5 times. It's never clearly explained. His mom looks healthy and young here. That's not really how a drug abuser lives or acts. She also says she doesn't want to see her son in her condition and that she used to do drugs. In real life she wasn't really clean. And here they should have showed that a bit more clearly. Also, in real life his mom and family members were extremely eager to see him as often as possible. He was on the way to making millions. What do you think happens in such a case? The brothers and mom just stay away? In the book his step-parents even talk about how it's a good thing that his dad died as that means he won't be coming after him for money. And his mom calls him SO MUCH that he stops taking the phone. Obviously they wanted his money. Here he's just by himself.We also didn't meet his Black friend here. We didn't see him talk about how he would send money to his family in the ghetto as the first thing and get them out of there. NFL players make millions a year and plan for all of this.How he was discovered was also changed. It's made into a gag where 2 different events are combined. That's actually done a lot in this movie. 2 different events are combined so that one causes the other while in real life there could even be a year between the events. In reality people just saw he was a huge guy and therefore considered him a gigantic talent even before he started playing football. NFL is eager to get big dudes. Even athletes who, like Michael, are terrible at football initially. The size will do the talking. Here we didn't even see how he played basketball regularly. Here he sorta just starts playing football later on while being extremely out of shape. He moves like a fat guy not an athlete and he barely trains for anything here. In real life he always wanted to be a professional basketball player and get to NBA. He is actually quite arrogant that way. When he made it big he proclaimed that he just worked his way up and that he wouldn't give money to others like him as they should just work their way up too. I'm not saying it's morally wrong. I'm just saying the movie doesn't show that. Here he's acting like a little kid. In real life he was quite focused on athletics and arrogant about his abilities. He is just very low IQ, like many Black people and Black athletes, so he didn't really talk much when teachers talked about complicated matters. And as his mom was a drug addict there is not much he wants to say about his personal life either. He didn't speak much at all, true, but the movie totally missed the arrogance aspect that was his personality once you uncover his true character. It's not a bad personality as such. It would be interesting to see it.We also don't learn about his great memory that made him pass exams. It's not ""love and care"" or whatever that made him pass them. It's a great memory while having low IQ - and then tricks and cheats. His family in the movie talks about ""doing something"" to make him pass his exams so that he could get to college and then NFL. But in the movie they don't do anything close to cheating. We just see his teachers give him verbal exams as he can't read or write well. In real life his new family paid for a new IQ test that put his IQ at a White person's level. Which is quite clearly a fake result. That way they could claim he had a learning disability and not low IQ. And hence just needed extra tools in college instead of not being allowed in. They also gave him a ton of substitute exams to replace his low school grades. For example, you can take a new language exam to replace some Spanish exam you studied a year for. These were the exams done verbally 1-to-1 where one assumes adults could ""help him"" get to the answer like in the IQ test. Hence we don't know how much he actually knew or passed. They had money to make it all work. In the movie all of that is replaced with teachers just claiming that ""he is actually smart we just need to teach him a different way!"". Riiiiiight. He raised his IQ 20 points and just needed ""a new way"" to become really smart. It's a movie I guess. It's curious they have Sandra Bullock allude to something only found in the book. I guess it's a way for the director to claim it's a true story.The fight in college where he by accident made a small child bleed from his head here happens in his ghetto before he attends college. With all the other changes this smaller stuff adds up even though it's quite similar to what happened in real life. The lesson was that if you as a Black man break the law in a White setting you will be kicked out. This lesson disappears when you just making him act like a small puppy among White people. In reality it's a learning experience. He's a huge talent so he wasn't kicked out from college. And he wasn't kicked out for being too stupid. It's money privilege, but also talent privilege. A regular Black kid who didn't pass any exams and got into a fight would not really get all these passes. Which the movie also doesn't illustrate in any way. He just is this good guy with a talent. The book expands on all of this.It's also a shame we don't see a bit more about the Black coach who helped him at the start and let him stay over. I feel like these good Black guys helping out in the community need more recognition. Reminds me of the Black boxing coach from The Wire. This movie is 50% about Sandra Bullock. She's in most scenes and doing most of the work so they couldn't fit in much other stuff. The White dad was actually the one who got Michael close to the family. He gave him free stuff, paid for his food, helped out athletes overall. Here there is a scene where he sees Michael scavenge food yet does nothing. The guy in real life walked up to Michael and then, without even telling him anything about it, paid for his school lunches. Before his wife even knew about Michael. They totally erase his story to make Sandra Bullock do 80% of what he did in the book. I get why, it's her movie. But it just feels wrong. These 2 men in his life made a huge difference and became his father figures to make it all work for him in the sport. They cared. They are nice guys here too, but Sandra Bullock does the coaching and gets him to NFL here. Keep in mind she's just a former cheerleader. Her husband was a basketball player who is a booster for kids, meaning he helps young kids get into sports. So it's weird his role is removed here. But he's still a nice guy in the movie.Overall it's not quite the real story. But it's fairly close. The movie is just lazy. The emotional scenes are so extremely in your face that I couldn't handle it. Like, there are maybe 3 scenes where his step-sister high fives him and says ""good job bro"". The scenes are clearly added to illustrate that Michael is not sexually attracted to her. They have a goal, it's still bad film making. We also linger on people for too long. They want us to reaaaaaally feel what they are feeling. So when someone says something offensive the camera will linger on the person who heard it. We have a close up of a face for 4 seconds. It's unbearable. The lazy camera work makes everything linger seconds too long in an unnatural way where everyone looks like they are about to cry or kiss. It's creepy. You are supposed to make it feel like real social interactions not some extremely emotional stuff where you feel like everyone is constantly ready for hugs every second scene. It's so much feel good that it's fake. So eh, fine enough movie I guess. Something interesting scenes. It's just so lazy that I'm offended.",1
"This relentlessly feel good movie strives and succeeds in all it sets out to do. It reassures us all that not only is all well with the world, it really is a pretty wonderful place. Walt Disney would be proud.Disney's family fare of the sixties portrayed characters as totally one dimensional. The mean were mean, the kind were kind, etc. etc. Characters simply had no inner conflicts or doubts. Audiences, particularly children, found this spoon fed story telling very enjoyable. If only life were that simple.Well in ""The Blind Side"" life is that simple. The characters in the movie are unashamedly one dimensional. This good natured family doesn't bat an eyelid about taking in an underprivileged over-sized young black teenager into their smart home. They might as well have picked up a stray pet. Those squeaky clean smiling children take to Big Mike from the projects without a hint of hesitation. There is nothing wrong with movies reaffirming the basic goodness of mankind. God knows there are enough that have succeeded in proving the opposite. But pandering to the need to believe in such goodness in such a simplistic, needless to say, unrealistic manner is misguided. It's making us feel good at the cost of integrity - and succeeding.Sandra Bullock does with the role exactly what she's demanded to do and that really is not very much in the way of an acting stretch. We've seen her good nature shine numerous times before. Why this time it garnered her an Oscar is very probably as she herself put it, she simply wore them down.",1
"In Memphis, when Coach Burt Cotton (Ray McKinnon) sees the athletic potential of the homeless Afro-American teenager Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), he convinces the other teachers of the Wingate Christian School to accept his application. However, the outcast Michael has serious trauma with his abused childhood and his grades are not enough to join the Crusaders football team of the school. When the wealthy Caucasian Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) sees the youngster walking alone of the cold road, she easily convinces her husband Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw) to lodge him home. The Tuohy family welcomes Michael that becomes part of the family and close to the boy S.J. (Jae Head) and his teenage sister Collins (Lily Collins) that helps him against the prejudice and intolerance of their mates in the private school. Leigh Anne and her family adopt Michael and help him to improve his education and their lives change for better. Michael joins the Crusaders and distinguishes in the championship, being invited to join several universities. However he needs get better grades to join Ole Miss where Leigh Anne and Sean had studied and are sponsors. Leigh Anne hires Miss Sue (Kathy Bates) to work as tutor, giving private classes to Michael to improve his grades and be successful in life.""The Blind Side"" is the wonderful heartwarming true story of a lonely homeless teenager that moves to the house of a Caucasion Christian family that follows the principles of their religion helping the others. The screenplay is magnificent and the top-notch performance of Sandra Bullock is helped by the powerful and enlightened character Leigh Anne and the stunning chemistry with Tim McGraw. This uplifting movie is highly recommended to make the viewer believe that still there are good people in this wild world and a great family entertainment. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Um Sonho Possível"" (""A Possible Dream"")",1
"I have just returned from seeing the blind side. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie, particularly it's more poignant moments. Yes, this is a sports story, yes this is a biopic, but it is also in large part an interpersonal drama. It is rare to see a movie these days that relies on drama to carry it-not special effects, lush historically accurate wardrobe, or astounding make up- just a story that resonates with the viewer. That this story is based on contemporary facts makes it all the more resonant. Events that might have been handled superficially, predictably or exploited for dramatic purposes were instead presented in a nuanced and profound manner. Michael's biological mother was portrayed with dignity and compassion. In short, the aspects of Michael's story that make it moving and inspiring were captured with skill and integrity. As for the negative feedback regarding this movie that began when the only the trailers were available - I think the comments might be more a reflection of the world view of the authors rather than a reflection of the quality of the movie or the reality of Michael's story. Some people think the movie ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was a story about racism in the south, or that ""The Crying Game"" was a movie about the IRA - to me those were the settings for the drama, and not the drama itself. John Lee Hancock really bit off a lot when he took on this project-but as it turned out, it was not more than he could chew. Remember when Attorney General Eric Holder commented on how we were a nation of cowards when it came to openly discussing race? With this movie, Hancock has demonstrated he is not one of those cowards. He did not ignore the racial or class differences of the characters in this movie, and he avoided using the movie to make a social statement with the movie. He allowed these character attributes to be what they were in reality, and told the human drama in an effective and sensitive manner.",1
"A few months after the Academy Awards we decided to see this movie since it was nominated as one of the 10 best pictures of year and of course Sandra Bullock was named Best Actress. While it was a good performance by Bullock who had a fine southern accent for her character, we decided that she probably was given the Oscar for ""her body of work"". The movie was a predictable ""feel good"" story that in our opinion was not in the same league as the other nominees for best picture. It is based on a true story of Michael Oher, an over-sized black teenager from the wrong side of the tracks ( Quinton Aaron), who gets ""adopted"" by a rich Memphis couple ( Sandra Bullock and country music star Tim McGraw) with two kids of their own. The school football coach drools over his potential as a offensive lineman but it is not until his new Mother knowing that he has tested to have high aptitude in the ""protectiveness"" scale encourages him to ""protect"" the quarterback or the running back as he would protect his own new found family does he show his stuff. He now is able to use his size and power and become a great football player who is recruited by many colleges including his new parents alma mater ""Ole Miss"". In order to play football and stay in the game he had to be tutored by a teacher who also went to Ole Missplayed by Kathy Bates. There are a few mild twists and subplots in the story line but no big surprises. You come away from the movie with a warm feeling, especially as you look at the closing credits interspersed with photos of the real Michael Oher and the family that adopted him, as well as confirmation that he eventually made the NFL.",1
"There's a word that I learned listening to smart people talk about issues and subtext and social justice and post-modernism: ""problematic"". When a person has a problem with something like a video game or capitalism or the way coffee gets to my house, when they think it's bad or wrong or unfair but don't actually have a solution or better, correct, more fair idea in mind, things are ""problematic"". They have the aura of a problem. There's a whiff of trouble, a little stinky hint.John Lee Hancock's The Blind Side is problematic. The film stars Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw as the Tuohys, and Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher, their leviathan adopted son. The film is based on the book of the same name, which details in part the story of how Oher, abandoned by a crack-addict mother and homeless as a high-school sophomore, came to live with and be adopted by the blindingly white, incredibly rich Republican Tuohy family, who helped him eventually make it to the NFL as an offensive linesman.In the film as in reality, the NCAA had legitimate concerns about the Tuohy's actions re: Oher, suggesting that perhaps they, as massive boosters for Ole Miss football had taken him in and hired him a professional tutor in the hopes that they could convince him, prodigiously gifted as he was athletically, to play for their alma mater, which he eventually did. The film handles this question as if it were a legitimate puzzle, as if the actions of the Tuohys are beyond their own ken – Bullock's Leigh Ann asks her husband at one point, ""Am I a good person?"" Oher in the film is just as puzzled. He has no idea of their motivations, because he is an inarticulate mass, a giant silent looming prop, the obelisk against which the Tuohys can attempt to effect their idea of Christian charity. He's not quite Michael Clark Duncan's obsequious blubbering Magic Black Man from The Green Mile, but he's close enough. To the white, southern Tuohys, to his white coaches and teammates, he's an unfathomable, totemic, black force that might have been dredged up from the bottom of the ocean. What everyone does see, instantaneously, is that he is large, strong and fast, so they without even bothering to ask turn him into a football player. Leigh Ann is asked at one point in the film if what she's doing is out of white guilt, and it's clearly not. The film, though, is going to make a lot of guilty-feeling white people very happy. That's problematic.What rescues the film from complete collapse is the performance of Sandra Bullock. It's a rare gift for an actor to be able to do work that seems to be a conscious decision on the part of the performer to work to make the film better. Bullock's performance is not just razor-sharp and subtle, it seems calculated, it seems like she as an actress recognized the inherent problems in her character and in the way the film is put together and worked in her performance to correct those problems. Her performance is superb. In every scene in which the film could or would dip into maudlin sentimentality and pathetic white-people-saving-black-people (as long as they're athletic and will help the team full of white people win) sludge, she's a little frosted-haired scalpel, cutting through the dross. Unfortunately the film has scenes without her in it, and those are often terrible.Ultimately, the film does to Oher what the Tuohys did to him. He never speaks about his relationship with the family outside of a few pithy one-liners and smiles. He's never allowed to be articulate about his background, or goals, or disappointments. He's a prop moved around at will by people motivated by a weird combination of religious and athletic morality, a giant instinctual force, aimed by anyone but himself and unleashed. It's not quite offensive, I don't think, but it certainly is problematic. 4/10",1
"This is a dumbed down excuse of a movie. Honestly, I felt a physical assault on my brain cells. Obviously the producers are trying to target the Christian republican rednecks, who ironically, will probably not like it anyway. For the rest of us, it is simply unbearable to watch.I like Sandra Bullock. No I really do. But it is completely beyond me how she got an Oscar for such an awful movie. Is portraying a stereotypical character with corny lines worthy of an Oscar? Is delivering the clichés we've seen hundreds of times before worthy an Oscar? I feel sorry for my lost time watching this, although thankfully it was just on the plane, so I didn't pay a cent.",1
"This must be embarrassing for Mr. Oher to see. A movie that takes away his accomplishments and credits them all to his adoptive family.Michael has said himself that the movie Mis-portrayed how much he knew about football. By his account, he was already playing football when he met his adoptive family. While movies will understandably take certain liberties for the sake of telling a story fit for the theaters, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth knowing that Oher's own hard work is minimized in this movie. After all, this is based on Oher's life, and those who watch this movie will likely believe the story is as close to reality as the filmmakers could get.When you look at how near impossible it is for most people to become a pro athlete, and when you start to under the intense training, dieting, and studying of the game an athlete will have undergone to even be noticed by a league like the nfl, then taking that accomplishment away from the athlete is a tragedy. I enjoyed this movie as a kid for the underdog sports drama theme, but as an adult, can't help but think Oher deserved a much better movie about his life.",1
"The Blind Side finds a wealthy, white and paternalistic Christian family deciding to civilise a helpless, slow-witted, African American kid. The kid doesn't speak, is a kind, gentle bear, and spends the film literally doing whatever the white characters tell him to do, never once expression an opinion, thought or exhibiting any agency or free will. As the film unfolds, we are shown black people who are unable to help themselves, learn that the white man's way is best, that blacks should be grateful of white aid and that success comes to those who ""are good"" and ""don't do drugs"". The film tries to say that privileged whites should help downtrodden blacks, but of course this is easy to say when the black kid being helped turns out to be a star sportsman who effortlessly succeeds on the field. Strangely, ""The Blind Side's"" central character - Big Mike (Quinton Aaron) - is largely a non-entity. A giant mute kid, passive but obedient, Mike bumbles about like a tamed grizzly bear in a polo shirt. Elsewhere the film employs racist stereotypes, is condescending and has absolutely no concern for its black character, who plays second fiddle to actress Sandra Bullock, who plays a kindly matriarch with a hot-line to God. Through Bullock, white audiences pat themselves on the back, able to do what's right and decent by proxy.During flashbacks, Big Mike is shown to have come from a supremely depressing black community. Drug addicts, prostitutes, gangsters, junkies with hopeless lives....the kid's past is but an amalgamation of clichés, a one-dimensional horror-show cynically designed to make his transition into white-hood smooth and frictionless. A better film would have perhaps shown the troubles the kid has fitting into his new white life. Would have really examined the causes of poverty and abandonment. Would show how Bullock's very privilege relies on an unspoken social agreement which essentially perpetuates and sanctions an underclass. Would show how Big Mike feels being the only black kid in school. Would have given him a personality. Would have examined the way sports exploits impoverished black kids. Would have examined the downsides of the white family's Christian fundamentalism. Would have portrayed its characters in a less one-dimensional light (though the Aryan Brotherhood must be pleased to see the black mute gentle giant stereotype making a return).But perhaps such a film would have made no money. Afterall, ""Blind"" made a staggering 400 million dollars and counting at the box office, proving that people love its very Christian world-view. This is the wholesome view of smiley-faced missionaries who go out to Africa to help god's impoverished children with an open heart. A view which ignores the church's brutal history, its continuing negative effect on the continent (see the rise of brutal church sanctioned homophobia), ignores that for every dollar of western ""aid"" sent to Africa a dollar fifty and more comes back in debt repayment, ignores the way western ""Christian"" nations control trade policies and the lives of peoples in the developing world, never-mind how privilege at home in America relies upon a class system. And all the while, with demented irony, Jesus Christ's supposed home land of Israel, the site every crazy politician believes the Second Coming will occur, receives more western aid than all of Latin America, Africa and the West Indies combined. Hooray for a little Christian compassion.A more moral film would have probably had Big Mike beat the crap out of Bullock, embrace every racist cliché, get their daughter pregnant, rob their house and steal their car. I'm sure there's something in the Bible which advocates that. Thou shall enact vengeance on hypocritical women or something. Proverbs 21:19 I think. Or maybe not.7/10 – The always likable Sandra Bullock would win an Oscar for her performance in this film.",1
"The inspirational story of Michael Oher, the performance from Sandra Bullock, and the good camera work, so why did it not come together? I think the blame is on the screenplay. The overall portrayal of Michael Oher seems stylized in a way that never really shows the true grit or sentiment of the character. It is all so glamored up. Yet the messages of the movie still stay true and the performances are finely tuned, especially Bullock's. The racism displayed is reflective and correct. Ther are lots of things the filmmakers got right, but there are plenty they got wrong as well. The results are a serviceable portrait of a very honest and fortunate man that never adds up the way it should have.",1
"Boy, The Blind Side tried. It really did attempt to be a tear jerker.If it weren't for an interview I heard/saw from the real-life Michael Oher (played here by Aaron) who said barely a scene actually happened – stating most were for, well, dramatic effect, it still would fail at being 100% interesting.Oher's homeless after his druggie mother (of, like 15 kids she may/may not remember giving birth to) doesn't want anything to do with him, as are the other caretakers, he runs into stuck-up rich wife gal Leigh Anne (Bullock) and she takes him in. Showing she's not perfect, even she admits the first night, she worries a person of color will steal from (or harm) her family. Guess what? Oher ends up being someone decent, albeit reclusive and attaches himself to the rich family's kindness.Eventually he opens up, feels more safe and proves that football's his thing. So much, that the coincidentally ex-cheerleader mom encourages him further and then into a college scholarship. Throw in some outrageously Lifetime drama of a conflict on which school he chooses and you'll get the ""exciting"" climax of him making it big on his own terms.These all sound like complaints. And they're really not. This movie wasn't bad, per se, but not great. It tried too hard, way too hard for tears of the audience. I'll admit: it nearly got me in a few scenes.Unfortunately, before I could fully get emotional, the movie shifts gears and I'm back to watching a movie that should have, in fact, ended on the Lifetime Channel verses the big screen.The more I heard about Bullock's performance – Oscar worthy, they say, I had to see this movie. She was really good, I will say. The best? No. Great, even? Again, no. But really good. I believed every scene she was in as mother-of-the-week Leigh Anne Touhy. Was this her best performance? Or the best she could be? By no means, that's a negative. Heck, not only was she better in Speed, her absolute best job was in 2005's Crash, in which, she wasn't even nominated. Like Pacino, who onlyONLY for the love of Petewon an Oscar for one role (Scent of a Woman), Bullock will probably be recognized for The Blind Side, despite her being so much better in Crash. It's those old Oscar cronies way of making up for past mistakes, as they generally do.Was the movie worth watching? Sure. For the (waaay over used) great (based on, inspired by, etc) true FOOTBALL movies? Not really. If you're looking for that, look elsewhere. And having literally hundreds of the ""true"" football films come out in the past two+ decades, it shouldn't be hard to find. This one has basically one real football game scene and a few practices. It's more about overcoming prejudices, charity, the 'hood and, of course, Bullock's Oscar chances. See it, if everything else is sold out.SIDE NOTE: Like many other ""TRUE STORIES"" that use a tremendous amount of unrealistic but dramatic scenes that, for the most part, are entered in to move the story along to fit in years of lives in mere hours, The Blind Side hit a nerve with me. In one of the key plot points, the young boy of the Touhy family (Head) films all of Oher's football practices and games. He eventually sends a copy to the recruiter's office and from there, every single, and I mean EVERYONE of the, recruiting colleges/universities want this rather large soon-to-be football player. Here's my petpeeve: Though I know, once again, these types of movies thrive on the heavy drama (to make us weep!) and have to get the job done in under 3 hours (short attention span, audience, eh?) they cut corners with extreme amateur videos (the boy was about 10) that are professionally made. For example, he's completely stationary yet, the film follows the action on the field, namely Oher. Not only did this type of filming never occur, it was extremely hard to buy the recruiters sitting back, laughing, high-fiving their way to dollar-signs in their eyes due to the ""excellent footage"" they're witnessing on their monitors. Give me a freaking break.",1
"I just saw The Blind Side last night. As I have read even if you are not a football fan you'll like this movie. I am not a football fan (baseball is my sport) but I loved it!!! So many great performances by the actors. A charming story with laughs and tears. How nice to have a positive movie this time of the year especially. Everybody MUST see this movie. Quinton Aaron does a fantastic job of playing Michael Oher. In the early scenes he has no dialog, but expresses so much just with is eyes and facial expressions. Jae Head is charming as the young ""brother"" S.J. Camped up I am sure, but I go to the movies to entertained which the movie does in spades! Sandra Bullock as I have never seen her before, does a wonderful job, so different that the other roles she has had in the past. And Ray McKinnon as the coach has some expressions that John Lee Hancock should be awarded for his direction.",1
"I've discovered that you certainly don't have to be black to be offended and insulted by the candy-coated fable ""The Blind Side"". As I watched I couldn't help but be reminded of ""Harry And The Hendersons"", but with a decidedly racist slant, although in the movie's defense, I don't feel it was deliberate. All the same, this feel-good movie is the type of Hollywood production that blacks have justifiably railed against since ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"", and rightfully so.Here we have a privileged pretty princess (Bullock) and her pretty McMansion-ensconced family bestowing not just aid but outright salvation itself on a poor and essentially homeless black ""child"". Aside from some blips generated by the skeptical raised eyebrows of the NCAA, all the future is happiness for everyone involved....The End. I freely admit I possess a low threshold for ""cute"", and the family's precocious wise-beyond-his-years young son seemed to single-handedly tip this film into the Oh-Give-Me-A-Break ditch. He seemed to be a character lifted out of a laugh-tracked cookie-cutter '80's family sitcom. Is this how far we've come? AND...What is the wonderful Kathy Bates doing in this film??There were also a few peripheral yet potent loose strings for which resolutions were never presented (the central character's drug-addicted mother and estranged brother, for example). We get to meet them, or at least become aware of them. But it seems the message we're left to assume is that, since they don't have their own Nice White Lady to rescue them, they don't have any real chance at redemption, so there's really no point in hearing from them again. Feel-good movies never leave such untidiness! Since ""The Blind Side"" is based on true events, the real-life people these actors endeavor to portray deserve better that this icky sweet confection.",1
"I do not give out ratings of 10 lightly, but here it is - the first film in years that has been deserving of the rating.Neill Blomkamp brings to screens a fantastic, gritty, realistic piece of science fiction with District 9. Not since Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"", John Carpenter's ""The Thing"", or James Cameron's ""Aliens"" have we seen a science fiction film with a vision of this caliber. After viewing District 9, it will be clear to one and all why Peter Jackson put so much faith in Blomkamp and took him under his wing as protégé.Abandoning the usual settings of Hollywood sci-fi and placing us in the harsh slums of South Africa, we are given an original piece of work which takes risks in the way it tells its story. Not only does it go against the expectations of audiences who have been trained to expect mediocrity from their sci-fi, it goes above and beyond the call of duty to provide us with spectacle as well as something to ponder after we've downed our popcorn.There is, thankfully, not an overused, overexposed celebrity in sight, and every unknown face in the film gives a solid performance. The aliens themselves, brilliantly realized with top notch CGI even manage to make us feel something, only rivaled by Gollum from ""Lord of the Rings"".District 9 has so much to like. It's spectacular, darkly funny, entertaining and thoughtful all at the same time, and it's all done on a meager $30m budget. There is true talent on show here. If only there were more films like this, the world of cinema would be a more interesting place.",1
"This is such an incredibly weird movie that I am not even sure if I can adequately describe it, but I'll try. The film is, through the first half, a mockumentary about a problematic alien problem that will supposedly be happening in the near future. In 2010, an alien ship appears over Johannesburg and just hovers there. When humans eventually decide to cut through the hull, they find the ship packed with over a million aliens--aliens that are starving and look like giant bugs. Well, there seems to be no one in charge and they all are apparently workers who have no real purpose other than to work. When the UN decides to finally do something about it, the aliens are herded into a giant ghetto like those used during apartheid. And, for the most part, they are reviled or exploited--and kept as a permanent underclass.The film mostly centers around a rather dim civil servant, Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley). He is the leader of an organization sent in to move the bugs to a new facility that also totally sucks--but is away from the humans--who have come to totally distrust and hate them. But, in the process he accidentally infects himself...and where this goes next is just amazingly weird! And, once infected, the film stops being a mockumentary and follows his new life as a wanted man. Why is he wanted, who wants him and what this is all about is just too much for this short review--really.So let's talk about the film. I used to think that movies like ""Happiness of the Katakuris"", ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World"" and ""Delicatessen"" were weird films, but ""District 9"" clearly sets a new standard for weird and creative. You simply cannot find anything like it--and it's wonderful to find a film that is this unique. Plus, like good sci-fi, this one is a great allegory with deeper contemporary meaning--with a lot to say about us screwed up humans! By the way, this movie is rated-R and it clearly deserves this. The language is very, very rough but the film is also very gross--with lots of blood, guys, vomiting and the like. It is NOT for a person with a weak stomach or children...seriously...do NOT let the kids see this one! Because of this, although I loved this film and was blown away by it, I also cannot see it as a perfect film--hence my not giving it a 10. It's just unnecessarily adult when it could have been a great film for a much wider audience.",1
"Everyone's seen the trailer that kick-started one very fishy-looking viral campaign, interviewing several humans and an alien in quick succession. That marks many people's first exposure to Neill Blomkamp's District 9, and the trailer - which had a decently executed ""mockumentary"" feel to it, which only served to make its sci-fi content seem even more surprising. This same element of surprise is still present throughout the film proper, and it is quite a cinematic treat.District 9 takes place in an alternate timeline where, twenty years ago, an alien spaceship came to a halt above the city of Johannesburg. The inhabitants of the ship are unable to operate the ship anymore, so they end up being segregrated to their own slum within the city below. Eventually, the government calls for the eviction of the aliens (nicknamed ""prawns"" due to their appearance) from the slum. The film's ostensible protagonist is Wikus (Sharlto Copley), who through a series of events too complicated to recount in a synopsis, ends up undergoing some rather dramatic changes and before long he's thrust into the middle of something far too big for him to handle...The best thing about District 9 is that it always manages to stay fresh and surprising throughout. As the trailers indicate, it starts off as a mockumentary in order to expose the gist of the story. The film gradually crosses over to being a more conventional film, although still filmed with a very documentarian look and interspersed with occasional news footage or interviews. Despite the unexpected change in presentation, you don't really notice because you're so wrapped up in the ingenious premise. Then you're presented with the plight of Wikus, whose story is one I don't really want to expose too much because watching it all unfold was just amazing to watch. He's a perfect example of the Everyman, trying to survive as best he can in the face of everything that the world throws at him over the course of the film. His development, along with that Chris, the prawn he befriends (who is surprisingly well-rounded for a CGI character) raises this above your average science-fiction film. Even when the film's final third act becomes incredibly action-packed, it still doesn't jar with the mood of the film and doesn't forsake its characters and intelligence for the sake of cheap action sequences.On that subject, the action sequences are far from ""cheap"". Given that Blomkamp and collaborator Peter Jackson were originally aiming to make a film adaptation of Halo before changing to this, there's still plenty of moments that feel quite reminiscent of Bungie's game, from the alien technology to the frantic battles. The effects work looks great in even the simplest of situations, to say nothing of the bombastic finale. There's just something about the way it all comes together, especially when it is combined with one very uncompromising storyline and subject.District 9 is a rare find nowadays. It doesn't sacrifice the intelligence or raw power that its story affords it for the sake of appeasing your ""typical"" blockbuster crowd with a lighter rating and less focus on the story. It's a damned fine thriller that is not without its flaws, but is still several cuts above your average summer film and is well worth watching - but only if you can handle the heat. And it does get quite hot.",1
"Going into the cinema I had mixed expectations as I only saw a handful (yet interesting) posters and only one trailer. I only heard a handful of reviews yet all of them came from this site. Well, I decided to hedge my bets and walk in anyway. And I'm glad I did.""District 9"" is a wallop of a film that is also one of the year's very best films. It perfectly presents the balance of human emotions and CGI mastery. The acting is top notch and believable, and the characters are so realistically presented; even the protagonist is deeply flawed, and during some scenes I wonder who should I root for.The story is well told; a refreshing, unique and somewhat original scenario, one that we've never experienced for quite some time. The atmosphere is bleak, dark and realistic, actually making me believe this thing can actually happen here on Earth.The special effects are excellently rendered, and actually give more than their money's worth (Only US$ 30 million! And the effects were amazing, as great as anything WETA has done before!). The creature effects are so realistic we could not tell the difference. Thanks to none other than WETA for this amazing feat, and I hope they get an Oscar for visual effects. But the practical effects are believable too, as per the engaging and thrilling (and also non-stop) action sequences in the film's second half. And boy, those weapons are awesome! Special mention goes out to the fluid editing. Example, first half of the film works like a docu-drama, and the second half becomes a hybrid of Black Hawk Down, and we don't notice the change of pace. It's that brilliant.Peter Jackson really knows how to pick a good story and director when he sees one. And I want to shake Neill Blommkamp's hand if I meet him. He is certainly a talented director, and one to look out for in the future. (P.S. If that Halo movie is still going on, Blommkamp has proved that he is the man for the job) In short, it's an excellent science fiction action film, but not without it's intelligence. It may have a few flaws and very few clichés (these happen near the end of the film) but it is still very solid nonetheless. If there is a sequel, I'll be first in line to see it.Overall value: 8.5/10",1
"Sci-fi has been in a bit of a rut in Hollywood so it's refreshing to see this South African take on the genre. Here, aliens are subject to apartheid and the film's ""hero"" is a guy committed to driving them away from mankind. The lead character is one of my biggest problems with the film. He's a jerk, and his redemption comes way too late in the proceedings. It should have come after his first escape, but even at the climax he's still acting like a jerk. The actor's fine, it's just the horrible character we're saddled with that rankles me.Still, the film's look and polish is spot on. It's done up to look low budget, with hand cameras and the like, and this makes the presence of the aliens all the more remarkable. Truly, these are the best CGI creations I've ever seen. They live and breath on the screen in a way that surpasses even Gollum and the lead alien guy is my favourite character in the film.Things begin quite slowly but pick up once the main character is exposed to some alien fluid. From there on in there are references to Cronenberg's THE FLY and other films but DISTRICT 9 retains its own individuality and flavour. There are some big, brutal battle scenes which are a lot of fun and an impressive military climax in which all manner of robots and weapons are used to destroy humans, vehicles and buildings. By the end, I was thoroughly entertained by the film – especially as it was the first blu-ray disc I watched on my new player.",1
"From PASTO, COLOMBIA-Via: L. A. CA; CALI, Colombia+ORLANDO, FLThe ONLY TONY KISS CASTILLO on FaceBook!------------------------In fact, it would be, unequivocally, one of his all-time favorites. Regrettably, Mr. Kafka is unable to make his case...So, I will try to make it for him. How do you say ""WOW!"" in Czech? First, let's touch upon the obvious. Hollywood says: ""100 million, bargain basement, to make an epic film!"" South Africa says: ""30 million!"". District 9 is an intricately crafted, intensely hypnotic, cinematic collage of numerous disparate elements. The film itself seems to go through several different stages of metamorphosis.Initial minutes of the movie have an authoritative, documentary or docudrama feel. Gradually, District 9 transitions into a socio-cultural Sci-Fi drama, adding a totally new dimension to the term ""Apartheid""! Next, it's more of a gripping police thriller. The last 15 or 20 minutes are non-stop, adrenaline-pumping action! None of these shifts are awkward or contrived in the least; they flow and mesh quite seamlessly and naturally. District 9 is made to order for those of us who crave Sci-Fi epics with unique, original, character driven stories; something light-years removed from same old, same old contrivances and clichéd conventions.Mr. Kafka might ponder, ""What is one of the key questions put forth by many of the best movies?"" How about, ""Precisely what qualities make a being human?"" Solidarity, loyalty, respect for others and other sentient creatures, empathy, sympathy and the ability to suppress personal short-term goals for long term ones beneficial to the group, are all important traits that come to mind. Think, ""2001"", ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""The Elephant Man"". After seeing District 9, you will have to decide for yourself who the REAL humans are!10********** ...... ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are most welcome!",1
"District 9 is a film I was lucky enough to see in the theater when it first released. The marketing for the movie was remarkably good, posters everywhere meant that before you even entered the theater, you had already been primed to see the ""Prawns"" as a nuisance, larger and stronger than humans, and probably best kept at a distance. The film's opening and narrative bookends being from the perspective of a documentary of news crew meant that everything felt very lifelike when you saw ads running on TV. As a Sci-fi lover, my interest was primed and pumping as I bought my ticket.Now, 10 years later, my love for this movie is not as strong and has shifted from my previous reasons for liking it, but nevertheless, this is a film I expect will remain on my shelf for years to come.""District 9"" wowed me in the beginning for many reasons. The first one out of the gate that grabs you is the world building. There are hosts of movies that take similar tacks when it comes to informing the audience about the history or rules of a fantasy, sci-fi, or just slightly left of real, world. Relate everything through news stories that play in the background or are featured in scenes that inform everyone as to what is going on. In fact, this approach is so common that it is considered a crutch by many filmmakers and is classically made fun of in the brilliant ""Shaun of the Dead""It is truly rare to find films which spin a tried and maybe tired device into something fresh and even featured as a part of their film but Neill Blomkamp delivers a fresh look at documentary news coverage as exposition that simply stunned. Not only does the footage seem real, immersive, and present important concepts to audiences, it does so in a way that they are used to receiving information so that when they are presented with personal stories that contradict the news coverage, it causes them to ask questions about those same sorts of stories in their own lives, but more about that later.The next thing that stood out about the film was the performance of Sharlto Copley (""Chappie"") which, essentially, launched his international career. One of the most difficult tasks that a writer, director, or actor faces is to make relatable that which is unrelatable. Taking a character like Wikus, who is blind to his prejudice, complicit activities, and general willful ignorance and turn him into someone for whom we have genuine empathy is the essential role of an artist. To not hide from the way that Wikus allows himself to be stupidly used in the beginning of the film and give him a journey which confronts him with the horrific results of his apathy in a way that leaves us hoping for better for him is the essence of good acting and I say Bravura to Copley for his performance.The reason that I highlight these two aspects of the film is because they are what I find to be essentially brilliant about the film, yet also what was lost on me about it ten years ago. With the way the film tells its story in two ways: through high level news; stories, documentary footage, and interviews with family and friends of Wikus; as well as on the ground personal interactions; between Wikus and his coworkers, the company, his family, and the Prawns; we end up getting the story from two perspectives.As a young man, I wasn't asking myself the questions I now ask myself so I only saw the interesting story, the horror of realizing something alien is happening to you, and the thrill of some impressive action sequences especially considering the budget. As an older man I realize that while the film is about these things on the surface, it is also about the difference between what we receive through screens, second hand accounts, and media outlets, as opposed to that which we experience personally.The film is about perception, propaganda, prejudice, and personal connection. It is about what is real and what is not. Questions like this continue to be begged more and more as our world becomes more saturated, debate if you will for good or ill, with screens, vlogs, stories, commercials, news stories, reality shows, and everything in between. ""District 9"" is a reminder that while our world has gotten wider with the advent of new technologies there is always the threat that it may not get deeper as it grows in breadth. We must remember that the tactile person to person contact which is the enemy of prejudice requires us to seek specifically for the individual and to see them for who they are as an individual and not just what group they belong to.The Prawn in this film is a stand in for all of the things we fear at a knee's jerk whether it is the immigrant, refugee, Muslim, Jew, Christian, Communist, Fascist, Snowflake, or Boomer. May we all seek to understand each other more despite the efforts of the powerful to shape our understanding through media.",1
"I have to admit I was sucked in by the TV commercials for this movie. I wasn't disappointed. It didn't take long to link the events of this film with the realities of many parts of our world. The aliens are the oppressed, and, realistically, the earthlings have interned them in camps and allowed them to create a dystopic society. They feast and are feasted upon by the exploiters. Like the Native-Americans and many other disenfranchised creatures, they have become a nuisance, and the society that is treating them so badly is now going to move them to a ""more convenient"" place. An overzealous public official, the central figure in the movie, gets his jollies by treating the aliens as if they were non-sentient creatures. He does a Steve Irwin kind of commentary as he invades their homes and tries to get them to agree to their relocation. He is so cocky that he doesn't realize that swipe from one these beings could cut him in half. In his stupid recklessness, he infects himself with an alien canister and begins to transform into one of them. The strength of this movie, however, is the ""humanity"" of the aliens. They have personalities. They are not bugs, though they look like them. They love, they fight, they survive in horrid conditions. This is a very complex movie that doesn't go for the cheap thrill, although it does occasionally go too much to the special effects and predictable battle scenes.",1
"District 9 is a story about aliens who make contact with Earth and the relationships with humans and society. The creatures were set up in a makeshift home in South Africa's District 9. Control over the aliens has been contracted out to Multi-National United (MNU), a private company uninterested in the aliens' welfare. Their sole interest, alien technology and weapons. Weapon research would mean huge profits for the company. Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is placed in charge of the filed operation to evict, remove, and place the aliens in a new holding facility. Conflict and tension threaten the operation as agents move in. Don't be fooled. This isn't your typical alien sci-fi action movie. What got me was the believability. If there were aliens out there that were able to make contact with Earth, it seems it could have gone something like this. The way the perspective switches from mock documentary style to standard third person certainly contributes to it. ""Real"" news footage and interviewers tell the story in retrospect, as the events of the movie have already occurred when they are being interviewed. I think it all added to the realism of the experience. Usually in these type of films, it's mostly mindless action and the story is lost. Not the case here. There's so much more to it. It's also about betrayal, loyalty, trust, relationships, and sacrifice. It can actually be pretty deep and thought provoking with many themes floating around. The film's really about the story which is really a fresh, gritty, original concept, which is good to see nowadays. While the creatures can be most readily described as monsters, though they are like us. Family and friendship are still important ideals in their world. The film explores a fine line between human emotions and monsters. With all the selfishness, hatred, and greed within us, maybe we are the real monsters or at least that's how it can be perceived. Neill Blomkamp does a tremendous job with the direction and realism of the film. Sharlto Copley blew me away. I was shocked to see this was his first acting role. The action sequences were well done as well. District 9 is a very unique sci-fi film, one that shouldn't be missed. Mind you, this isn't a film for everyone. It's violent, and many parts can be cringe worthy. Be warned but be ready for one of the best films of the year thus far.",1
"In 1982 a spaceship appears over Johannesburg, South Africa. They find an alien population of ""Prawns"" and put them in a concentration camp called District 9. After 20 years, the local population has had enough of the aliens and plan to relocate the aliens to a location far away. Wikus van der Merwe is a meek bureaucrat who is given charge to organize the relocation plan by private corporation MNU. District 9 has become a vast lawless place with alien technologies. While rounding up the Prawns and getting signatures on paperwork, Wikus is infected with something that is slowly morphing him into the alien.What an amazing debut effort from director/writer Neill Blomkamp. It is richly original and so very human. It uses the documentary style to elevate its realism. The CGI Prawns are brilliantly grotesque without being a ridiculous horror. Wikus is such a wonderful comedic character. It is a scathing indictment of the treatment of the disenfranchised. The movie works on so many different levels. It is audacious beyond anything a big Hollywood blockbuster should be.",1
"But don't let that stop you from jumping into it. It's an excellent film. Funny, suspenseful & engaging. Highly recommended for lovers of science fiction. Definately worthy of repeat viewing. C'mon though gang, WHERE'S THE SEQUEL!?",1
"This movie different from the rest of the Alien movies. Though the gross awful looking aliens creeps me out most of the time at but that doesn't distract me from enjoying this the unique story. It kept at the edge of the seat whole time. It surprises, saddens, and amazes me at the same time. I never imagined this movie would end in this way.",1
"I caught an early screening of this movie last night. I went into it with high expectations considering the high ratings it has been getting already. My expectations were not high enough however because this film exceeded my them in every way possible.I will not go far into detail because I would prefer to not spoil anything. This is unlike any sci-fi we have seen in years. Forget Terminator 3 and 4, forget the AVP movies, forget all those laughable sci-fi movies, this film is what we have been waiting for. An original idea, an original concept, brilliantly executed, great CGI, good acting, it just has it all. We have seen many aliens come to earth movies, but this is different, I will not say why though. That is for you to find out when you see it, which I HIGHLY recommend you do.This movie, quality-wise, matches up with the popular Sci-Fi films we love. The original Alien, the original Predator, The Matrix, Star Wars, etc. While I enjoyed those ones more because they are classics, this one clearly meets the standards we expect today when it comes to quality. A big driving force behind this, in my opinion, is the fact that high esteemed Peter Jackson is behind this project as the producer. After seeing his masterful Lord of the Rings saga, anyone can see that he knows what he is doing.As far as movies for this year, this is definitely top 5 so far on my list (Up, Star Trek, 500 Days of Summer, HP6, and District 9). Thank you Jackson and Hollywood for finally producing the best Sci-Fi in years. If this movie does not make its way to IMDb top 250 then I will be in awe.See this movie!",1
"Saying this movie is good would be an understatement. The movie has it all, a very intriguing deep plot, good acting and great action. If I was to find a flaw in this movie, it would be the shaky cam technique employed at the beginning part of the movie and also at the very end. The shaky parts are supposedly documentary clips telling the story of Wikus, the protagonist. But rather than add to the feel of it, the shakiness is just nauseating. They just over did it. But after a while into the movie, they got out of the documentary mode and things couldn't be any better. And the special effects in his movie will have you believing that these aliens are real.It's better that you go into this movie not knowing the deeper plot as a big part of the movie's entertainment value for me is the parts when things look hopeless and you really feel the despair and hopelessness of the characters. The only thing you need to know going in is that there are aliens stranded on earth and they are put in slums. This is one of those movies that teases you that it's nearing its end, but inside, you go ""No, I want more. It can't end like this"", and the movie hears you and gives you more. And it's primed for a great sequel. The potential that this franchise has is just enormous. The way they can expand the story is just limitless and all of them can add to it's lore. This is a classic franchise in the making.",1
"Ever since Neill Blomkamp was lined to do the film version of the ""Halo"" video game, he's become a household name with the fanboys. But as we all know, that project stalled and Blomkamp is no longer on board as a director. After that happened, Peter Jackson gave Blomkamp $30 million to make whatever movie he wanted. Blomkamp made this film, and it is a stunning debut.Normally I despise remakes, but after viewing Blomkamp's short film, ""Alive in Joburg,"" which served as the inspiration for this movie, I can say that calling ""District 9"" a remake of the short film is about as untrue as it is unfair. Even saying that Blomkamp used the short film as a jumping off point is pushing it (a lot). ""District 9"" takes the idea and runs with it, not even remembering to pass ""Go"" and collect 200 dollars.South Africa, present day. A spaceship has been hovering over Johannesburg, South Africa, for the past 20 or so years. The aliens were brought down and nourished back to health, but people's apprehension with the new beings caused major clashes, and the visitors, known as ""prawns"" were moved into a slum called District 9. Today, the shady corporation Multi-National United has decided to move the prawns to District 10, and to make sure that it's handled legally, they enlist Wikus Van Der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) to oversee it. Suffice it to say, things don't go as planned.""District 9"" is not flawless, but it's so good that I'm more than willing to look the other way at any of its ""flaws."" But the best part of it is that it takes chances. In broad strokes, the story is familiar, but the details and execution are completely new.One of the best things that I liked is how Blomkamp portrays people reacting to the aliens. Everything that the people do in response to them is completely credible. I don't want to give anything away, but the way that the people ""acted"" in response to the coming of the prawns is so believable it's almost chilling. ""Interviews"" with people who worked with Wikus and were involved in the story enhance this effect.Meanwhile, we have Wikus guiding us through the story. Wikus is eager, but he's not the brightest bulb in the bunch. Sharlto Copley is excellent as Wikus. Copley does a great job playing a poster boy for MNU, but Wikus is also likable, and that's important.""District 9"" is a mixture of a million ideas all thrown together at once. Past movies have done this and sunk because of it, but ""District 9"" succeeds because they're competently explained and portrayed. A few technical things cause this to get an 8 instead of a 10 (for example, one scene is interesting, but it's out of place, and the film's big transition doesn't go very well), but it's still a highly recommendable film. And for once, the shaking camera is used effectively.Do I think that Blomkamp should direct ""Halo?"" While there's no question that he could do it, and make a great movie out of the game, I don't think he's the right man for the job. I don't think ""Halo"" would look good as a grainy documentary. But that's just me.",1
"Short, it is a film who must see it. For so many reasons than it escapes of any explanation. It is a Sci. Fi. and an action film and it propose a touching story. But it has, as basic virtue, the science to present the near reality in the most inspired manner. That defines it as one of films who are , in same measure, bitter and gentle and impecable work. It is a pledge. Foor a lot of causes. But, more important, it is a simple story of an ordinary man changing everything. A film about noble courage. Almost, wise use of an old fashion recipe. In fact, a great film. In few scenes, the film who you expect from a long, long time.",1
"District 9 is a movie to think about. The first (and second) time I watched District 9, I wasn't quite sure what to think. I came at it from the p.o.v. of a science fiction fan, and I thought some of the SF elements were not entirely thought through. But I thought some more about it, and things started to gel.Movies have been made before that people thought were about racism. I'm thinking of a brilliant film like Pleasantville, which on the face of it seems to be about race, but was much more complex underneath that surface. And I'm thinking of another brilliant 1998 film like Bulworth, where race was used to symbolize rich and poor. District 9, at first, seems not simply to be about race, but about xenophobia generally, and the plight of refugees especially. Penetrating deeper, this appearance however, while effective and admirable, is also deceptive. District 9 is one film that actually IS about racism. This is a South African film. The aliens in it arrived 28 years ago, when the inhuman Apartheid system was still in effect.So what is this film saying? Get this: It is using aliens to explain to us that there is still effective Apartheid in South Africa today. The aliens symbolize the black South Africans, and how they are still ostracized from much of common/white society and kept in crime-infested and corruption-ridden areas. Having no future and no hope and no voice. That's also why, in the film, the Nigerians are Nigerians - they couldn't be South Africans, because the *aliens* are the South Africans.The bio-fluid used to power the space-ship represents the life-force and will to live that the black South Africans have lost. In the film, it must be the catastrophic loss of almost all their bio-fluid that led to the big ship's crash in the first place, and to the poor condition of the aliens inside it. The alien technology represents cultural substance; it is a beautiful symbol of all that we have to learn from so-called primitive cultures. If we'll open up to their problems and cultural content, we will all be the richer for it.Even the documentary form of the first part of the film also makes proper sense in light of this interpretation. The documentary part is supposed to make the audience identify with the whites, whereas when the documentary style of storytelling disappears, the audience is left free to choose a different allegiance. In other words, we start by being shown that *we* are the ones at fault, and then we are given the opportunity to change.This is a brilliant film. I rate it 10 stars out of 10.",1
Seriously - I'd rather get hit by a train than watch this garbage. The only reason this got watched in the first place is because of the snow storm that came through. I should of known better..... please do anything else with your time..... go watch grass grown or paint dry.... It will be so much more entertaining.,0
"In this movie what at first, I thought it was a comedy, a police detective and a book writer date each other and compete who will find the killer of her sister. The writer's book must be as lousy as Brazen's script, as discussed at their first date. Anyhow, the killer is pretty obvious from the beginning, but it takes a whole movie for them to find out. Funnily enough, the police captain allows the random writer to participate to the police investigations.Actually, it is a very good movie (hence the 3 stars) to put on the background when you do something else, as you can check it out anytime and you haven't missed anything (as I said, you probably know the killer from the first 15 minutes).",0
"First, I want to say it's very unfair that so many of the negative reviews for this movie are based on the lead actor's personal politics, because the reality is this movie deserves to be judged on just how truly awful it is and we can also be pretty sure the people who hate Milano didn't watch the movie to begin with.What this movie does is give some wooden acting and cheap production and direction to an already cliched and unoriginal story by a pretty mediocre romance novelist. Everything about this plot is cookie cutter. I had to hold back the laughter when Grace was talking to the detectives and said one of the suspects was her former brother-in-law, Jonathan Breezewood ""the third."" ""He's a bigshot attorney,"" Grace said. Keep in mind, this character is supposed to be a famous author herself. What self-respecting writer would use such a hackneyed phrase?So the murdered sister was a teacher who had a secret second job as a webcam model. Gee, how original. And her ex-husband whom she was in a custody battle with was a suspect. Again, snore. And then of course one of her students who was a slightly awkward literature nerd happened to have a special interest in her. Is this a movie script or a mad libs exercise?One of my favorite scenes (before I got too bored to keep watching) was when the detectives went to visit the corporate office of the website she was modeling on and meet with the CEO to ask questions about her clients. First, let's acknowledge how stupid it is that the OnlyFans-like website she was using just happens to be headquartered in the same town she lived in. Now add on how stupid it is that detectives would talk to a corporate executive to try to get information about who the woman's subscribers (which the movie calls clients) were. This is simply not how an investigation like this would work at all in the real world. They would most likely have to subpoena that information or at the very least get it from a low-level security employee, not the CEO. It's how a very simple-minded or purely unmotivated person would write it though. And the best part of the scene is that the CEO's office walls are covered in giant TVs that are supposed to be showing a bunch of different models live streaming, but if you look for even a second you'll realize all the screens are showing the same 10-second loops over and over again. Do they really think the CEO of OnlyFans has dozens of screens streaming porn going on at all times in their office?I rarely stop a movie after I've started it, but this one was just trash. It doesn't even have the cheesy, campy entertainment factor of similar Lifetime and Hallmark movies. It's just a dreary, stupid, pointless waste of time.",0
I can't even call this movie bad that's a compliment it's such pure drivel there is no plot the actors? Wooden isn't even an adjective for them IDK Netflix keeps on getting worse and worse and they spend so much money on a lot of this I don't get it but Really in the past two weeks except for a rare exception of the ones that win awards 1 or 2 a year the rest is really really getting bad oh btw I understand Now why Alyssa Milano when she makes her remarks on Twitter is always asked who need your opinion you can't even master your own profession?? Awful.,0
This movie is a complete failure from beginning to end. The adaptation is bad. The directing is bad. The acting is bad. Not sure any actor could have made this better but Milano's acting was super bad. The money spent on this movie could have well went to a more worthy cause. Netflix certainly won't win any good recognition. With this one.,0
This movie has convinced me that Netflix lies about who gets on their top 10 list. This movie has a terrible plot and mediocre cast- your average lifetime movie is 10x better. Don't watch unless you're looking for mess.,0
"I really do like Alyssa Milano. And I say that although I am not always agreeing on what or how she says things in public. That being said, everyone is entitled to their opinion and it would be mad if we all thought and felt the same.The acting is ok I reckon, but the movie is as predictable as they come. Alyssa plays someone close to her heart, powerful, driven and woke - as in fighting inequality and all that jazz. Now that is more than a noble cause and her character is one that we should celebrate I suppose ... yet, she comes off as annoying to most and even when she has the upper hand and should be superior (against an ""evil"" man) ... he is almost more sympathetic than she is ... which is insane considering he is painted as bad Dude.Anyway, the movie has quite a few cliches, tries to be sizzling too, but never achieves any goals it sets out to do.",0
Now we understand why Netflix increased subscription rates.Overall the best part of the film is the cherry blossoms.Overall we can easily rate cast script acting stupidity waste of money talentlessness costumes hair all on the same level - so consistency is it's redeeming feature.May I suggest you don't attempt to compare it with Gone With The Wind Casablanca Some Like It Hot or any Hitchcock filmFor film students a lesson in not what to make what to avoid and the ridiculous.,0
"One would think... having the acting record like Alyssa Milano has had (being the person who basically helped pioneer the #metoo movement on Twitter too btw), that would surely help put her in better films than this... apparently I'm wrong.I found this to be another Netflix ""Hallmark-y""-type drama that had no point whatsoever in making except to give those involved a paycheck.HORRIBLE ending. So basically... all is JUST FINE after KILLING a TEENAGER?! No follow up after that AT ALL?!? I can't you guys, I just can't.Nora Roberts is a decent writer for fans of this genre but I hope she didn't help green-light this dumpster-fire of a film. VERY disappointed.",0
"I know that my review is going to get many disagreements (down votes) but I'm going to say anyway because I want to write what I feel in honest way.Before I watched this film, I happened to read some of reviews and also the rating. Most of the reviews are saying that this film is totally bad and the rating is just 3.9 which is a bit lower than normal. So, I watched it to know how bad it is.After I watched it, I found out that it wasn't that bad after all. The story is kind of good. A little bit of mystery. But I must admit what some people were saying is right. The acting is kind of not that good. I feel like their acting is not sincere. It's like it's not coming from the heart, not serious. It's like they are not taking seriously. A little bit like child play. Just like that. But I've seen the worst. So, I think this kind of acting isn't that bad.It seems to me that this film is made with low budget. I'm not saying it's low budget because there aren't famous actors and all. I'm saying that it seemed to be low budget film. The quality is a bit low. So, if they've put more effort to it, it might turn out to be a good one.Right now, this film isn't a good one, but it isn't a bad one either. It's kind of enjoyable for one time watch.",0
"True to its title, 'The Apparition' arrives almost too quietly in cinemas this week – though rather than being a marketing gimmick like how the first 'Paranormal Activity' built its cult status, there is a much more straightforward reason why this low-budget B-grade horror flick has come without any fanfare. It is flat out bad, no less than bottom of the barrel stuff, even if you approach it with the kind of lowered standards you typically take to such fly-by-night productions from Joel Silver's Dark Castle Entertainment or Sam Raimi's Ghost House Pictures. Indeed, it is from the former that this first-time feature by writer/director Todd Lincoln hails from, and suffice to say that despite being bestowed the rare honour of shouldering dual responsibilities on this film, it is unlikely that Lincoln will find himself with similar luck soon. His 'Apparition' shows none of the ingenuity or even coherence of Oren Peli's 'Paranormal Activity', one of the few horror classics that he tries to emulate in the course of a muddled and practically nonexistent plot. After setting the scene with a 1970s séance experiment where a group of researchers used their minds to conjure the spirit of a lost colleague back into this world, the film opens with a similar procedure carried out by three amateur parapsychology students - Patrick (Tom Felton), Ben (Sebastian Stan), and Lydia (Julianna Guill). Successful they may have been, their efforts have opened a portal for a spirit to grab Lydia back into the netherworld. Fast forward four years later, and the story picks up with Ben moving into a new house with his current girlfriend Kelly (Ashley Greene). Playing like a teen friendly version of 'Paranormal Activity', strange occurrences start happening around their home, including the obligatory flickering lights, shadows in the dark and moving furniture. Then Lincoln remembers a certain horror movie he watched called 'Dark Water', and the said apparition begins appearing as a black mouldy patch on the ceilings and below the linoleum floors. Further on, Lincoln recalls 'Ju- On' and the apparition turns into a black-skinned long-haired girl moving on all fours. But more frustrating than its derivativeness is how lethargic the whole affair is. Never once do you feel that the threat to Kelly or Ben is real, nor in fact do you care for their predicament. That's partly because Lincoln doesn't know how to build tension even with a brief 75 minutes running time (sans the protracted end credits), and partly because the actors involved look plain uninvolved. And really how do you identify with characters who spout lines as inane as – ""Our house is too new to be haunted. It has no history."" – or the utter obvious like – ""Your house isn't haunted. You are.""? It is also too daft to realise its own stupidity, pretending to be much smarter than it really is by reintroducing science into the mix about half an hour before the picture's end with a lot of mambo-jumbo about electromagnetic waves and reversing polarity. In truth, the science in the movie is bullshit, and the more it tries to act intelligent about it, the sillier it comes off. Finally, when it has one of its characters Patrick urgently say that the apparition is some entity even older and more sinister than demons, you know that it is just grabbing at straws to try to reinstate its credibility. The only consolation you get is that its ending is as terrible as you expect it to – since the rest of movie is already that atrocious, no climax however bad can be considered a copout. No wonder then that 'The Apparition' has emerged like a ghost into theatres, without publicity and without any press previews. It has but one aim – to lure unsuspecting moviegoers hoping to have a ghost of a scare before 'Paranormal Activity 4' swings around for Halloween - and the only scare it will offer is how shockingly inept it is. Yes, you won't find much of a movie here, just an apparition of several much more superior classics that have come before it.",0
"The Apparition (2012) * (out of 4) The horror film Warner tried to sneak into theaters and hope no one noticed it. Sadly, I noticed it but thankfully it was only a $5 show (which was still a rip). Couple Kelly (Ashley Greene) and Ben (Sebastian Stan) arrive in a new home only to discover strange things happening. Kelly is all confused but apparently Ben recognizes this ""haunting"" due to an experiment he did in college where one of his best friends mysteriously vanished. While watching THE APPARITION my mind started to go back to the mid 90's before SCREAM came along and the horror genre was just delivering some pretty awful movies. This here reminded me of one of them because there's really nothing going right in this picture, which starts with an incredibly boring and unscary pre-credits sequence and sadly things just get worse from here. I'm sure in the writing stages people get an idea, look over it, make changes, take away the bad and add some good. They re-work the process until they come up with a story that they can work with. It really does seem that this film just took the first bad idea and filmed it so that they could get anything in a theater before Halloween. The entire story here is just simply bad, laughable and there were times where I just wanted to walk out on it. The entire situation is something I'll avoid spoiling for those who do decide to see the film but it all adds up to a half-baked idea that never works and the ending is just downright stupid. I'd say the studio should be thankful that no one is watching this or else it would probably be getting some heat. The performances aren't anything to write home about but I enjoyed Greene for the most part. THE APPARITION is obviously trying to follow in the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY foot steps but there's not a single scare to be had here.",0
"A rare horror movie I have ever watched in cinema. The premise and Ashley Greene are the ones that actually attracted me. I thought the tag line of 'You believe, you die' could have become something interesting but unfortunately, it is only touch and go. Ashley Greene is no doubt hot and her acting is not bad. Unfortunately, the movie is somewhat disappointing thanks to its so generic story and short runtime.The good: Ashley sizzles up the screen. The music is surprisingly okay for a horror movie. I like how it does not resort to shocking the audience with cheap jump scenes unlike other movies that are eager to make the audience jump often. Sadly, those are what I like about the movie.The bad: Lots of things for a horror movie. The story is nothing original which is a disappointment. It is very straight-forward with no twist. Just some ghostly events string up together. The runtime is one of the biggest crime. It is only 1 hour and 22 minutes and take away the credit's runtime and you get...nothing much. The story just zip to the ghostly events. Nothing much about the ghostly stuff is said. The climax, I must say, is one of the worst climax I have seen in a horror movie. It is almost anti-climax but I won't spoil anything. It just has no resolution. It is also not that scary nor intense. Acting is okay but fans of Tom Felton and Julianna Guill will be disappointed.Overall: It is barely worth a watch in cinema. I am sure it could be viewed as better when it is released on DVD/Blu-ray. The Apparition is a disappointingly generic low-budget horror movie which is a pity. The cast and the premise should have more potential to be interesting.",0
"The ads for ""The Apparition"" tell us it's about how believing in supernatural events can make them real. The finished film, on the other hand, never once says anything about belief or non-belief. There's only a lot of generic talk about summoning some dark, evil force from ""the other side."" Already, we have a huge problem, namely that people will pay to see a film founded on a premise conjured up by a studio marketing department rather than by the filmmakers. Did they know their movie was being so grossly misrepresented, that the prominent tagline, ""Once you believe, you die,"" does not factor into the storyline as they conceived it? This is the most infuriating display of bait-and-switch advertizing since ""Case 39,"" the long-delayed supernatural thriller about a demonic little girl in the care of Renée Zellweger.But suppose ""The Apparition"" hadn't relied on a deceptive ad campaign, that its actual premise had been used to entice audiences. What then? Not much, I'm afraid. Here is a horror movie so narratively tepid, so stylistically derivative, and so conceptually vague that one wonders if it began with anything resembling a screenplay. It has plenty in the way of atmosphere but virtually nothing in the way of plot, character development, theme, or insight. The thrills, while technically competent, are mediocre at best, all drawn from the likes of other, more original, and in most cases more successful horror films. This means that, nine times out of ten, we can see a scare coming long before it finally arrives. Unfortunately, this level of predictability doesn't extend to the overall story, which doesn't even try to be understandable.We open with Super 8 footage of a paranormal experiment conducted in the 1970s, when a group of people sitting around a table somehow summoned an entity from ""the other side."" This manifestation, known as The Charles Experiment, was successfully recreated decades later by a group of college students, who had an arsenal of high tech equipment at their disposal. We see their efforts courtesy of their own home video footage; rest assured, the Queasy Cam is utilized, and there's a lot of screaming in the darkness. Flash forward to what I assume is the present day. We meet a young couple, veterinarian-in-training Kelly (Ashley Greene) and tech-company service rep Ben (Sebastian Stan). They begin noticing strange things happening in their new house, such as doors open by themselves without tripping the burglar alarm, lights flickering, mysterious thuds, and large patches of mold growing spontaneously in odd places.And so continue these ""Paranormal Activity""-inspired events until Kelly discovers Ben's connection to the recreated college experiment, which resulted in the disappearance of one of the participants. It's obvious that some kind of supernatural entity is haunting Kelly and Ben. But what is it exactly? Here enters a British parapsychology student named Patrick (Tom Felton), a geeky typecast whose role is to provide the lead characters – and vicariously, the audience – with technobabble explanations of a wild, paranormal nature. The more he explains, the less sense the situation makes; this entity, whatever it is, operates under rules so random and confusing that no potential audience is likely to make heads or tails of it. We know that a doorway to the other side was opened, that it wants to exist in our world, that it lives off of our fears, that it wants to kill people, and that, at least in one instance, it can take the form of the missing participant. But why? What does any of this mean?Yet again, I turn my attention back to ""Paranormal Activity,"" which worked so well because nothing was explained. How is it possible that ""The Apparition"" fails for the exact same reason? The answer is simple: Unlike ""Paranormal Activity,"" which was much more psychologically driven, ""The Apparition"" is completely story driven, and therefore is required to be clear in its intentions. One cannot make a movie on merely an idea. It must first be honed into something comprehensible, something an audience can actually navigate through. Watching this movie is not at all unlike playing a game without knowing what the rules are; as you struggle to make sense of your surroundings, you're open to attacks from the opposing team.The final act, while visually engaging, is a maddening collection of twists and revelations that clarify absolutely nothing. The last scene in particular seems intentionally constructed to make as little sense as possible – and you should know that the trailer spoils it for you regardless. How could this have become such a mess? What movie did anyone involved believe they were making? It might have helped if the filmmakers had used the plot the ads falsely allude to. ""Paranormal events are a product of the human mind,"" says a small section on the homepage of the film's website, ""and ghosts only exist because we believe in them."" This is an intriguing idea, and it certainly would have been worth exploring. Apart from not being the film it was advertized to be, ""The Apparition"" is boring, unoriginal, and nonsensical.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",0
"If you are true horror fan you have most likely come to terms with the fact that a ""Great"" horror film is fairly rare nowadays. For the most part in the horror world all we get is remakes, reboots, and sequels. When we finally do get a stand alone movie it is easy to say that it will most likely just be an average movie (especially with ghost movies).I for one am far past expecting horror films to scare me, so I was not very disappointed when I realized ""The Apparition"" was not going to be scary. There isn't really much scary stuff out there that hasn't already been done in some other film, so it is incredibly hard to surprise audiences with good scares. Nothing in this movie is going to really catch you of guard or makes you shiver with fear, but you will most likely be entertained through out.The story is interesting enough, I never really found myself bored or wanting the film to end. It is also very short, which is actually a good thing in this case, since if it would have gone on for much longer I probably would have started to get fairly bored.I see people saying this film is terrible, boring, horrible, etc. I wouldn't really call it any of those things. Its very average, and as long as you go into this expecting that you will not be letdown. It won't be a film you will rush out and suggest to your friends, but it is still entertaining nonetheless and if you find yourself bored on a Friday night this will do a good job of occupying a little over an hour of your time.5/10",0
"This is a good simple ghost story that the teens can watch. The film starts out with a seance in 1973. It then abruptly switches to the present where a ""scientific seance experiment"" is going to be performed. The crew wires up their heads in order to intensify the energy field for the entity to pass through. Things don't go that well for Patrick (Tom Felton, Draco from ""Harry Potter"") and his crew as something has happened.The film jumps again to Ben (Sebastian Stan) who was part of the experiment and Kelly (Ashley Greene, Alice from ""Twilight"" ) one of the world's worse house sitters. Their house number is ""2812"" which flashes for a moment. It adds up to 13, although we really don't need a premonition of things to come. Like a good ghost story the odd events in the home build up slow until they reach a boiling point at which time my cat jumps on me.I enjoyed the build up. I also liked the way they integrated the ""found footage"" into the film and didn't rely strictly on it. Thank you Todd Lincoln. Ashley Kelly, who was allowed to act in ""Twilight"" gives us a good performance in this one in spite of Sebastian Stan being unconvincing in his part. As the lead actor in this film, his character was written rather shallow, which was the downfall of the film. I didn't like the repeated narration near the end of the film and the ending needed to be tweaked.Makes for a decent film for the sleepover, especially if they are sleeping outside in a tent.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Ashley Greene in bra, panties and a shoulder up shower scene. Minor swearing.",0
Wow what lame sauce. Horrible script! Good actors but hell awful script!,0
"In 1973, six paranormal psychologists tried to contact a recently deceased colleague named Charles Reamer and the event was known as The Charles Experiment. Decades later, the college student Patrick (Tom Felton) and his friends Lydia (Julianna Guill) and another one repeat the experiment while a fourth student films them. In the present days, Kelly (Ashley Greene), who works at a pet shop and her boyfriend Ben (Sebastian Stan), who works as an electronic technician, move together to the house of her mother that is empty. Soon they find that the house haunted by an evil force. When Ben checks his e-mails, he finds several messages from Patrick, including a video of a second experiment. Ben learns that Patrick has opened a gate and brought a gate and brought an evil spirit to our world. Now Kelly and Ben are in danger and their only chance it to meet Patrick and send the fiend back to his world.""The Apparition"" is a terrible rip-off of ""Paranormal Activity"", with a senseless and lame short story associated to poor direction and acting. The result is a movie that is a horror, instead of a horror movie. Fortunately this flick was only released in Brazil straight on DVD, and I feel sorry for those viewers that went to the movie-theaters to see this crap. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""A Aparição"" (""The Apparition"")",0
"If we pull this off we'll prove that ghosts, entities and the supernatural do exist. After 3 college friends get together to prove the existence of ghosts something strange happens. They decide that it didn't work and the three move on. Kelly (Greene) and Ben (Stan) are starting their life in their new home when the notice strange happenings. Nothing major but just things that make them think. When the events start to happen more and more they wonder what is going on. When an old friend tells Ben about an accident the couple realize they are in more danger then they thought. This is a hard movie to review. The first 15 minutes is pretty freaky. The next 45 minutes keeps you on the edge of your seat because you are waiting for something big to happen. The ending is OK but by the end it starts to run out of steam and was hard for me to keep interested all the way through. The movie was more psychological horror and not gory at all so that was kind of nice to see something different, but the movie ended up dragging too much for the end to have the impact I think it wanted. Overall, started off scary and was creepy throughout but drug a lot at the end. I give it a B-.",0
"Someone apparently decided that 'Paranormal Activity' + 'Pulse' + 'The Grudge' = good movie. Sadly in this case the math was way off.There are interesting ideas here but the execution is lacking. Credit where it's due; Sebastian Stan gives an impressively edgy performance and Tom Felton shows there's more to him than Draco Malfoy (it's a shame he isn't given more to do). Ashley Greene... looks pretty in her underwear. In all honesty she wasn't given much to do here - despite ostensibly being the lead. The cinematography is good - and that's about it.What should be a straight-forward plot is jumbled by unnecessary elements and images that seem to be included simply because someone thought they'd 'look cool'. It's not enough to take inspiration from great and/or successful horror movies, you need to understand why they were so great and/or successful - and first-time director (and writer) Todd Lincoln apparently doesn't. The opening five minutes hold promise, but it's downhill from there. I like atmospheric chillers, but this is short on atmosphere and the chills are non-existent. 5/10",0
"I was waiting for this movie to come out for a while now. The reason being that I'd heard a lot about it on some horror sites. So I finally got it the other day on DVD and although it wasn't great, it wasn't a total waste of time. The story is about a couple (Ben and Kelly) who move in to a newish house on a new estate. But soon after that they discover that they're being haunted by some sort of entity that Ben had released in to the world a year or so earlier with a group of friends. Now I know the story is nothing new but I did like the effects in this movie. There were some good WTF moments and a couple of scary-ish scenes but to me it felt like there was something missing, that it needed a couple of more scenes to tie it all together as I felt left wanting more from the plot, and the film was only 73 minutes long. It could have gone another 10 minutes I thought. So yes I did like the movie but it could have been much better. I give it a 7 out of 10.",0
"THE APPARITION is yet another CGI ghost film from the good ol' US of A. Apparently, producers haven't cottoned on yet that the general viewing public are sick and tired of these clichéd, poorly written products, so they keep on churning them out. This one's the work of Dark Castle Entertainment, who first came to light with the remakes of HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL and THIRTEEN GHOSTS at the turn of the century, but whose horror fare has steadily deteriorated ever since.The plotting of THE APPARITION is entirely boring for the most part. It involves an unlikable and self-centred couple who discover their home is haunted by the traditional CGI spook. Cue lots of CGI-augmented scare scenes and not much sense. Ashley Greene and Sebastian Stan make for the most boring, vapid leading characters I've seen for a while in a film, and I was hoping they'd be bumped off by the vengeful spook early on in the proceedings. No such luck.Where THE APPARITION has promise is in its filmed back story, taking place during the 1970s, where a team of university researchers manage to conjure up the spook. Tom Felton (13HRS) is on hand and as a whole this is very interesting stuff, based on documented records. If the whole film had been set in the 1970s and stayed with these characters (a la THE CONJURING) then it might have been more interesting, instead of the usual generic mess.",0
"The Apparition was actually a nice change of pace for an otherwise stale genre of ghost movies that most recently have been flooded by a heap of super fake 'found footage' movies that we are spoon-fed to believe is actually real. But then ""The Apparition"" comes along and manages to lift up the genre from an otherwise downward spiral.The story in ""The Apparition"" is not overly scary, as per se, but it does move ahead at a brisk pace, and it does leave you wondering what is going on and wanting to see more. Unfortunately, there weren't any scare moments in the movie, and that was a shame, because a couple of scares and 'edge-of-the-seat' moments would have been nice.However, the movie does provide you with just the right amount of suspense, thrills and ghostly phenomena to keep it interesting. And it turning out to be a poltergeist phenomena just makes it all the more interesting.As for the acting in the movie, well then people did good enough jobs with their given characters and roles, although no one really managed to stand out from the crowd. That being said, don't get me wrong, because they weren't amateurs.I enjoyed ""The Apparition"" for what it was, a good-hearted attempt at returning to the good old atmosphere that they had in ""Poltergeist"". However, ""The Apparition"" was just lacking all the ghosts, spooks and disturbing images. Sure, ""The Apparition"" is not ""Poltergeist"", nor is it ""Thirteen Ghosts"", but it still does provide good entertainment.",0
"It's a decent angle at a haunting, but the writing is just not good.It has a good cast. It has good looking shots and special FX. The trailer drew me in. They did good with that. There are some really clever things in the movie, like how the furniture was rearranged in the room, literally. That was cool. But the story is just poorly written.It isn't the worst movie out there, as some others have said. That's silly. I have seen much worse! But I give it a generous 5 stars for production value. The movie is not worth watching other than for educational purposes, in my humble opinion. Sorry guys. But a different script with the same production team could have much better results.",0
"Once again something is unlocked.Will you people never learn lol.The Apparition is a moderate film at best, starts off better than it ends.The acting is pretty good, but as the movie unfolds (or unravels) it loses your interest somewhat.Still it provides a bit of fun and distraction.",0
"This movie is bad. There is one scene where my brother and I literally face palmed simultaneously. Please do not go see this. Please do not wait for blockbuster. Please do not wait for red box. Please do not wait for netflix. Don't even pirate this. It's that bad. The only good reason to go and see this is if you want something to complain about later. In fact, I had more fun complaining about how bad this movie is than actually watching it. And I like this genre. I'm stoked for Paranormal 4, Resident Evil 5, and Silent Hill 2. If your looking for decent alternatives, check out The Innkeepers, Grave Encounters (cheesy, but cool), or the Tunnel. That one scared the hell out of me. The Tunnel is available to torrent legally too.",0
"I first heard about this movie by listening to Coast to Coast AM where the Writer/Director was on talking about this film and how he was inspired by actual events. So I was really anticipating watching this film.At first it started out pretty interesting but then it took a turn for the worse. I started to not care about what was going on, the characters were a bit annoying and I didn't really care about them one way or another.The film is not scary, it has its thrilling moments but all in all it's just a typical horror film for the new generation which really means its pathetic.I think the film would have been awesome if it had followed the group doing the experiment on getting a ghost to appear, in fact that's what I was thinking I was getting into but instead got a cheap shot at a horror film that left me feeling like I had completely wasted my time.It had some good moments but all in all it's not really worth watching.",0
"The Apparition is an abomination of the horror genre. It tried so hard, but fell smack flat with lacklustre delivery, with a non existent plot and absolutely zero scares. Worst, the studios seem to know of the problems with the film, and put just about every fine moment that the film has onto its trailer, committing the cardinal sin of telling the entire story, and showing the exact ending. All these just to ramp up interest in its premise, before the sham got exposed a few minutes into its short runtime of 82 minutes.Written and directed by first timer Todd Lincoln, it felt as if the filmmaker was totally clueless in knowing how to tell a story, rooting from a single great idea of a premise for the genre, but having undoubtedly little inspiration and creativity in the development of a story from the idea. It teased with the introductory inter-title about an experiment from the 70s, before proceeding to show a film purportedly capturing some glimpses of the said experiment. Fast forward to today, some college students get involved in trying to replicate that 70s experiment, involving the invocation of a spirit, and all goes awry.Before you know it, that narrative thread is left hanging in the hopes that it will create suspense and mystery, and the film went on for the most parts to tell the story of lovebirds Ben (Sebastian Stan) and Kelly (Ashley Greene), in showing just how awesome their lives are, and having to co-habitate in the holiday home of Kelly's parents, in a designer neighbourhood with all but one neighbour. Perfect set up for things that go bump in the night, and before long, we follow the duo trying to make sense of shadows, open doors, moving furniture and the likes, before finally freaking out and looking for answers in the form of Ben's friend Patrick (Tom Felton), who was his buddy in that same college experiment seen earlier in the film.As mentioned, there is absolutely nothing here that will raise your adrenaline level, or make you cower from behind semi-closed eyes. A toddler will probably laugh at the meek attempts to create an atmosphere to scare, and perhaps find Ashley Greene prancing around in her underwear a lot more appealing for those peek-a-boo moments. Pacing is totally off, not helped by Todd Lincoln having no story to tell. Everyone seemed to be sleepwalking in their roles, making it horrendous to sit through with scenes being fairly stand-alone with little links to one another, and the premise right at the beginning, well, was just that, not being exploited fully to keep everything under one coherent narrative.You can sense that Lincoln had probably wanted to tell of a more cerebral story than the usual run of the mill horror flicks, but surely this is way out of his league, and I'm sure many in the audience will appreciate a more direct approach in dishing out the scares. He's got to realize that he's no Kiyoshi Kurosawa as the story tries so hard to become a spiritual peer to the Japanese director's acclaimed film Kairo (which was remade by Hollywood into Pulse), and that one shouldn't bite off more than one can chew.The Apparition makes watching paint dry seem like a roller coaster ride. Avoid it at all costs, unless you want to learn how not to make a film. You have been warned as this stinker sinks right to the bottom of the pile of worst films of the year.",0
"Last night was one of those ""free promo code at Redbox"" nights & so I went to peruse & rent some movie I have never heard of or that I wouldn't be able to watch with anyone else. I love creepy movies but not necessarily ""horror"" movies. I am disappointed in the scary movie genre 98% of the time. The Apparition's opening scenes had me rolling my eyes as usual. The ""raw footage"" was so obviously not raw - top grade film made to look old & grungy and camera angles that would never be taken on a home camcorder. I hate the whole idea that they are applying science to ghosts...like machines & computers could really measure the supernatural and I hate that there's the one guy, Patrick, that knows so much about all of it (How does he know all this stuff?). Then in the introduction of the characters, the music and filming style become so upbeat, slick & polished, the characters so good looking that it feels like a car commercial or something. It's not until the freaky things start happening in the couple's house that the movie becomes unexpectedly good. Even the score becomes original, twisted and melded with the strange things that are happening. The writers get an A+ for coming up with new ways freak you out. I'm so tired of every movie copying all others in timing, the ""boo factor"", score, etc. The use of this strange mold appearing in the house, the variety (& not overuse) of the subtle mysterious happenings (all the doors suddenly being wide open), the weird weird way that *something* knotted Kelly's clothes up and impossibly twisted all of her hangers... I love that there is no real ""bad guy"", no person in a rubber mask playing some stupid monster, but it's this subtle strange, faceless, darkness that is happening. The setting, unusual for a horror movie, is in a modern clean suburban neighborhood. This, on the one hand, loses all the creepiness of an old dilapidated house or terror of a fall wood, but brings the story right into your own plush home. When the couple goes to a hotel and they are followed by the haunting it serves to widen the horror to their whole world. Also what happens in the hotel room was so terrifying to me that tears were coming out of my eyes because of a real life situation I was in (as well as some true stories from friends). The movie is not without its silly Hollywood gimmicks or plot problems,(also having a main character that is so hot that I can't help staring at *her* instead of what's happening, damn you writers/casting people) but this is a good freaky movie if you're in the mood for the adrenaline that comes from being terrified.",0
"Went in with no expectations att all regarding this. And i must say i was positively amazed. The story centers on a couple moving into a new house. Soon weird things start to happen, things which can only be described as a haunting. Seems like the boyfreind was part of an experiment that went awry. They tried to contact an entity from the other side and succeeded with catastrophic consequences. One of the team was sucked in to the other side. Anyways, now the apparition is out to get the rest of the team, which unfortenatly includes the girlfriend. (I mean what the heck? Why say no to an extra snack) As far as the movie goes its pretty standard haunted house business. But its pretty well done. Jumpscares galore, sure but it does it pretty well. The acting is OK to, fun to see Tom felton again. The effects are sparse but executed well, including spooky shadows and otherwordly noises. SPOILERS! The end reminded me of Kairo, other spirits uses the rift the team created and seem to bring on the end of days! So, I know this movie has taken a lot of crap, but really, how whiny can you get! Its a fun horror flick, no more no less, and i sure recommends it to fans of haunted house movies.",0
"The film starts with supposedly true footage of contact with the paranormal and than moves on to a set piece involving a group of people trying to contact the same entity and the results are disastrous of course. Some years later a generic couple find their themselves and their new house being haunted. At first with noises, and than things moving, lights flickering and than a strange mold finally becoming more aggressive. The setup sounds pretty generic and I'd be lying if I didn't say that it's a muddled piece of genre work at best. The continuity is all over the place to the point of confusion. I wasn't even sure either member of the lead couple were even involved in the experiment for most of the films running time. And speaking of running time it clocks in about 75 mins. without the credits. This normally would lead to believe that things move quickly but it's quite the opposite the film feels a lot longer than it actually is. It plods along systematically with scenes involving a surprising amount of lead up that goes nowhere sadly. The film does manage a few creepy moments and the performances are all fine for the most part but sadly they are limited to a bad script and even less competent direction. Even the visuals seem a bit forced and the most annoying thing about all of this. Is the writers blatant intent to write characters that don't feel the least bit real committing such mind baffling acts as staying in a tent in the backyard after being attacked in the house , running into the woods, staying in this damn house instead of going outside on so many occasions and crawling into a tent during the films somewhat interesting climax amongst others. Also there is a fare amount of ridiculous closeups on Ashley Greene in the shower and one in which she walks around the house lingerie oiled up for no discernible reason. And to add insult to injury lets through in a scene of a dog basically dying of natural causes and falling lightly over to his death on the laundry room floor, que the unintentional laughter. The sad thing is there are some talented people here Ashley Greenes performance is limited due to the script but it's solid, Sebastian Stan has some decent moments as well as Harry Potter's Tom Felton there are some inspired moments in the films creative direction leading me to believe that maybe he should assist someone before moving onto his next project. And most of all there is an idea here buried under all the clichéd muck that's really kinda cool. And one that a genre film hasn't approached before about releasing an inhuman entity via purgatory and having it breach and infect our reality. Sadly the end execution is a huge failure and we are just left with tidbits of potential surrounded by a sordid cinematic inability to connect the dots. **/5",0
"I just watched this movie on DVD. Admittedly, I was about to turn it off before the film actually began due to the sheer volume of disk spam. That is, there were so many previews that my patience had grown quite thin even fast forwarding through them. Then there was the plug for Ultra Violet, the studio plugging themselves, and so on. THEN, after the anti-pirating warning which, of course, doesn't allow fast forwarding. Ah, movie time..My expectations were already quite low, although this was based on the previews shown in the half hour (or so it seemed) before getting to the feature. They were all so bad that one was left with little hope for the main attraction. My low expectations were spot on.I could go on at length about what is bad in this movie, but it would be too hard to resist simply saying ""everything"". Instead, I will touch on the good points. (1) The lighting was, overall, pretty good and (2) the image was quite clear and sharp; Good camera work. I gave it one star for each, thus 2 out of 10.Nothing in the film seemed believable. From beginning to end, this movie is a waste. The worst part? That time is lost forever, and it could have been better spent doing something more entertaining - like cutting my toenails.",0

"The Apparition (2012) starts off with a good premise, a couple working on a college experiment experience an unexpected consequence. This movie moves at a fast pace and will make you leery of what to expect next. A good old fashion scary movie that fizzles out. A bit silly but another spooky film. The suspense comes and goes but overall makes for a fun thriller that playing with matches you might get burnt. I now know what not to experiment with. I enjoyed the movie and will be a good addition to this genre of the movie world. The couple plays a good portrayal being on the run and the typical scary noises and fast pace film sequences keep it suspenseful.",0

"As of today it seems like the kulturkampf between Recep Ivedik lovers and Recep Ivedik haters is going on meaninglessly. Out of 404 people who have voted for Recep Ivedik so far 138 people rated it '1' while 118 people rated it '10'. What makes IMDb different from the local cineast sites is that its voting system is more serious and reliable but for Recep Ivedik 3 people seem to have been torn at the two extreme ends. In a TV program named 'cinemania' the creator of the Recep Ivedik character Şahan Gökbakar said: ""I have been telling this for two years and I am really tired of repeating it.If people can see movies like Schindler's List in a cinematic way while they are not looking for 'art' in movies like Pink Panther then you can't just look for pure art in Ivedik either."" Gökbakar clearly states that Recep Ivedik is a commercial blockbuster. It is a simple mainstream movie of which only aim is to make people laugh.If people do look for more than that in Ivedik it doesn't make sense for them to keep watching the sequels. Based on the character Recep Ivedik from the Turkish television series ""Dikkat sahan cikabilir"" (2005-2006) Recep Ivedik 1 had a worldwide gross of $24,878,340. More than five million people went to the theaters to see the first movie and this is a national record which has not been broken again. With its unconnected story,the sequel Recep Ivedik 2 turned out to be a big disappointment for the loyal fans.Still it had the commercial success and now we have Recep Ivedik 3. Recep Ivedik 3 is the first movie among the series which has a decent plot.Our hero,the kind-hearted bear is fighting against depression this time.The biggest help will come from Zeynep, the daughter of Recep's friend from his local village.Zeynep the freshwoman,who gets kicked out of her dormitory is bound to stay with Ivedik since she has nowhere else to go. Studying sociology-psychology as her double major,she thinks that the only way for Recep to get over depression is to socialize.To help him socialize Zeynep tries to do different things together with him like taking part in a music course where Ivedik plays a fipple flute with his nose,a paint-ball war, a karate activity and finally going to see a drama. Ivedik makes pointed,memorable references to well-known things in Turkey.For instance, when he goes to get a movie from the local bootleg CD vendor, the guy suggests he should see ""Monkey 3"". Ivedik's witty repartee is :""I have seen the previous Ceylan movie.I put the CD on the player. A guy was walking.I went to run a few errands,paid my bills. When I came back the man was still walking"" Even this repliqe is a clear reminder to the viewers that Ivedik is not an art house movie with scanty dialog in which you will need to focus on the mere footsteps of a guy. At another moment,Ivedik speaks in English. To motivate his paint-ball team buddies,he uses the same sentences Faith Terim ,the former Turkish national team coach used after the game against Greece a couple of years ago.Terim had butchered English with his poor,comical language abilities. He had used the Turkish equivalent ""tabela"" ( from Italian tabella)when he could not remember the simple word ""scoreboard"" Ivedik also makes fun of the TV series Ask-i memnu"" (2008)by giving one of the names of the leading characters,Behlül to the sympathetic goat. You can clearly notice Şahan performs a one-man show. He is the only reason you will see this movie and the character he created is the only reason you will laugh.With its reasonable plot and more organized cinematography Recep Ivedik 3 could have been the best movie of the series but I must admit that I have not laughed as much as I laughed in the first movie. Still, I think it's far better than the second movie. No matter what kind of a movie Şahan makes, there will be people who call it 'pure garbage'. If you really know what you are looking for in an Ivedik movie I don't think you will find it so bad.After all, if you just hated the first and the second movie why on earth should you go to the third one? Never mind the defamatory troll posts on the net. Recep Ivedik is neither the perfect comedy movie which deserves ten out ten nor it's the worst comedy movie which deserves one out ten. I can accept that some people may think Recep Ivedik is only a movie which begs to be downloaded on the net but all I can say is that if you just want to laugh and if you do not look for anything else, go for it!",0
"This movie is really entertaining. i am a huge fan of sahans work. he is a legend. i can understand that the movie does not attract everyone, i think you kind of need to be familiar with turkish culture in order to get the message sometimes.One thing i love about sahan is, that he creates comedy scenes which are funny but always have a reflection of a typical tuskish way of thinking. If you watch it you always feel connected and familiar with it. There are sometimes even hidden critism about something in turkish culture and I really like that.",0
"Popular Turkish comedy writer and performer Şahan Gökbakar (""Dıkkat Şahan Çıkabılır"") reunites with his younger brother Togan Gökbakar (""Gen"") for the third film in their Turkish box office blockbuster comedy series ""Recep İvedik"" featuring a somewhat toned down version of his titular comedy character than in previous outings.Fat, aggressive, unibrowed slob Recep İvedik (Şahan Gökbakar) has plunged into inconsolable grief following the death of his beloved grandmother at the end of the last film when in walks spunky college girl and distant relative Zeynep (Zeynep Çamci) to guide him through the required skits of his emotional journey to recovery.Şahan Gökbakar returns with a slightly more controlled and less foul-mouthed incarnation of the inspired burlesque exaggeration of the so-called 'maganda' at large in the city while superb support comes from the cute but occasionally grating Zeynep Çamci, who had a minor role in the previous film, as the naive young kid who can tame this wild bear.The film-makers have tried to create more of an emotional underpinning for the comedy creation's character arch this time out but it still just boils down to a series of short burlesque comedy routines tied together by the loosest of story-lines that will only appeal to those with an intimate understanding of the society they are attempting to skew.""This is just a shell, inside it's still the old Recep""",0
"I think my understanding of comedy has changed as time has passed. Farting didn't seem funny to me anymore, when I first watched it I was a kid, a teenager and the first movie was funny to me. I watched other movies too -_- What did I do?? The Movie is very, very bad.",0
"Compared to her early films, it was a film that exaggerated the drama. As such, absurd humor could not show itself. It's a movie that doesn't suit such a typing. Another issue is that the film always proceeds in the same way, even the contrasts applied to the film are the same. Also, I think it would be more appropriate to accompany such a film with more vivid colors. It is not right for Recep Ivedik to have an emotional approach to people who are not of her own blood, who are not like her, because she is not like everyone else. All I want is for this series to progress in the ""bros before hoes"" mind.",0
"Fifty Shades of Grey is based on a badly written book, so why someone thought they could make a decent film out of it is beyond me. Actually I don't think anyone believed they could make a good film, the producers just wanted the money that would come in from all people who for reasons known only to themselves read the book.I had a free ticket and I had to go in order to do a story on it. Bottom line, I'm not doing a story on it.Okay, here's the problem, and this is what breaks my heart. We no longer know what good or great is. I am no follower of Ayn Rand, but in The Fountainhead, she predicted the rise of mediocrity, mediocrity being considered great and the norm we shoot for. It only stands to reason that at this point, some things can't even rise to that sad level. This isn't mediocre, it's pathetic. I can't believe there are people complimenting the actors. But then I can, because they have come to accept mediocrity. Something I fight against with all my heart.There is one other problem. The book sucked; in order to like it, one had to use his or her imagination. The success of this book lay in the fantasy aspect. Sometimes imagination is more powerful than just about anything and can give you an erotic experience. This film doesn't fulfill the most inane imagination, let alone someone who really has a wild and creative one. The only fantasy it can give you is how fast you can get out of the theater.There were people around me laughing. The ones who weren't left, and from what I found out in the lobby, actually demanded and got their money back. When was the last time you saw people leaving a movie in the middle? I'm not sure I've ever seen it, and I'll guess I've been going to movies longer than a lot of you.I lament the loss of artistic soul, of creativity, of going for the best. I miss the days when Billy Wilder was a writer and a filmmaker. What are we left with but a horrible book written on a first grade level and the resulting bad movie.",0
"I don't want to spoil a lot, so ill just give ratings with a brief description on certain elements of this so-called ""film"".Acting; 3/10. The acting was misplaced, awkward.. not to look at. At least convince us you're an intense guy, Mr. Grey. Plot: 1/10. that wasn't a plot for a normal movie, it was a plot for soft-core porn.. which had as terrible acting in it as real porn. Camera work/scenery/etc. 7/10 for what it is.. great camera work i guess and good sceneryRomance; 2/10. I've seen the notebook... that's romance. This is a poor attempt to romance. It tries to tell you they're madly in love, but it's just a weird sexual relationship.Drama: 1/10. there is no thrill.. no intense things going on. There is no drama in this soft-core-erotic-drama. ""The deeds"" 10/10.. they did it. so.. can't give it any lower points than this. Overall, it's was horrible acted, plot-less, non-romantic nor drama movie about a girl being horny and the guy doing an attempt of BDSM, which comes down to.. soft-core.. almost nothing different than normal sex with bondage.. boring sh*t. on that note, go watch the kings man; secret service. that's one of the best action movies i've seen in a while!",0
"Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) ** (out of 4) Rather silly adaptation of the E.L. James best-seller about a shy, timid virgin (Dakota Johnson) who meets the elusive billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Doman) and soon both of their lives change.Writing a plot synopsis of this thing is pretty pointless since I'm sure the target audience is already going to know the story. I guess this is where I should admit that I haven't read the book so this review won't be comparing the two or complaining about what the movie did or didn't do from the book. No, this review is just going to be based around the actual movie and for the life of me I can't see what all the hype is about. I don't expect everyone laying their money down to be some sort of film buff but the ""shocking"" material on display here has been going on in European movies for four-plus decades so why it's just now reaching American shores is pretty funny in itself but that's off subject I guess.As for the film, there are all sorts of major issues with it but we can start with the laughable screenplay, which would have been rejected by the Lifetime channel and in fact, I'm going to guess that it would have been rejected has a five-year-old written it. The dialogue is without question some of the most laughable I've heard in a very long time. In fact, the movie seems to be lost in what decade it is because there are times that the ""F"" word is used and it's used in a way to where it's supposed to be shocking. Really? It's going to take more than that. The entire character development between the two lead characters is another joke and after a while you really can't buy into any of the melodrama and you've just got to sit back and laugh.The performances are another problem but then again, even the likes of Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor couldn't work with horrid material so I'm not going to be too harsh on Johnson and Doman. With that said, the lackluster direction by Sam Taylor-Johnson doesn't help either as there are many times where another take should have happened. The scenes with Johnson playing the shy girl just aren't very believable because the actress can't sell it. The scenes of her explaining she's a virgin are laughably bad. Doman really doesn't get much to work with and especially since he can't crack a smile and has to give off dumb, overly-serious facial expressions throughout. I will say that the actors have a nice chemistry together but that's about it. The supporting players are all equally forgettable.Yet another problem is that the film just isn't erotic. FATAL ATTRACTION, BASIC INSTINCT and even something as silly as BODY OF EVIDENCE are just a few recent films that packed a lot more punch than this one. I mean, is sticking an eraser around your lips really erotic anymore? A lot of the lack of erotic-ness has to be blamed on the director who just seems to have been the wrong fit for the material. Nothing from the erotic nature to the serious stuff works and everything is poorly edited.So, why the two-stars for all the negative stuff? As bad as the film is, thankfully it reaches the level to where you can't help but laugh and be mildly entertained as to what's going to happen next. Again, I haven't read the book so I don't know which one is better but the film is pretty flat from start to finish.",0
"I never had any intention of watching ""Fifty Shades of Grey""...none. However, when IMDB recently revamped their Bottom 100 List and I saw the movie was now on the list, I felt I had to see it. After all, I constantly am checking out the list to see what new additions there are so I can watch them. I do occasionally like seeing a bad movie...they can be very entertaining and unintentionally funny. Now ""Fifty Shades"" is very different from any other film on the list (with the exception of ""The Last Airbender"") in that it WAS a mega-hit and lots of people liked it...though at the same time its score of 4.1 on IMDB is anemic....making it a love-hate sort of picture.Anastasia Steele (great name, huh?) is a dim sort of lady....and I'm sorry but there's no better way to describe her accurately. When she goes to interview a big-shot businessman, Christian Grey, she has no idea what she's doing, hasn't prepared in the least and asks him only banal questions. She seemed rather dull and with little personality and it was difficult to see what he saw in her. Yet, despite this, inexplicably Grey is now obsessed with her. In some ways, he seems like a nice guy--such as coming to her aid when she's drunk in a dance club soon after this meeting. But in many, he gives so many signs that he's not normal in the least...and rather creepy and possibly very dangerous. He's incredibly controlling and in response to her getting drunk he says ""If you were mine, you wouldn't be able to sit down for a week"". In other words, for getting drunk and behaving stupidly, he'd paddle the crap out of her! He then has her sign a non-disclosure agreement--saying she'll never tell anyone about him!! Soon, they are embarking on a weird S&M relationship...and that's when the film shows a lot of nekkidness, though it's of the soft-core variety. But he is clear...this is NOT love and he doesn't want to be close to anyone...and he doesn't even want to actually sleep with her...just have his way with her.What I find so bizarre about the whole ""Fifty Shades"" phenomenon is that in the 21st century, the actions of BOTH Anastasia and Christian are the exact opposite of what society is telling us folks should be like or what romance should be. There really ISN'T any romance...and he doesn't want to date her. It's not so much just the S&M aspects that I found bothersome...it's more that you have a man who dominates a woman and controls her and she is passive and does whatever he says. Her needs are also not particularly important and he wants to control every aspect of her life and breaks into her apartment when she isn't home. This is NOT the feminist idea of today...at least not what folks SAY they want in a relationship. I simply do not understand this dichotomy...nor why folks loved the books and films...yet also claim to hate them! I also worry that a film like this could set the stage for date rapes, as here in the film it's supposed to be romantic...but in real life, it could get you imprisoned. Weird.So although I found the message strange and possibly dangerous and the writing occasionally silly, what about the techincal aspects of the movie? The movie is very polished--with lovely and very appropriate music, excellent cinematography and is very artistic. For this reason alone, although I didn't like or respect the message, the film deserves more than a few stars on IMDB. I should add that although the film features a lot of nudity, I really didn't find it all that exciting to watch...mostly because the film was just creepy. It also didn't come off as sexy....just creepy. And, it probably would NOT be a great date night film...as your date might think you are...just creepy. Watch it if you'd like...I just didn't particular enjoy it nor understand WHY it made so much money...I just found it, believe it or not, to be rather dull.",0
"Sorry but I can't get over Jamie Doran.. I mean he comes from playing a serial killer in the Fall (who tied up women and murdered them) to .. Well. 20 mins of sex. The movie is boring and predictable. The fine line between abuse and pleasure is so thin it's almost non- existent. Lacks any of the raunch or controversy promised, and is instead tiresome, banal and as thinly plotted as a porn. I haven't read the book.. and I have to say I didn't finish the movie. I don't think i missed much by leaving 20 mins early, but it was just boring. If a man had written the book he would probably have been jailed. Its beyond understanding what people see in the book/movie. Unless all the women I know are telling me lies and secretly want to be tied up and abused by a perverted man.",0
"When the end credits began to roll, I was given a fleeting look by the people sitting next to me in the cinema. They were probably checking to see if I was still alive; such was my horror and, quite frankly, disbelief, I had not moved from the same position for at least an hour. A wide-opened mouth, bulging eyes and clenched fists on the armrests at my sides. No, I was not enamoured with the movie. No, I did not find the scenes of bondage shocking. I had simply lost the will to live. One might remember a famous novel by a famous author, '1984'. Until I walked out of that movie house, I didn't know what had spurned Orwell's mind in the creation of his dystopian society, but now I have a vague idea. Orwell wasn't afraid of being stalked by the government - he was terrified that future society would become the way it is today. I'm not referring to high-octane sexual fantasies, because we all have our own desires and it's not my place to judge. No, what Orwell envisaged, surely, is acting so terrible, movies so poorly made and producers so incompetent, that the likes of Hitchcock and Bogart are probably turning in their graves. With laughter. Fifty Shades of Grey is a mediocre work by a laughable author of FanFiction, meaning that without the abysmal Twilight series, the TRULY abysmal movie that I have suffered through today could not have existed. Someone get me a DeLorean and a Flux Capacitor; it's time to right a few wrongs.There is only one sure-fire way to improve this catastrophe and that is, quite literally, with fire. Burn it. Burn it all to ash and spread the cinders across the resting ground of Cthulhu. Without this worthy sacrifice, surely the monster will rise up to wreak havoc upon us deserving mortals. All in all, I have only one recommendation for the people who will, inevitably, be dragged (ironic term, given the movie) to the cinema/theatre to watch this complete abomination: therapy. Years and years of therapy. But avoid the groups. Once you see Mr. Grey's 'desires' for yourself, you'll probably be afraid to stand in the same room as another human being for, oh, several hundred millennia.And there's worse to come: rumours talk of a trilogy, to keep things up to speed with the 'books'. What's that sound? Oh, it's just the splatter of the blood I'm currently weeping. I'm sure that's unrelated...Right? Guys? Oh...",0
"Okay. So I have not read the book, (being a male), and I went with one of my female friends who HAD read the book, (and she said she had enjoyed it) -- although having said that, she had read it a number of years ago. We paid our money and we took our seats. The film began; and I have to say that the wooden acting, the cruddy screenplay, the corny dialogue, the ridiculous script, the highly improbable storyline, were all just TOO much for us! (And not just us it seems! As we could hear titters from the audience at large as well coming from dialogue within the story that were supposed to be serious scenes -- so not just us I hasten to add)...We gave it half an hour and then I leaned over to my friend and said ""Do you think there's any chance they will give us our money back?? What do you think to it?"" -- and thank God she replied, ""Oh thank Heavens you said that; I can't stand it another minute! Lets just get outta here!!!!!!! It's just terrible"".We got our money back. We complained it was nothing like the book and that we demanded a refund as had only seen half an hour of the movie, and hey presto they refunded my credit card! No questions asked! I give this rubbish 1 star; and that was for the pretty outdoor scenery! Don't waste your time with it -- it is Hollywood at it's worst.",0
"Hopefully, as a heterosexual female student in her twenties with a love of film that spreads across all genres and decades, this will come over as a fair assessment of a film that genuinely did nothing for me.Have not read the books, though have heard conflicting opinions that has mostly been intense dislike. The reason for watching 'Fifty Shades of Grey' was not due to wanting to hate on it, being a negative person, curiosity but for the reason of being at a film night with friends recently and 'Fifty Shades of Grey' happened to be the film choice. Just for the record, the general consensus ranged from indifference to hating it with a passion.There are two minor pros. The best thing about 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is most of the beguiling soundtrack, that has a soothing nostalgia and appropriately amorous quality, this is all for the song choices though. 'Fifty Shades of Grey' also looks good, nice use of scenery and very nicely shot.On the other hand, Danny Elfman's score is one-note and repetitive, as well as too derivative of his recent work. He has composed some wonderful stuff ('Edward Scissorhands' is magical) but this is really not his best work. The direction has slickness but overall is too mannered which really affects the film's tone and pacing.Regarding the acting, none of the supporting cast are of note, including Marcia Gay Harden, but a larger issue is the two leads and their complete lack of chemistry. Understated can be a lovely quality to acting, as long as it also becomes nuanced and with believability given to the dialogue. Dakota Johnson, especially in the first third, is too understated that it feels more like there is a lack of personality or emotion. Jamie Dornan looks uncomfortable throughout, delivers his cringe-worthy lines awkwardly and is just bland as dishwater with no charisma whatsoever. Chemistry is non-existent.'Fifty Shades of Grey's' dialogue does them absolutely no favours, dialogue so bad that absolutely nobody (even the best actors and actresses) can do anything with it. It causes unintentional laughter throughout, is embarrassingly clunky and is pure smut. Then there is the story that is so thin structurally, heavy in repetition, so badly plodding and without style or atmosphere that the film feels twice as long, with the sexual elements done far too tamely and the BDSM portrayal deceitful. None of the characters are engaging or interesting, practically ciphers.All in all, a very poor film with two minor pros and the rest of the film massively flawed. 2/10 Bethany Cox",0
"You simply can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. The book was unquestionably the worst piece of writing I'd ever encountered, so what the hell were they thinking in making this rubbish? Apart from the tedium of the plod (read plot), the script is cobbled together with hollow dialogue, countless use of retch-inducing signifiers and cliché, a complete lack of chemistry between the characters and predictable scenarios and outcomes at every turn. I got the feeling throughout the film that both these actors were desperate to get off the set, go home (but certainly to separate houses), drown their shared humiliation with a stiff drink or ten, and set fire to their contracts. Woeful book. Woeful film. Don't waste your money on this drivel. There are Fifty Reasons to STAY AWAY.",0
"Despite its unsavory sadomasochistic subject matter, this cinematic adaptation of author E.L. James' erotic bestseller ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" qualifies as puritanical. I can say this because I managed to get through ten chapters of the book before I saw the Universal Pictures release. ""Nowhere Boy"" director Sam Taylor-Johnston and ""Saving Mr. Banks"" scenarist Kelly Marcel have sanitized James' novel and turned it into an antiseptic, ""Cinderella"" fairy tale about an affluent Prince Charming and a book-wormy English Lit major. Not that it matters, director Sam Taylor-Johnston is a woman rather than a man. Johnston and Marcel have forged a film that features simulated sex scenes without steam and cardboard characters without souls. Mind you, ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" isn't as abysmal as the amateurish ""Addicted."" Johnston stages several sex scenes where actress Dakota Johnson bares only her breasts, while actor Jamie Dornan displays little more than his carefully sculpted abs and buttocks. Ladies hoping for a glimpse of male genitalia are going to be sorely frustrated because ""Fifty Shades"" is R-rated rather than NC-17, like both ""Shame"" (2011) and ""The Lover"" (1992) where full frontal nudity was conspicuous. Comparatively speaking, little if anything risqué occurs until the concluding scene. You won't see anything like the candle dripping sex in the Madonna movie ""Body of Evidence"" (1993); the kitchen sink sex between Michael Douglas and Glenn Close in ""Fatal Attraction,"" or the infamous ""Last Tango in Paris"" where Marlon Brando improvised on Maria Schneider with a blob of butter. Subsequent adaptations of James' two novels may pass up on the prudish approach after Universal studio executives have analyzed audience tolerance. Altogether, this soft-porn entry in the trilogy shouldn't hoist anybody's eyebrows.Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnston of ""The Five Year Engagement"") is a shy, virginal, doe-eyed brunette who majors in English Lit at Washington State University and works at a hardware store. She shares an apartment with her best friend, blond-haired Kate Kavanagh (Eloise Mumford of ""In the Blood""), who serves as the campus newspaper editor. As the action unfolds, woebegone, pajama-clad Kate is wrestling with a cold. Kate persuades Anastasia to pinch hit for her on a newspaper assignment. She sends her out to interview bachelor billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan of ""Marie Antoinette"") who rules a colossal corporate empire. Basically, Christian is the Bruce Wayne of hanky-spanky. An orphan who survived the death of his crack-addict mom, Christian has amassed a fortune, but he harbors a deep, dark secret. When she enters 'The House of Grey,' Anastasia knows little about him. Anxious about her assignment, Anastasia makes a klutz of herself when she enters Grey's office. No sooner has she crossed the threshold than she stumbles and crumples to her hands and knees. Realizing she hasn't made the best impression, Anastasia recovers her confidence and begins the interview. Initially, Christian adopts an icy attitude toward her, but he thaws out once they start talking. Christian finds the way Anastasia chews her lip so irresistible that he cancels his next appointment. Some of Kate's questions shock Anastasia, particularly when she quizzes the tycoon about his sexual orientation. A life-long bachelor who has never been photographed in public with a woman, Christian explains that he has little use for conventional romances with hearts and flowers. A relieved Anastasia leaves Christian behind in his phallic monolith of a building and cruises home. As it turns out, Anastasia is just as captivated with Christian as the latter is with her. Later, they go on a date, and eventually he deflowers her. He wants Anastasia to join him in a sexual liaison as a 'submissive' to his 'dominant.' Christian and she negotiate terms of a contract. For example, the open-minded Anastasia has no problems with being tied up and titillated with a peacock feather, but she draws the line at vaginal fisting and genital clamps. Meantime, Christian does everything he can to corrupt Anastasia, buying her a Mac notebook and replacing her classic Volkswagen Beetle with a shiny red Audi. Ultimately, Christian convinces our heroine to let him show her how bondage can be enjoyable. Nevertheless, Anastasia isn't as gullible as she seems. At fade-out, she gains the upper hand in their bizarre relationship.The casting in ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" creates half of the problem. Dakota Johnson makes an ideal Anastasia. She gives a believable performance as a naïve college student who has just graduated and treasures the kind classic 19th century British fiction that Thomas Hardy wrote. The Austin, Texas, born actress seems wholly comfortable with her casual nudity, and it is interesting to note that ""Miami Vice's"" Don Johnson is her dad and Melanie Griffith of ""Something Wild"" is her mom. She isn't as goofy as her literary counterpart. Sadly, lean, handsome Jamie Dornan doesn't cut the mustard. He doesn't behave like a ruthless cutthroat who owns a billion dollar corporation, and his performance is considerably less spontaneous. Although he wears his apparel well and delivers his dialogue with crisp precision, Dornan looks more like a callow amateur. In all fairness to Dornan, he impersonates a character that doesn't seem remotely believable, and his lack of personality underlines his lightweight performance. The other big problem is the film seems as impersonal as a bargain basement torture rack. Basically, Johnston and Marcel have designed it as a bondage primer that cautiously advances from one elaborate interlude to another without drumming up any melodrama. Primarily, the filmmakers rely more on winks rather than winces as our heroine navigates the dire straits of Christian's sexual calisthenics. Keep in mind, Anastasia doesn't say no until she knows better. Gradually, Christian peels back the layers of his paranoia, revealing himself as an onion that initiates our heroine's tears and fears. When director Sam Johnston shifts the focus from the game of sexual chess between Anastasia and Christian, the film sacrifices suspense. Undeniably, ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" will keep your eyes wide open, but it dwells more on tease instead of sleaze.",0
"50 Shades of Grey. The title suggests a nuanced film where nothing is black or white and motivations are murky and changeable.Nothing could be further from the truth, I'm afraid. Jimmy Dorman, who plays the titular Mr Grey, has all the nuance and subtlety of a sledgehammer. Further, his supposed sex appeal is non-existent. He's about as appealing as Pennywise the clown, from Stephen King's It, but about twice as creepy! Anastasia Steele, by contrast, gives the impression that she is of sub-par intelligence and is exactly as interesting as listening to your Grandpa's old war stories... for the hundredth time.There is an utter lack of anything like chemistry between the pair and their entire ""relationship"" is based around him abusing her and her supposedly enjoying it. Now, I don't have a problem with BDSM whatsoever, but the thing I do know about it is that it is entirely consensual between both parties. If it isn't, then it isn't BDSM, it's plain and simple abuse.Of course, there are those that would argue that, in the context of the movie, the ""consent"" was clear and obvious because the woman was content to let it happen. But that is treading on mighty thin ice, friends, and sounds more like justification, than any real argument as to consent.In short, this movie offended me and made me laugh all at the same time, which is rare for a movie to do. I think I was more non-plussed that anyone would find it entertaining and that, along with the awful chemistry and poor acting, made me find humour in it. But I suppose I'm an old fart because I find something distasteful about the subject material. I know, it is a work of fiction, and we should all be able to distinguish fantasy from reality, right? Well, yes, but I have the sneaking suspicion that, despite its ""R"" rating, an awful lot of young girls are going to see this movie and if so, then the message this movie sends to them is entirely the wrong one.But, enough of my preaching. It sucks. I looked at my watch many times during the film and went for a stroll around the foyer about half way through so that I might let my eyes witness more interesting things. There was a discarded movie stub that occupied me for several minutes, before I felt obligated to return to the auditorium for the second half of this dreary non-event.The fact that they released it the day before Valentine's Day just leaves me speechless with disbelief.EDIT: Of course this made a ton of money at the box office, so there will be a sequel, and plenty of similar, ripoffs. Remember when we all bemoaned the ""new"" craze of Young Adult, Dystopian fantasy films? Welcome to the next big genre folks! Soft-porn at the cinema!SUMMARY: Ridiculous, badly acted and lacking anything like entertainment. No chemistry between the two leads. Glorifies abuse and then tries to tell you that is what you wanted all along. Just a waste of your time. Trust me.",0
"Before the review, I think I should address one important thing: I have never read the book. That being said, you will not read any comparisons or critiques of what was left out or what was done wrong in the adaptation. I went into this movie aware of the subject matter and judged it just like any other movie. Consider this a fair review of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"".Honestly, I liked this movie. I know what you're thinking: ""This guy just likes seeing people have kinky sex on the big screen."" No, I don't. In fact, I think mainstream erotic films offer us more than just artsy porn; they can be a fascinating look into the human subconscious like ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and they can be pure garbage like ""Caligula"". I have come to learn that art is not safe whether it's in the horror genre, comedy or especially in the erotic subgenre. Strangely, I found ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" to be provocative of questions about love, compromise, and passion even if it borders on what most people would consider bad taste.First off, what is the movie about? Basically it follows the relationship between an inhibited English student named Anastasia Steele (played by Dakota Johnson) and a mysterious, young billionaire named Christian Grey (played by Jamie Dornan). They meet for an interview and begin building an infatuation for one another but Grey keeps insisting he does not want a romance with Ana. Instead he offers her the chance to partake in a BDSM relationship in which he is the dominant and she is the submissive. When I look back, the roles match well with their personalities.There is no real story I could find in this film; rather it's more about the characters. A lot of great movies focus on their characters more than plot; in this movie, it works out okay. Many of the supporting characters are snubbed for the two main players as if to say they are just there for the sake of some filler. Maybe if others found out about Grey's lifestyle and he was caught in media frenzy, the film would have a substantial plot.I found Dakota Johnson to be incredibly dull in the first act but gradually she becomes more dynamic and confident as the film progressed. It feels intentional seeing how Ana starts off as a quiet, uninteresting woman only to morph into a more liberal persona. Dakota's character has a lot of those ""whomp-whomp-whomp-whooooomp"" comedic moments in the beginning which felt so forced and unnecessary to the tone. Jamie Dornan was decent as Christian Grey. Like his character, he feels in control.The sex scenes are a lot tamer than I had anticipated going into this flick. Like the rest of the movie, they are shot surprisingly crisp and, might I add, nicely-paced.It sounds like a simple movie but it wasn't until I asked myself one simple question that it all became interesting: Does Grey love Ana? A lot of Grey's actions I see points to yes unless it is part of a ploy to secure a potential submissive. He claims to require a written contract before ever touching Ana but blows off this condition to passionately kiss her. And once they get to the contract, they discuss their intimate limitations in an amusing, business-like setting. Ana objects to certain practices which Grey seems to willingly extract from their relationship kind of like a compromise in any other relationship.One of my favorite parts is when Ana confesses her virginity to Grey after revealing his secret life. Even though he maintains he doesn't have normal sexual relations in the bedroom, Grey breaks this code to be with Ana. One might argue it is a selfish act to gain her trust so she may serve as his victim; I see it as Grey finding an opportunity to be with someone he could briefly connect with, someone untouched, someone he sees as good. In fact, at one point, he voices his concern of Ana changing his outlook on life and sounds scared of this prospect. Grey feels constrained by his past which shaped his present only to feel the need to constrain others to his level, literally.Who knows? Maybe I'm overthinking too much. Some people might be turned off, some might get turned on, some might think little about it, and some might find something special in ""Fifty Shades of Grey"". I only know what I saw and felt.My Rating: 7/10",0
"Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan had zero sex appeal, for me anyway. I hoped I was going to see something a bit more provocative than predictable. However, what unfolded on the screen was a story without enough substance. So I grabbed the first hard cover volume from my aunt's large collection of ""literature."" She warned me not to expect much and she was right. I somehow got through 150 pages of poorly written boredom and gave up. I'm glad I saw the film for free. On the positive side, I can report that the Music is by one of my favorite film composers, Danny Elfman. Plus, the soundtrack includes music from the likes of Beyonce, Ellie Golding and many others which helps but does not rescue the largely silly visual acrobatics. Maybe my opinion would be different were I a repressed housewife or middle aged spinster. But that is as stupid a remark as the movie itself, given I am a man.",0
"I have to say right from the start that I read the entire first book and that I thought it was absolutely horrible - badly written erotica at best with a lame plot and a horribly pathetic female lead and a very unlikeable hero (who was no hero to me).That out of the way, I saw Jamie Dornan was cast and heard they changed a lot of the story for the movie script and thought maybe it would be OK, but it wasn't.I counted 10 people who left at some part during the movie and never came back, which is rare these days as people tend to stay to get their money's worth out of the price of the ticket.The settings are nice at times and so is the music, but the acting (Jamie what were you thinking????) was so wooden. It was almost like a Saturday Night Live skit, except they weren't playing for laughs in this movie they were serious, but it was cringeworthy at best.Christian Grey is no hero, and Dakota Johnson was so understated it was like she wasn't even there at all.Not a good movie - definitely not a date movie (I was so irritated by it by the time I left, no one was getting lucky!).The good parts of the movie - really the music is the best part and the end, because it was finally over - could have been a good 20 minutes shorter! The bad parts - the script was like a really bad 1960's Mills & Boon romance, and it was so slow you could honestly fall asleep if the acting weren't so painfully wooden.If you are looking for a good mainstream movie to watch to get turned on, find one on Netflix, Google movies that are sexy, you'll find something much more titillating.I am so glad some of the actors who were originally considered decided to say no, this movie could be a career killer! I hope it isn't the number 1 movie this week purely because it would be a shame if this drivel is what Americans actually want to watch and think is sexy. Men of course will enjoy the naked parts, of course they will, Dakota has a nice body, but as a woman, I don't ever want to be as wussy as Anastasia and I sure don't want women in general thinking it's OK to be abused by a guy in the name of sex.Being tied up is great in a committed relationship, it's fun, it's NOT abusive - BUT in this movie, it's creepy, borderline degrading and just uncomfortable.The funniest part for me (apart from the script!) was how uncomfortable the men who had clearly come in with their wives thinking they were going to get lucky later, and clearly wanted to leave and couldn't. Hilarious! I gave it a 1 out of 10 because you can't go any lower and the music really was quite good, but everything else, give this one a miss and wait for the UV code to come out - at least you won't waste as much money as 2 movie tickets, drinks, popcorn etc, and there's an OFF button on the ROKU, so you can switch this crapola off and just go have sex with your partner instead.",0
Well I thought I would see what all the fuss was about and boy did I wish I hadn't I have seen very bad romantic comedies that are better than this film,0
"Remember I said there was a special place in hell where they torture Hitler with Twilight and Nicolas Sparks movies? Yo dawg, we based a movie on a book based on a Twilight fan fiction so you can remember the horror of Twilight while memorizing the new horror of 50 shades of gray.While advertised as a BDSM erotic movie/book, 50 Shades is rather a rape fantasy. I am thankful the tampon sex scene was not included; that would be an extra nail in the movie's coffin.But I guess the bad writing is not so visible in the movie form; and the average sexually dissatisfied overweight housewife might still enjoy it.",0
"Let me resume it. Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing...The actors are really the worst pick. For a movie that lives of sexuality they went with actors that have no idea what that means.The writing is just appalling, that is no story, is just more of the same, a page out off that awful vampire franchise, and it even got the same card board actors. But little girls and horny housewife's will love it The directing, just went all over the place. The main focus was with aesthetics, no content what so ever.There are amazing love and or sex story's out there, this in not the case... now let's wait for part 2 and 3. I have no doubt it will sell like crazy but not because of it's film merits that is so clear to me.",0
"Seldom has an R-rated movie arrived in theaters with more pre-release hype, anticipation – and misunderstanding – than ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" (R, 2:05). What is billed and understood (at least by those who haven't read British author E. L. James' novel) as simply a story of a young woman being introduced to one man's sexual fetishes is much more – and much deeper – than one might expect. Nevertheless, the nudity, sex, and eroticism are on full display throughout the movie. This film, the book on which it is based, and this review are not for the faint-of-heart or the easily offended.Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson, daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson) is an attractive and intelligent college senior in Washington State who fills in for her sick roommate, Kate (Eloise Mumford) in interviewing billionaire business magnate Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for the college newspaper. Anastasia (Ana to her friends, except to Christian, who consistently uses her full first name) gets flustered in the presence of this young, sophisticated, supremely-confident and mysterious man. For his part, Christian is quite taken with Ana – and take her is what he soon decides he wants to do. He shows up at the hardware store where she works, takes her out to coffee and even comes to ""rescue"" her when she drunk dials him from a bar. Despite how obvious it is to the main characters and to the audience that these two are very, very different – and despite the title character's own conflicted resistance – these two twenty-somethings cannot resist each other.In most love stories, after setting up the situation like I did in that last paragraph, I'd say ""romance blooms"" (or something to that effect), but Christian very clearly states, ""I don't do romance."" That doesn't stop Ana from being drawn to this man and wondering about the ""various physical pursuits"" he says he likes and his ""singular"" tastes, as he describes them. As Ana discovers more about the cipher that is Christian, she learns that he is wounded – both emotionally and physically – by his childhood. She seems to want to comfort this man who acts as if he needs no comforting and begins to love this man who tells her that he is only interested in her for sex.Being the woman in Christian Grey's life means submitting completely – sexually and otherwise – to his whims. As he eases her towards an understanding and acceptance of his lifestyle, she has to sign a non-disclosure agreement, he convinces her to have sex (actually ""f--- hard"", as he describes it) and then shows her his ""playroom."" This usually locked room is painted dark red, has a bed and is filled with various restraining devices and implements of sadomasochistic sex play. Ana is shocked, but not necessarily repulsed. She's curious.Christian presents her his thick contract which describes Ana's prospective role as his submissive. He urges her to read the contract, educate herself on being a submissive and ""keep an open mind."" She does all that, while Christian waits impatiently for Ana to make a decision. What follows is a complicated dance in which both parties kid themselves about how it's going. He seems confident that she's warming to the idea of being his sex slave and she is convincing herself that he is becoming boyfriend material. Ana does draw closer to Christian's world in fits and starts and Christian seems to be working harder to draw Ana in than he has probably ever worked before. No spoilers here, but eventually the true nature of each character does come out and the film ends with two words that carry more emotion than any six syllables I can remember hearing in any movie in a very long time.A given audience member's reaction to this movie will likely be influenced by how she or he feels about Christian's lifestyle, but evaluating this film solely on those criteria misses the point. Yes, the nudity and sex are enticing and anyone paying to see this movie for those scenes will be more than satisfied, but you'll get more than eroticism for your money. Much like ""Boogie Nights"", director Paul Thomas Anderson's engrossing 1997 meditation on the 70s porn industry, this film is an examination of human relationships. ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is a love story, a parable of male and female emotional and sexual roles in the 21st century and an exploration of a lifestyle which many people know very little about, but very few know much. Basically, this is simply an entertaining movie. Casting little-known actors in the main roles is very effective and both show more emotional range than I expected from simply watching the movie's theatrical trailer. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson paces the movie well and she skillfully balances the film's salacious nature with its deeper meanings. ""B+""",0
"There was absolutely no chemistry between the main actors. The sex is about as sensual as a log of wood thrown on the road. The sets and art direction are excellent and create the perfect ambiance. The music is all right in terms of theme and pacing. She was irritating and there were way too many close-ups of her. Neither her features nor her mannerism could hold it. He was every bit of gorgeous, but with a rather wooden performance; no pun intended, because he's as sensual as last year's sock. Will I be watching Part II ? NAY. Will I be reading any of the books ? NAY.",0
"FIFTY SHADES OF GREY is a film every bit as bad as you've heard. The screen adaptation of the best-selling erotic novel exploring the topic of bondage, you can tell this started out as a piece of Internet fan fiction, based on the TWILIGHT saga, that became inexplicably popular. It's like a cheesy Mills & Boon romance with some unexpectedly dark subject matter involving violence against women, and yet some women seem to get a kick out of this. I don't see why.As a film, this is a dog. Badly-scripted by someone with a tin ear for natural-sounding dialogue, and with embarrassingly wooden performances from the two leads. The much-hyped sex scenes feature extensive nudity and lots of athletic moments, but not once is any of it erotic or appealing. Instead it feels cheap, tawdry, and rather sleazy. I can't believe they've made sequels, either.",0
"The version I saw was via a pirate copy marked ""CENSORED"" which probably means most of the explicit shots in the sex scenes have been cut out . . I thought I had to mention this due to covering my back . Apparently a lot of people have been watching this film for the dubious and much hyped reason that this film is supposed to be the greatest aphrodisiac ever recorded in human history . Indeed I almost fell out of my seat reading a report in the Scottish Daily Record that a woman in her thirties had been arrested in a Glasgow cinema for ""pleasuring herself"" ! Hold your horses guys because the paper didn't print a photo of the woman in question due to sub-judicial law so hoping she's going to pop back to the cinema for a repeat performance while she sits beside you is a little bit premature , she could have been a Gorgon for all we know . But I suppose 50 SHADES has something in its favour if audience members are going to risk 5 years on the sex offenders register watching it in public . I do hope the uncensored sex scenes are worth it because if the censored version is anything to go by that woman in the Glasgow cinema might have been pleasuring herself in order to stay awake The story itself is very one note . Unconfident virgin undergraduate Ana Steele embarks on a sexual relationship with 27 year old multi-billionaire Christian Grey . There's some strange casting going on here . Dakota Johnson as Ana really overplays the shy innocent virgin routine in the early part of the film and Jamie Doran never convinces as Grey . ""I don't do romance and I'm singular"" states Grey . How about ""I don't do acting and I have a single expression on my face throughout the entire movie"" Jamie ? Maybe if Grey was played by someone like a younger Christian Bale who can do a convincing turn as a manly Byronic anti-hero which is the casting that Grey calls for . The characters as played here just do not convince but to be fair to Johnson and Doran it's every aspect of the entire film that's the problem . It's directed by Sam Taylor Johnson who gives the entire mis en scene the look of a TVM on the Hallmark Channel complete with irritating incidental muzak playing over scenes . The source novel is probably complete garbage and if it is screenwriter Kelly Marcel hasn't improved it . Take this brief snippet of dialogue as Grey is just about introduce Ana to his S&M den ""This is my playroom"" states Grey ""You have an X-box in there ?"" Ana asks in all seriousness I know she's supposed to be an innocent virgin but would any young woman be that naïve ? My shopping list has as much chance for being nominated for an Oscar as this film does . Honestly I know sex sells but there's good sex and bad sex and in cinematic terms this really is bad sex and couldn't get much worse unless a self pleasuring Gorgon was sitting in the cinema seat beside you",0
"I was in the mood for a great film about a young girl who meets a successful and seductive businessman with sexy results. This was not the case. This film was purely awful. No one can blame me for not being in the right frame of mind for the cinema, as some reviewers are. They see a film and end up having a bad night and they put the entire blame on the film, this is not the case for me. I was in a positive frame of mind, and really in the mood to see what I thought would be a somewhat good if not better than mediocre film.This film is about two people who have no chemistry ""falling"" for each other. ""Falling"" like off a three story balcony leaving you without the use of your legs for the rest of your life. I'm just going to be blunt. This film is about GLORIFYING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE and a little girl in over her head who tolerates it. The man in the relationship, Chris, in a career-ending performance portrayed by Jamie Doormat, is a control-freak who must be in control in everything he does, including the life of his BDSM buddy, Ana.Not only does he creep onto her, HE BEATS HER, non-consensually while they have intercourse, he stalks her, HE INTIMIDATES HER and he shows no love for her. If this were any other film, he would be the antagonist. If you're in the mood for a movie that shows what true love is, I suggest you see Mrs. Doubtfire, as that film is about a loving family man who shows his dedication and support to his wife, even after they are separated, and his children, by dressing up as an elderly female babysitter. 50 Shades of Brown gets 1/10 stars from me as I am unable to give A BIG FAT ZERO.",0
"Lifestyles of the Rich and Perverse might be a more fitting title for the unusually explicit bedroom drama.This adaptation of a trilogy of novels by E.L. James -- which features a modern-day Marquis de Sade as its male protagonist -- has a pornographically narrow focus and a potentially dangerous message.James, whose real name is Erika Mitchell, has apparently captured the imaginations of bored housewives everywhere by tracing the unlikely romance between socially awkward college student Anastasia and intimidating business tycoon Christian Grey.The popularity -- and notoriety -- of James' fiction is such that moviegoers know from the outset that the stumbling block tripping these two up, as they attempt to tango, will be Christian's fondness for whips and chains. Thus the duo's first interaction -- which comes about when Ana agrees to fill in for her ailing roommate Kate, a journalism major, by interviewing Christian for the campus newspaper -- is loaded down with dramatic irony.All Ana knows is that Christian has been tapped to deliver the commencement address at her pending graduation. But we're on to this dungeon-loving Bruce Wayne's real identity. So his sly double entendres are ever so much fun.In between the zingers, Ana and Christian fall for each other. Yet, as Ana tries to bond with her aloof new beau, she's perplexed by his total lack of hearts-and-flowers romanticism. Until, that is, she discovers that he's an obsessive sadist with an elaborately equipped ""playroom"" full of pain-inducing gadgets and restraints.Though it's framed in the familiar context of a good girl's crusade to redeem a naughty boy, Ana's eventual cooperation with Christian's perversion, risks conveying the idea that all women are potentially willing victims of physical abuse and humiliation. We're also left to wonder what role Christian's helicopter and fancy penthouse pad play in rendering Ana so tractable.While responsible viewers might sympathize with Christian's troubled background, both in childhood and beyond, as well as with his passing acknowledgement of the harmful nature of his proclivities, the intent to stir audiences by teasing a supposed taboo is unmistakable.Sadly, but essentially (at the risk of repeating) this 'fantasy' promotes all the worst things (mostly violence) on the ""person"" (esp women): ie: stalk, do harm (physically n psychologically), prostitute (money), pornography upon women .. and bring down the dignity of men anyway that's my piece... the movie is -10, but the chart doesn't have that option :-)",0
"Fifty shades is an awful film no doubt, but it had to be made no question, and here is why. Purely from an economic standpoint Comcast, that owns Universal had no choice. How could they say to their share holders that they passed on such a cash cow, allowing Warner, Fox or Sony to rake in the profits that this movie is guaranteed to make. The board meeting probably went something like this.""We have an option on this book 'Fifty Shades of Grey- Now this one of the worst books ever to be written, but bear with me here, because this book is selling like hotcakes to desperate housewives everywhere. It's a no brainer we have to make this movie. The great thing is that we don't even need to make a good movie, it only has to be almost as good as the book, and since the book is so bad to begin with, that means that the bar is already set very low. We just can't fail. It's not Lord of Rings, the fan base isn't looking for great quality, if they were they wouldn't have bought the book in the first place, and that means we don't need to spend much money developing the script. Neither do we need to waste money on any A list talent. Forget Tom Cruise, and Keira Knightly, just get a couple or relatively unknown actors, they don't even need to be that good as long as they can remember their lines. And we don't need to budget for a great director either. Let's face it we are not remaking Citizen Kane here, so keep Spielberg and Scorcese for another project. Heck, we don't even need to pay out for someone like Ridley Scott and he'll pretty much do anything these days. No an unknown mediocre director will do, but make sure that the director is a woman as it will help to deflect any negative PR from those folks that think fifty shades glorifies domestic abuse and the like.Now here is the best part. Here is how we can make a ton of money out of this steaming dung pile. There are two days in the year when even the most Jockiest of alpha male guys who normally only watch action movies will happily take their significant other to see a chick flick. One is on her birthday, and the other is Valentines day. Since birthdays fall every day of the year, then February 14th has to be the release date. Oh and as luck would have it, Valentines day this year falls on a Saturday, so not only will all the male schmucks who think taking their girl to see this pic will get them laid later, all the single ladies who don't want to be stuck inside on this evening will come out to see this movie in droves with their girlfriends. Seriously guys, we've been handed a gift horse. Let's green light this thing and make ourselves a huge pile of cash"".",0
"Another sad movie with a generic plot with the Mary Sue / Gary Sue relationship. A relationship so horrid that it reaches a limit when rape is involved. This book turned movie is a mere reminder that 'Hollywood' will create anything without investigating the rather obvious 'unusual behavior' -- which, lets be honest here, isn't unusual until you put a married man and a girl who cannot bite her lip for the life of her in the same room. It is more than evident there is no chemistry on set, and off set. Jamie, you could have done so much better. Dakota, no, just no. Thank you, EL for your horrible outlook on BDSM and your plagiarized mistake of a 'book'. You truly have given writers everywhere a reason to wish they'd never written, and a reason as to why actors never wish to take part in anything that relates to this horrible mess of a movie.",0
"Samantha and Zach get married. For their honeymoon, they went to visit the Dominican Republic. One night there, they were brought by their taxi driver to a mysterious place where they get drunk and drugged. Nevertheless, they still managed to get back home safe and sound. Not long after, Samantha finds out she was with child. From there, the further along the pregnancy Samantha got, the more bizarre and more violent behavior she would display. As she nears her due date, can Zach still do anything to avert the diabolical fate that seems to await his wife and baby?Like many current horror films, ""Devil's Due"" is told through camera footage. Aside from the cameras Zach and characters carried around, there was also footage from security cameras. The first thirty minutes were practically just needless wedding coverage. When it got around to telling the story, the pace was also quite slow. Mundane daily events like going to the supermarket or the obstetrician were punctuated by some disgusting or violent scenes which would have been a big deal had it happened in real life. Here, they happened, but there seemed to have been no consequences that follow their occurrence.The best moments of this film were those scenes showing Samantha's repulsive eating habits, her super-telekinetic powers, and her effect on Catholic priests. The rest of the film was unfortunately forgettable, all the way up to the predictable climax. 3/10.",0
"The orphan Samantha (Allison Miller) gets married with Zach McCall (Zach Gilford) and they travel in honeymoon to Santo Domingo. In their last night in the Dominican Republic, the newlywed couple is invited by a taxi driver to go to a party in the outskirts of Santo Domingo. They drink too much and do not see that Sam is brought to a weird cult. They return to the United States and soon Sam discovers that she is pregnant. Along the pregnancy, Sam changes her behavior and becomes nervous and aggressive. On the night of the delivery, Zach witnesses weird events at home. ""Devil's Due"" is a lame and cheap movie that uses the same storyline of ""Rosemary's Baby"". This rip-off could have the title ""How to Destroy the Storyline of a Masterpiece with a Hand-held Camera and an Absurd Plot"". Sam and Zach accepting to go to a slum in an unknown country with a stranger are among the greatest stupidities of the cinema industry. The new doctor uses the office of Dr. J. Ludka and no receptionist or nurse notices. The house of Sam and Zach is completely destroyed in a calm neighborhood and no neighbor observes. The use of camera as if it were Zach is nonsense in most of the situations. My vote is two.Title (Brazil): ""O Herdeiro do Diabo"" (""Devil's Due"")",0
"Devil's Due follows a young newlywed couple who find out they're expecting a child after returning home from their honeymoon in the Dominican Republic. Shortly into the pregnancy, mother-to-be Allison begins having unusual symptoms, and it appears that she and her husband are being watched by some sort of secret society who are awaiting the birth of one of the ""many"" antichrists.Cleverly prefaced with scripture from John, ""Devil's Due"" sets out on a road oft-followed in the found footage sub genre of horror films, charting terrorized couples and Satanic magic wreaking havoc on suburbia. That said, the film has a few interesting aspects; first off, it's not really a ""found footage"" film. Although much of the narrative is dispensed through home video footage which is recorded by the couple themselves, the film also utilizes surveillance footage from public spaces as well as the cameras secretly placed in their home to help tell the story. In other words, it is not a film claiming to be a ""true story"" ""discovered"" as a cohesive piece of found footage. It's in all actuality a fairly standard horror movie that is told through the medium of hand-held video and surveillance without the claims of being real or ""found"", and for that, I found the film mildly refreshing. I roll my eyes every time I see a found footage horror film claiming to be reality (""The Devil Inside"" comes to mind), but ""Devil's Due"" makes no bones about anything of the sort, and in that sense is very much aware of itself and doesn't rest solely on its pretensions.Secondly, I can't not praise the acting in this film. The other downfall of most ""found footage"" films is that they star unknown actors who often have little experience and/or talent, and thus tend to have less-than-stellar acting, which just cheapens films that are already cheap to begin with. That's not the case with ""Devil's Due"". Zach Gilford plays the concerned husband role both behind and in front of the camera, and is convincing in the role; however, Allison Miller is the one who really carries the film. Her performance in this was wonderful in general, and especially wonderful in a film of this type. Very naturalistic and totally believable. My praise even goes for the minor roles; all of the acting in the film does feel genuine, which really elevates this above other hand-held horror fare.Narratively, the film is definitely imperfect. Some people have claimed the film is boring, which, while it does take time to get going, the slow burn nature of it allows for some subtle scares to creep in over an extended period (also, there isn't much for jump scares here either, which I was really surprised by). That said, the film does lack steam at times, and propels itself into a conclusion that doesn't reveal as much excitement or surprise as the preceding 80 minutes would lead you to believe is coming. The finale is pretty weak, and follows a pattern that's been done before in other found footage genre films. That's not to say that a horror film requires a twist ending to be worthy (which this film surprisingly doesn't have), but there's not a whole lot of payoff in terms of anything truly shocking or nuanced occurring in the film's final act, and for that, it is predictable. There's a lot of build-up for a pretty mediocre ending.All things considered, ""Devil's Due"" is an oddball in the sub genre in which it's been placed. The film doesn't make any claims to reality, doesn't ascribe to jump scares or a surprise ending, has shockingly worthwhile performances, and, most importantly, isn't actually a ""found footage"" movie at all. The references to ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"" are indubitable, and despite the film's burnout ending, I still was mildly happy with it, probably because it did the opposite of what I expected it to do in a lot of ways. The flip side of that is that the film doesn't have much in way of surprises, but the above-average performances and a handful of crafty scenes elevated it above any other hand-held and/or found footage horror film to come out in the past five years. 6/10.",0
Another film where the camera tells the story! A cult looks for couples which the cult victimizes the couples with a nasty pregnancy. What works is the actors and director comes across as real life. I like how the characters' behaviour is detailed with little quirks. Devil's Due's strongest asset is the story's linear progression of events slowly getting worse. As usual the story's protagonist pieces together the bizarre event too little to late. Devil's due is another homage similar to Blair Witch and the Paranormal series. The originality of the camera telling the story genre is getting old. Still a watchable movie. I give Devil's Due a six or seven out of ten. Depending if you like horror movies. Does everyone always have to expire in these films?,0
"DEVIL'S DUE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another low-budget supernatural horror 'found footage' flick. The story is about a recently wed woman who unexpectedly becomes pregnant, with the Antichrist. It's an homage to the classic Roman Polanski thriller 'ROSEMARY'S BABY' but it's presented in a style that's a lot more similar to the 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY' franchise. It was written by Lindsay Devlin (who's only other film writing credit is the 2013 documentary 'IN SO MANY WORDS') and directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett. Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett are part of a collective filmmakers group called 'Radio Silence'; they previously co-directed, co-wrote and co-starred in a segment of the 2012 'found footage' horror anthology 'V/H/S'. I think the filmmaking duo did an exceptional job on this (their debut feature film) and found it to be much better than a lot of critics (and 'found footage' movie haters) have made it out to be.The story revolves around a newly wed couple, named Samantha and Zach McCall (played by Allison Miller and Zach Gilford), that go on their honeymoon in the Dominican Republic. After Samantha gets a weird reading from a fortune teller the two are led to a remote bar (outside the city) by a persistent cab driver (Roger Payano). They both get wasted (on shots) and pass out. It then appears that Samantha is taken to a room, beneath the club, where some kind of ritual is performed on her. When they return home they find out she's pregnant, despite the fact that Samantha has always regularly taken her birth control pills. The two decide to keep the child and then things really get strange. It's of course all caught on video and compiled (from many different sources) for the viewer.The film (like I said) got mostly bad reviews from critics and horror fans (that hate the 'found footage' genre). It did get a few good reviews (though) from some scary movie aficionados (like director Eli Roth and the popular horror website 'Bloody Disgusting'). I enjoyed the movie; I love the horror genre and like 'found footage' flicks, when they're done right. I think this one was done right; it's scary, funny and just a lot of fun to watch. The rookie directors did a great job and the script is smart and clever as well. The two leads were also adequate enough (for a film like this); the lead woman is very beautiful too and the lead guy reminds me a lot of a political radio and internet talk show host (I watch) named David Pakman. It's just an all around good fright flick, especially if you like the genre. Ignore the haters!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhLjf_1MKw",0
"I heard this was going to be a good film! Not big on the Found Footage horror genre but this was a great horror film!Had some jump Scares here & there! Not to mention some weird moments! Like the part when Sam's eating raw meat in the supermarket! The part when Sam flips out at the car reversing smashing the windows with her fists! That was mental! The priest snapping suddenly in the hospital! The teens in the woods getting killed off by Sam whose eating animals insides! The cam SD card (containing the footage of Sam in the ritual) going missing!The film it'self was dark & creepy! The man staring up at the house was creepy! Though the story-line didn't make sense in a way, though I didn't focus on that so much! It was bloody at the end! Had some gory moments! Bleeding noses etc! The part where Sam cuts into the womb! Ouch! The ending was sad as Sam dies & this creepy old man & creepy black taxi driver take the baby away! Then him being questioned by officers! Then the ending where the creepy black taxi driver goes after another couple! Slightly typical ending! Overall I'd say a 8.5/10 for this one! A decent horror film!",0
"Oh the irony. I am a true horror fan from way back. I love it all except for the rage of ""found footage"" ""hand cam"" horror. The Blair Witch Project was brilliant and since then film makers have been beating this style of film to death and beyond. I am sick of it quite frankly. I won't even go out of my way to watch one and usually when I find out a horror flick is ""found footage"" it gets shut off. But I wanted to see this one through. The irony is how poorly this is scored on IMDb. I thought this was world's better than the awful Paranormal Activity: Marked Ones and the truly unfortunate thing is if they had bothered to make this just a regular old horror film it could have been terrifying and thrilling and a possible ten because the performances in the movie border on excellent believe it or not. The story is stale...I will agree with many others. We have seen this story done again and again and again (thank you Rosemary's Baby and The Omen.) However, for being same old it is well written and follows the necessary predictable recipe. It actually got to the point where I was literally saying out loud what was going to happen next. This sounds like ear mark of a terrible movie but it wasn't terrible. I wanted to know where the story was going, what was going to happen with this young, formerly happy couple and I did feel some heart palpitations with some scenes so bravo to them for that. I am certain if you switch the lights out and sit back you'll be at least a little scared.Part of the reason I think the film was so much better than it should have been was our lead cast and couple. Allison Miller is excellent as Samantha, the mother to be. We are introduced to her the night before her wedding so by the time the changes take effect we sort of see how different she is. She seems like such a happy and normal woman who you can relate to. She plays it very down to earth making her transformation terrifying and she really does a great job. Its a shame she's wasted on an uber-generic found footage horror. Not to be outdone in any way Zach Gilford is also very good as her doting husband. Gilford gets less scenes in front of the camera because he is often behind it filming (how irritatingly stupid.) He also does a terrific job and his intensity in the later scenes really holds the film together. The two of them have truly outstanding chemistry and it really gives this film a lot of credibility to have them in it. There isn't a big supporting cast and no one stands out amongst them but I will mention I love character actor Sam Anderson who has a small and very creepy role as Father Thomas.Honestly, they could have made this one of the best horror films of 2014 if they just filmed it like your every day movie. Every scene I kept thinking this would be so much better, more terrifying and just more fun to watch if it weren't through the supposed eyes of a home movie camera. It shouldn't surprise me though that the directors behind this were also the people responsible for V/H/S a movie I gave a total of ten minutes too before I shut it off. This is superior to V/H/S but they also got a much bigger budget. The only other glaring issue with Devil's Due is it goes on too long. It is the average movie length but you begin to feel like the same thing is happening over and over again. Even during the climatic scenes when all hell breaks loose (pun fully intended) it seems to just keep going when it should get to the point. Still the ending is not disappointing and I found myself wide eyed more than once. Finally when the baby is born...well it's all kinds of messed up and the scene is more than disturbing. Devil's Due is different from something like Paranormal Activity because I don't think they're trying to make you feel like its real. There are some pretty outrageous scenes of telekinetic ability and devil possession that would have best suited a regular horror film (I'm never going to let it go.) Still if you are a fan of the found footage genre...first of all...I'm sorry that you are but this one is of a much better quality than the other junk out there. You could do far worse and while I would never watch it again I enjoyed my first viewing. 6.5/10",0
"First of all, I am a big fan of the found footage supernatural/horror genre and love watching even the lesser acclaimed films. I am the type of viewer that draws the positives out of a very flawed film and enjoy it. So I expected to enjoy something out of this at the very least. My god, what a tediously insufferable film this turned out to be.There is absolutely no innovation or any attempt to try something new. It is so painfully boring.The concept idea was very promising which is basically a found footage rendition of The Omen or Rosemary's baby. However, this film is so dire at engaging the audience due to the most irritable protagonist I have ever seen so far in a found footage type movie. For more than half of the movie, we are tortured with the sickly saccharine antics of a doting husband on his newly wed wife. There is no natural humour to ease the torment and worse for a film of this type, there were actually no scares until the last act.As I said, I am the type of film goer that draws the positives and try enjoy that. So are there any? Well, there is a dog that was amusing for 2 seconds but even he looked bored, thereafter. OK, there is a bit more positives. You do get a predictable climax in an attempt to ""reward "" us for our eternal patience which was efficiently executed but without any unique vision or flair, just the usual creep around corridors and...""boo"" oh it was just the dog sort of thing. The actors do perform well but the material they have to work with is revolting.At the end of the credits there is a piece of text explaining that this film created 200,000 jobs. Well that was nice to know and the only bit that made me feel good knowing that at least it gave a lot of people work but then I wonder if stating that was an indirect apology and their justification to make this dreadfully boring movie?TO be fair, the film is as polished as it can be for a found footage genre but its all pointless if it fails to engage us in the narrative. If you haven't seen many horror films or supernatural films such as Paranormal Activity etc, then perhaps you might enjoy this more as long as you can stomach the vomit inducing newly weds for half of the movie. I give this a 3/10 rating, mostly for the dog that looked fairly convincing in not wanting to be in the movie. Get a new agent doggy, you deserve better.",0
"Absolute Dogsh*t is a term that cannot be used enough to describe this movie. I hated the characters (especially the tw*t of a husband), the stupid shaky-cam, the ""scares"", the pathetic sub-plot of an ancient cult, the trailer that gave away absolutely everything, and did I mention the tw*t of a husband? No doubt there'll be a sequel, and another, and another. Remember when there were actually good horror found-footage films? Me neither. Hollywood is just saturated with them, none of them good. A complete and terrible rip-off of Rosemary's Baby. Just don't watch it. If I could give it a minus rating I would. Definitely in the category of one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",0
"This was really deceptive marketing and hype that drew me into this movie. I am very sorry I went. The acting, directing, production design, continuity, editing and of course the story, screen writing and execution were just abysmal. There was nothing of quality in this film. The characters were stupid, the camera work was jarring ""handheld reality TV"" nonsense and on top of it all, the plot was told in a far superior manner by Roman Polanski in ""Rosemary's Baby"" forty years ago! It just shows that with some production money, a digital camera and some reality-TV ""Blair Witch""/""Paranormal Activity""-type marketing approach, you can sell any kind of garbage to the American public. I urge you not to support this film, or any future endeavours of anyone involved with this project (cast, crew, director or screenwriters)....",0
"1st watched 1/18/2014 – 4 out of 10(Dir:Matt Bettinelli-Olpin & Tyler Gillet): Eerie story about a wife's possession by the Devil to attempt to produce one of his own thru her. The movie is filmed entirely in first person similar to the Blair Witch Project but more like Cloverfield --- but unfortunately the point of view changes which makes it kind of confusing. It starts as a newlywed couple vacation on their honeymoon in the Dominican Republic. Nothing is really revealed abnormal about the couple except that the wife is a foster child with a supposed past hard life. They are having a typical good time, but then decide to take a detour to an underground party after being coaxed by a local taxi driver. After they get a little too toasted we see a brief glimpse of some footage at a strange religious ceremony, but then are taken back to footage of them arriving from their vacation back into their new home. We find out later that ceremony has much to do about what happens next. The wife becomes pregnant despite being on the pill, and immediately starts suspecting that there are problems with the baby. She then starts doing strange things like eating raw meat at a grocery store(despite being a vegetarian), causing preachers to cough up blood, and taking night walks into the wild to kill deer and munch of their innardsso naturally the husband starts questioning something awry is going on.you think?? The movie is scary at times but because it is so predictable you just wait for the eerie things to happen(and they do). There is eventually a story told here that makes some sense as to why things happened but there are a lot of holes to it as well. I will leave out a lot of the specifics just in case you want to watch this movie about an antichrist possession.i'm not sure why I wanted to watch it myselfI think I was just challenging myselfbut overall this is just not that great of a movie, and the creepy feeling only lasted for a short while after the movie was over.",0
"The trailer and the plot attracted me to it and I went to the movies with low expectations as it is a fact that from all the horror films just a few are good; yes, it is another one in the wave of cam-on-hand films,so if you don't like them avoid this one. The length of the movie is appropriate and it even feels slow during the first 40 min but then the last 30 min are pure entertainment...good visual effects, good scares, great sound and a pessimistic and horrible feeling on how things will end. Both of the main characters are well in their parts, good connection with the audience, you really feel bad for the poor guy. Also, if you search for something original search somewhere else, this formula has been repeated endless times but for me it works just fine.",0
"A newlywed couple go on their Honeymoon, and like the responsible adults they. Are,go to a weird nightclub as advised by a shady cab driver......all the while filming it.They get home and soon they discover that they are pregnant.....all the while filming it.Soon the wife's hormones are everywhere and she starts eating raw meat, causing priests to have strokes, and generally being abhorrent.....all the while being filmed.Call it what you want, horror, misunderstood love story, macabre romance, nothing can hide the fact that it's just another found footage movie, albeit with different uses of the medium, but it still isn't anything to write home about.Its Rosemary's Baby for the ADHD generation, and if you've seen the more popular found footage movies (aka, the first ones were quite good, so the makers decided to cash in on them big time), you've seen everything on offer here.On the plus side,the acting isn't too bad, and the scares are kept to a minimum, concentrating more on the dissolving relationship of the couple.Eli Roth apparently loved it, but sewer rats like sewage, so it's really nothing to put on the poster.And the ending is ridiculous.",0
"I'm going to be generous here and give a 2! mainly because I hate giving 1's unless I walk out. This film came out about 3 weeks after paranormal 5, and I was one of the rare people who loved that film.I'm a big horror fan but this wasn't a horror in the slightest! the acting is beyond terrible, the lead two were absolutely awful. I'm not sure how this film got made as its just so bad. No body in this cinema jumped even once, and this is the type of film you should jump at.The effects at the end were cool but literally you could walk into this film about 45 minutes through and you wouldn't have missed anything. The plot wasn't explained very well either which was a big let down as I though the idea for the film was good.The ""enemy"" in this film weren't really explained either, nobody new who they were or why they did it they just thought we would assume they are in some form of cult. The characters were lame to be honest and weren't likable in the slightest. I didn't care why or how stuff was happening, I just new everything that was going to happen as I feel I've watched this movie 400 times, you go into a shop and there are at least 4 paranormal films a week that come out for £3 or more! its been done to much so if you are doing another it has to stand out! There were a few massive issues! firstly as you watch them in the car at the start of the movie they have there camera pointed at a guy on the bike, as they pass the camera scrolls to the wing mirror and the dudes disappeared! he was there and poof had gone, clearly poor editing.Next! the woman carved stuff into the floor and the man who worked a lot in that room building furniture at no point noticed! even though it was a room he did work in! secondly with this point is that she carved wood...so sawdust! I find it laughable that this stuff gets cleaned up whilst someone is in a demonic state! surely the sawdust would be there the next day? it wasn't! she is a very tidy demon..Last massive flaw! she ate 2 alive deer's! and showed super powers, that was the only time she did cool things and even then there was no follow up! surely someone would say on the news crazy woman eats dear or in the other scene at the market she opened and ate raw mince meat! but no! overlooked again.This film is terrible, i'm a fan of the genre but please god stop throwing hundreds of these films out and focus on making a few good ones.AVOID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"When a newly wed young couple accept an invitation to a club from a very suspicious looking taxi driver whilst on their honeymoon they fall prey to some unclear Satanic cult & she then becomes pregnant with the Devil's child. There's a lesson to be learned! This is basically a Rosemary's Baby clone but for the modern age. Filmed in the found footage style, a sub genre that has been frankly done to death, and although I felt that it wasn't entirely necessary for this movie they did at least do a reasonable job. Acting is good & there are a few decent special effects thrown in but on the downside it is fairly slow for most part, the shaky camera work does become annoying at times & plot wise it doesn't offer much.",0
"Children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming. While on their honeymoon Samantha (Miller) and Zach (Gilford) decide to go out clubbing and end up drinking more then planned and some of their trip is fuzzy. When they return home they are both surprised and excited when they find out Samantha is pregnant. What starts off as something happy begins to change when Samantha begins to act strangely. As I have said many times I try to watch as many movies as I can without seeing the previews first. I did that with this one and was very disappointed when I found out it was another found footage movie. That type of horror movie worked with the Blair Witch Project because it was new and everyone thought that it was real. To a lesser extent it also worked for the first Paranormal Activity because again at that time it was still new. Now that every other horror comes like this the ""realism"" is lost and just becomes more annoying then anything. Found footage aside there are many other problems with the movie. The first 20 minutes feels like someone forcing you to watch their bad home movies. It never really gets much more exciting then that. On a side note the movie Hell Baby which was a comedic version of this subject was much better then this one. Overall, yet another found footage horror movie that wasn't scary. It's almost time for this genre to stop. I give this a C.",0
"Why Why Why? Does this have a 3.9 rating lulz. Couple goes on honeymoon where the woman and the video camera is cursed by some Satanic cult, then calamity slowly ensues. But I'm not sure if she was already destined to give birth a demon child or whether she was cursed. She was born by being ripped out of her Mom's dying body in a car crash. So maybe she was supposed to die then and a demon took over her soul. Any way the movie doesn't take long to get going which is good. You are waiting in anticipation to see how it will end. I like the acting, the good part is that they play a couple well. She never wanted to have the baby in the first place and she gets angry that she is having it because she was on the pill. The parts where she breaks the car window and eats the raw meat in the grocery store are memorable. This isn't a bad movie at all.",0
"If you don't like ""found footage"" movies than this might not be for you but if you're okay with movies like Chronicle and Cloverfield then I think you'll really enjoy this movie. But it's more like a really sad love story than a crazy horror movie.It made me laugh a little at first and then it made me really tense and nervous. It was creepy the whole time. And I felt for the couple all the way through. They were great actors.Most people seem to write this off because it's ""found footage"" but the movie seems to flip that like Chronicle did and doesn't need the footage to have been found by anyone. I don't usually have a problem with ""found footage"" anyway and I respect the use of cameras in this because they always had cool ways to do it without explaining it to me over and over like I'm stupid, like they do in Chronicle. My friends I saw it with missed the hidden cameras getting installed and the lapel camera the husband wears and so they didn't like it but if you watch closely it's all pretty well explained.This isn't the best movie I've ever seen but it's a lot better than people say.",0
"Promoted as ROSEMARY'S BABY meets PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, this low-budget found footage movie was first caught the attention of famed director Eli Roth (HOSTEL, HOSTEL: PART II) at which he quoted on his official Twitter account: Don't pre-judge Devil's Due because Rosemary's Baby is a holy grail movie. It's so smart, creative, inventive, and fun. Very very scary. Upon finally watching it, I was like: Is he for real?WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?DEVIL'S DUE revolves around a newlywed young couple, Zach McCall (Zach Gilford) and Samantha McCall (Allison Miller) who both experience a mysterious lost night during their honeymoon vacation at Santo Domingo. Upon returning home, Samantha finds out that she is unexpectedly pregnant. Though shocked, the couple is happy with the result. Soon, as Zach starts to record everything with his video camera, he begins to notice a series of odd behaviors in his wife. As months goes by, it becomes obvious that there is something bad going on within Samantha's pregnancy.THE GOOD STUFFDEVIL'S DUE begins promisingly with a sneaky opening scene involving a ""stalker"" prowling at Samantha's house. It's nevertheless a good cinematic tease that both directing duo Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett (V/H/S) has displayed here. Apart from that, the two primary actors -- Zach Gilford and Allison Miller -- are worthwhile as well. However...THE BAD STUFF... Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett botches the would-be intriguing premise with their pedestrian direction. Aside from the middle scene involving Samantha and the three teenagers at the woods, most of the spooky parts are surprisingly low on scare. If that's not insulting enough, the so-called payoff at the finale is a huge disappointment -- all strangely anti-climactic and yet so unfulfilled that you might end up shouting in your mind: Seriously?Added to the disappointment is Lindsay Devlin's uninspired screenplay. It's nothing more than your typical found footage and supernatural horror combo that you've seen many times before.FINAL WORDSAll I can say that DEVIL'S DUE is a total rip-off from the immortal classic, ROSEMARY'S BABY. Save your hard-earned money, and wait for DVD release instead.http://www.caseymoviemania.blogspot.com",0
"DEVIL'S DUE is another 'devil baby' movie, albeit one with a slightly left-of-centre twist: this one's a found footage reworking of the same storyline as in ROSEMARY'S BABY. The familiarity of the material means that it's something of a bore to sit through.The film isn't strictly found footage in that the camera-work isn't supposedly taken from characters using video cameras and the like; instead, the ever-present camera shoots in a documentary style. The actors are to be commended for giving naturalistic performances, and there are some decent shock sequences, particularly one involving a local vicar.It's just a shame, then, that the film has such a jaded feel to it and the premise is so hackneyed. The shake-all-over-the-place climax is particularly nauseating, and not in a good way. DEVIL'S DUE has potential but in the end the indifferent execution makes it a bit of a joyless chore to sit through.",0
"A hybrid of a found footage and a documentary style reworking of Rosemary's Baby done on the cheap.Newlyweds Samantha (Allison Miller) and Zach McCall (Zach Gilford) honeymoon in the Dominican Republic. One evening they are taken to a weird bar by a cab driver. They get drunk to a point they do not remember what happened that night. Samantha is taken to a room where some kind of ritual is performed on her and when they arrive home, she is pregnant even though Samantha has been taking birth control pills.Zach notices his wife behaving oddly. She starts to eat raw meat even though she is a vegetarian. She can be aggressive, she can display great strength, she thinks there is something wrong with the baby. There are strangers watching the house who have rigged the house with hidden cameras. A priest ends up being hospitalised as he starts to suddenly cough up blood during a church service that the couple attend. The priest suspects that Samantha is due to give birth to the antichrist.The film has nothing new to offer when it comes to a possessed pregnancy or the found footage genre. It has all been recycled from other horror films. Apart from a few jolts it is absurd and not that scary. Even though it is less than 90 minutes long, it feels too long.",0
"Zach Gillford ... I just saw him in one of the best things that has been released this year! Midnight Mass ... seriously, if you haven't seen that Mini-Series on Netflix ... stop reading and go watch it! It's amazing and so good. Which are things that cannot be said about this movie ... at all.And to top the evil off (no pun intended) it is all done as ""found footage"". From various sources for some reason - but as nonsensical as the worst of them. The acting is ok for the type of movie this is ... the coincidences and convenient stuff that is as predictable as anything (to the point you could stop the movie and beat for beat tell what is going to happen next) ... if you are a fan of this thing or whatever I am supposed to call it, I reckon you may find something good in it ... I had a hard time - excuse the pun.",0
"Zach (Zach Gilford) and Samantha (Allison Miller) are newlyweds who annoyingly film everything and they don't do it well. On their honeymoon to the islands, she becomes pregnant with the anti-Christ which proves to be an annoyance to her vegan lifestyle.At one point when they weren't filming themselves, they used an overhead store camera to maintain the realism. It was really nice for a change to see something without a camera jerking about or a head being cut off. What was with the kid with a camera making a film in a dark hallway?Carrying the dark lord around in your tummy makes Holy Communion a little more exciting than usual. Apparently Satan cannot be born in a normal manner and has to come into the world making a lot of noise with kitchen utensils.The film picks up at about an hour. If you managed to make it that far you qualify for one punch on your hacker card, same as watching someone else's bad home movie about their little anti-Christ.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",0
I know how important is to me to watch what I have been recorded after visiting a fascinating place but this couple didn't watch the video from their honeymoon for 8 months?! If they did they would find out that something would went wrong.If they don't watch the recordings why the man carries a camera all the time?Every woman has a gynecologist who visit regularly. I think the woman in the movie sees a gynecologist for the first time in her life.For me this weak scenario would be better if the couple found earlier the mystery and start investigation the situation.,0
"I heard a bit about this scary movie, I assumed it was going to be a standard film, possibly the new Rosemary's Baby or something, it wasn't what I expected once I started it, and I saw low ratings by critics, but I stuck with it and watched. Basically, filmed on many hand-held cameras, young couple Zach (Zach Gilford) and Samantha 'Sam' McCall (Allison Miller) have got married and are going on honeymoon to the Dominican Republic, while there they visit fortune teller who repeats to Sam, ""they've been waiting for you"". Later that night they get lost trying to find their way back to their hotel, they are picked up by a pushy cab driver (Roger Payano) who offers to take them to a local bar, they reluctantly accept, there they party and both pass out drunk, they appear to be taken to an underground chamber where Sam is subject to some kind of cult ritual by an unseen force. The next morning Zach and Sam wake with no memory of the night before, returning home from the honeymoon Sam discovers she is pregnant, despite having taken birth control pills since the wedding day, they are shocked, but overjoyed, telling friends and family, and after their first ultrasound scan they are told the healthy looking baby is due by the end of March. Through the course of the pregnancy though strange things are happening, with Sam having constant nosebleeds, bruising on her stomach, cravings for raw meat despite being a vegetarian, super- strength and telekinetic abilities and unexplained feelings of rage when she or the baby are threatened, also odd-looking people have been randomly watching their house. Zach is convinced something is wrong with the baby, they are seen by a new doctor at the second scan, he may be from the cult who have placed tiny camera in the McCall's home to monitor her progress and make sure she does not hurt the baby that she has become uncomfortable having. Eight months pass, attending holy communion the couple and all people in the church are shocked to see priest Father Thomas (Forrest Gump's Sam Anderson) violently coughing blood during the service, later Zach reviews footage he filmed, he recognises the taxi driver and sees a strange symbol, the priest in hospital recognises the symbol as relating to the summoning of the Antichrist, and investigating a thought to be abandoned house at the end of the street Zach finds the CCTV footage of inside his house, he barely manages to escape before the cult return and perform a ritual. Returning home Zach hears Sam scream and all house glass smashes, he finds her in a trance-like state with a knife to her chest, there is a blast of light, he recovers and finds her lying in her own blood with a cut to the stomach, she cries and wonders if the baby is alright before dying, Zach breaks down grieving and then the taxi driver and second doctor appear, they take the baby regardless of his pleas, Zach is arrested and interrogated by police about his wife's death and the baby's disappearance, we do not find out his fate, but another couple on honeymoon in Paris are lured into a taxi by the same driver. Also starring Robert Belushi as Mason, Catherine Kresge as Tina, Aimee Carrero as Emily, Sloane Coe as Ashley, Tyler Forrest as Steve, Stacie Davis as Karen and Yohance Myles as Jim. I didn't realise before watching this film that it was a ""found footage"" setup, so I expected similarities to The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity, the first half of the film start well and you sort of get into it, but I eventually got tired of the plot, I agree there are the odd jumpy and creepy moments, as an overall film I was a little disappointed, but its not the most terrible horror film. Okay!",0
There is a quote from Heart of Darkness at the start. There are these kids who performed a ritual and unleashed something. Their presence at the bar caused the fight and opened a wound. The wound is a portal to another world. This is outlined in the book The Translation of Wounds II. When people look at the phone they see pictures of things the kids did and it sparks an interest or attachment in the viewer to this released entity. It comes from a tunnel. It tweaks an interest and suggests something about oneself as per the quote from Heart of Darkness. He's a shell of a man filling the void with drinking. The cockroaches are the amount of entity present. Hence at the end they're everywhere and the thing comes out of the wound portal to enter him and fill his void.,0
"At the end I found myself wondering if I'd blinked and missed a vital plot point because nothing was explained (and not in a ""ooh ambiguous and intelligent"" way).Good performances from all involved but as a massive fan of Under The Shadow, I found myself very disappointed.",0
"I thought with this cast, this would be a great horror movie. Instead it's a literally wound to your life and time.The storyline is so jumbled and a mess, not even Armie can save it. We honestly have no clue about the plot except there was some kind of ritual.There was no explanation of why Rick was the portal for whatever came out of him at the end; we could barely see it because of the stupid CGI cockroaches covering the screen at the end.No explanation why Armie's character was chose and no reason why Carrie was the only one affected by the internet tunnel of hell..I suppose?And finally, what was the purpose of the college kids? To drop the phone and send messages with ZERO context?When you do realize that the ritual was performed based on some books, you are never told what happened and why it happened.This movie is garbage.",0
"I couldn't spoil the plot, even if i wanted to. Because i don't know what the movie is about.The beginning was kinda good.A bar, only a few frequent guests, a bar fight and a guy (maybe a friend of the protagonist or just a regular guest idk) is getting stabbed in the face. They find the ""evil"" phone (as the movie trailer hinted). I thought the evilness of the phone caused the fight and the spooky spooky first ""Wound""But then it turned into some relationship drama with roaches. He is in a relationship, his ex-girlfriend too. He wants her back, she doesn't want him back. He casually breaks up with his girlfriend sitting at the table having breakfast. The morning after she gazed into a hole thingy on her laptop looking like a corpse and peed on a chair. A couple of roaches later he eats/inhales/absorbs the moldy facial wound from the guy who got stabbed. The end.I still don't know what's with the evil phone or the hole thingy and the roaches. I only know why the movie is called ""Wounds"" because it's so stupid you will get brain damage. The acting is sometimes good, dialogues are bad, and it's not scary. Maybe for people who don't like roaches. It's not body horror, it's not mind-bending, there is no ghost/demon/supernatural entity, no reality - dream confusion. Who reads that and says ""Let's make a movie"" Obviously it wasn't someone who watched a horror movie before.The only scary thing was, that he sat on the pee chair then he sat on the couch, the next morning he wears the same pee-pants, he breaks up with his girlfriend and wanders off to the bar still in pee-pants.After reading the short story, everything became so clear. 🤣 Apparently he is such a depraved person he drinks, cheats, gets angry and works as a bartender. That he needs and eventually wants to be saved by the cockroach-angels which use decapitated and then peeled heads or wounds in general as a portal and can communicate via cell phone.I am not a fan of the story either, the descriptions are too much sometimes borderline pretentious. blood-spattered like a psychedelic Vulcano caught in mid-explosion, a berserker canary in a sky full of hawks, stabbed guy makes a high pitched noise that seemed to signal a transition into another state of being that seemed to carve this moment from the rational world and torn it separate. All this and Will booted up his video game console not an Xbox or PS. And the roaches are a swarm of christ bound spirits.",0
Had no clue what was going on throughout the whole film and the characters were so boring. The only reason I watched until the end was in hopes of finding out what it was all about- but nope didnt happen.,0
"My expectations for this film was very high because of the cast and that Babak Anvari's last film, ""Under The Shadow"" was exceptional to say the very least.Wounds starts like a mysterious and disturbing horror film something to do with a Will (Armie Hammer) a bartender discovering a smartphone and cockroaches. He lives a normal life with his girlfriend Carrie (Dakota Johnson) and things starts to change after he witnesses a huge fight in his bar. It's first 30 minutes is very promising but once we start going to the second act it starts to fall apart and the film relies more on ""holy s**t"" movements rather than a convincing plot.The film ends ambiguously and doesn't really give us an idea about Babak wanted to explore. Aside from Armie's brilliant performance there isn't a lot to take from Wounds. A run of the mill decent yet wasted potential horror film.",0
"I love Armie Hammer, and you have to hand it to him he gives a terrific, sincere and energetic performance, he is a cut above in this film.The film itself, did they stop making it half way? I really enjoyed the first half, it had some great ideas, and some wonderfully dark scenes, but what on Earth was that ending all about, the titles rolled and all I could think, was are they having a laugh?An ambiguous ending can work, if done well, but this was clumsy, and felt lazy, I don't always want a resolution in a film, but don't build the action, go for the shock, then pull it.It's such a shame, I really enjoyed what I saw, but it's half baked, make your mind up. 6/10",0
"I don't even know why this is classified as horror. It's basically just a long drawn out drama about a loser guy who wants to cheat on his girlfriend with a few ""creepy"" moments thrown in out of nowhere, that seem to lead nowhere and mean nothing. The end was dumb and just made me say ""seriously?????""",0
"This movie was all over the place. They never explained anything. None of the relationships between the chartoonlike characters mattered in any way. It dragged on, trying to give you a little background as to what was going on and why, but only scraps. Then nothing. The ending was a pathetic joke. Then it was just over. No answers, no nothing. I'm quite literally angry that this movie wasted my time and I stayed to the end, just to see there really wasn't one. Is as if the writer had an idea, then 1/2 way through, forgot what it was, and just filled in the rest of the movie with nonsense dialog and actions.",0
"Wounds turned out to be the kind of horror that's right up my isle, unsettling, moody, even gnarly & with occult themes involved. Despite its one major flaw which got everyone throwing around the well below average ratings, I'm here to defend it.""Wounds"" can be best described as a mood piece, it's a slow burning drama for the most part and the aforementioned flaw is that there are no fireworks at the end of it - We'll return to that later. I was already satisfied with the movie in the first 10 minutes, many qualities like great acting, good dialogue, effective atmosphere & pleasant cinematography manifested themselves and stayed till the end. I'm not going to spoil the story, I think it's for the best you know no more than what the synopsis and trailer shows you. To describe it a little, the story is quite narrow, mostly revolves around Armie Hammers character and his, I'd like to say, descended into madness. I have a huge love for occult themes in horror movies & rarely anything like that comes along, the last I remember was a horror indie ""Pyewacket"". ""Wounds"" strong suit is definitely the legitimately creepy atmosphere, supported by solid performances, top tier sound design & well done fx, some of it practical. Visually I can't pick on it at all. I enjoyed the fact that a lot of the creepiness factor was in the clashes between characters, just in the conversations, tension and the impending doom can be felt, if you let it. Then comes the ending which, yes, felt underwhelming, but I can't disregard the whole movie because of it & that's why I didn't give it more than a 7. I would've. A lot of movies that I can call mood pieces - a lot of them have little to no substance, they sacrifice plot for the sake of atmosphere building. Personally, atmosphere is one the most important parts in movies for me & sure, if it also has substance, even better.""Wounds"" is a flawed movie with an objectively highly underwhelming and cut-off ending, but before that there are 90 minutes filled with dark atmosphere, dread and quality filmmaking in almost all its aspects. I enjoyed it a lot. My rating: 7/10.",0
"I'm not one to bash movies, but wtf? Absolutely no story! good actors but they should be ashamed for even taking the part. It would have been more enjoyable watching paint dry. Honesty who would make a movie with absolutely no story or substance is beyond me. I'm all for leaving things open for interpretation but come on. The only thing I got from this was evil cockroaches taking over the world? The elusive college kids that never show up? Text messages you have to pause to read for any glimmer of hope for context. Waste of money waste of time. First 1 Star I ever given and that is too much.",0
"I am a big fan of Babak's previous film 'Under the Shadow', which was a perfect summation of what a great supernatural film can be, with investment in the characters, overall story arc and satisfying, yet open-ended ending. So, when attending Sundance Film Festival 2019 and saw his next film 'Wounds' on the list, naturally I jumped at the chance to see it.This movie had the right mix of tension built up between the characters from the very first scene and delivered an astoundingly eerie and ominous presence throughout the film as weird events transpired. Armie Hammer's performance and reaction to everything occurring to him throughout the sequence of strange events in the film was absolutely phenomenal and really captivated my attention. However, where this film fell flat was in the story arc and ending. By the ending, you realize that nothing was explained throughout the film and you can't help but have a ton of questions only to be left without any answers. What did the original owners of the phone do that caused the chaos that spiraled out of control in the entire film? Was Armie Hammer's character possessed? If so, by what and how? What was the image that his girlfriend was compelled to stare at for hours on end on her computer screen? This left me as the viewer feeling short changed and upset at what could have been a phenomenal film.I know that this film was based on a book called The Visible Filth that I have not yet read, but hopefully there might be answers to some of these questions in there that the movie did not provide.Overall, this film had massive potential that was utterly wasted with an unsatisfying and in-conclusive ending. I am hoping this is just part 1 with a 2nd movie to be released that can provide some guidance into the confusion that I just watched.",0
I have provided a more accurate title for this terrible film.,0
"I've zero idea what people who're bashing Hammer for his performance are thinking because his performance was the only note worthy thing about this. The writing is abysmally disappointing to say the least. It feels like they tried to do a lot of things, but couldn't pull of even one of them. Besides the creepy bugs and Hammer's character's descent into madness it was an unremarkable, uninteresting, forgettable movie that one could do without watching. Skip this one if you have other movies in your watchlist.",0
"Starts off ok, there's a bar fight, the bartender picks up a phone left behind. From then on, what is going on??? Anytime you think it'll start making it sense, it just gets worse. Added to that, it doesn't help that the characters are as dull as watching paint dry. Even the cockroaches had more credibility. Avoid.",0
"Lot of bad reviews but I like Wounds - it is for certain not your typical mainstream teenie horror movie but rather a bad trip that is taking some hard looks into the Abyss. Wounds is also no feel-good movie, as the movie/story got really a bad, ugly but growing intense dark and sometimes even depressing tone - somewhat a weird and psychotic mixture of movies like Barfly (Mickey Rourke, 1987) and Bug (Ashley Judd, Michael Shannon, 2006) with some dips into horror and here and there a little sip of gore. Like a good (or bad) trip the story doesn't gives us any explanations what's going on and after the final curtain is closed the audience is left with a lot of questions and not many answers. Recommended: if you know how to enjoy trippy and rather experimental stuff. Last but not least, the acting is really good.",0
"I've seen every horror movie and am an avid collector and fan with hopes to join the club one day. I've seen it all from highly anticipated big budget films to the cheapest looking indie films you can find with a special interest in found footage. To me, the scariest type of film is the type that leaves much to the viewers imagination and is somewhat open to interpretation. Nothing is scarier than what we can cook up in our minds. Other movies in a similar vein are ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""V/H/S 1 AND 2"" and even ""Southbound"" all these films have incredibly dark tones and seriously creepy nuances. This brings me to ""Wounds""; one of the most mysterious and darkly atmospheric horror films to come around in some time. Armie Hammer plays Will, a bartender working in a scruff type area and who lives with his younger girlfriend. He is a handsome man but he is also a very needy and possessive man as he begs for the affection of a close friend of his that will never see him as anything more than just a friend, if that. The film revolves around a plot involving a violent incident that takes place in the bar during the opening scene and a cell phone that is left behind that night by a group of mysterious underage teenagers. Will takes the phone home that night and so begins one of the most deeply unnerving horror films ever made with a potent break up story running through out. Anvari uses his minimalistic approach here again to create something truly sinister oozing with dread. This movie is unpredictable and as a whole it will leave u scratching ur head. Maybe checking for roaches or maybe just in confusion. The confusion gives way to creative implements on what we just witnessed.",0
"Alternate title: ""The Man Who Refused To Step On Cockroaches"".I don't know if there is a person on this planet (except for the handful of freaks to hold these awful insects as pets) who'd never step on a cockroach, even if he were surrounded and plagued by them day-in day-out. But this unexpected cockroach-tolerance - displayed by the protagonist - is the least of the movie's problems.The first half-hour is fairly intriguing. Not much wasted screen-time on small-talk i.e. the usual boring introductory nonsense you get in 95% of horror films when little happens and characters utter mundane, meaningless (and unfunny) lines to each other. An unusual set-up too; it is unclear where the movie is heading with all this, and that's usually a good thing. (Turns out it was heading nowhere.)Unfortunately, things start getting a little bit stupid after that. Firstly, the bartender (who looks vaguely like Greg Kinnear) doesn't go to the cops. Considering that he has good friends who are cops and who work nearby, this is fairly illogical. (Even his girlfriend later admonishes him for being reluctant about informing cops.) Nor is he in a rush to inform the phone's owner - one of his own customers - that the phone is in his possession. Then we have that silly, exaggerated scene in which he throws himself out of his car - and within seconds ten people are standing around him, filming him with mobile phones! Is this a comedy then? It wasn't until then.Later that day the barkeep goes back to work, more-or-less as if not much had happened. The fact that he saw photos of severed heads? That he was told by anonymous people he ""was chosen"" for sacrifice? The fact that after this warning he had a vivid hallucination that made him throw out the phone and almost smash into a car - while thinking he was being attacked by cockroaches? He is way too chill. (His girl tells him later on that he is ""too blasé"" about all this, but we never find out why hence her comment is irrelevant.) Any person would have been freaking out, for days, if not weeks, months. But that's the problem with so many movies; they are not focused on keeping things even half-way realistic. This is doubly stupid, because this movie plays out as a half-drama, not as some generic formulaic teen horror - in which such idiotic characterization errors/inconsistencies are not only common but expected.The barkeep is shown to be cunning (for example the way he figures out the password on the mysterious phone), and yet when the cops ask him for the license plate number of the car that's been following him, he stupidly responds with: ""it begins with six"", and without a trace of joking. The cops laugh, while the audience does a collective face-palm. So is he dumb or not? Well, he snorts cocaine, so it's probably the former.Nevertheless, despite these minor irritations, by the time I reached the one-hour mark I was still wondering why the movie has such a low rating for a non-B-movie production. A 4.0 is fairly low for a horror film with a decent budget. (Especially since budget movies get automatically swarm-voted and fake-reviewed, more so than low-budget stinkers.) There was no obvious badness there. Not yet. This would change.In the second hour, the movie still had plenty of mystery on its side, things were still interesting. And fairly dumb too. Despite witnessing so many weird things the night he dropped his girlfriend into the bathtub, things that would utterly freak out ANYBODY, he still had the motivation to call up his ex to find out why she told her new boyfriend about their little stint together. That'd be like being in a burning airplane, falling down rapidly while everyone around you was screaming - then deciding to phone up your girlfriend to ask her who won the Cup finale. Quite absurd. Relationship issues should be the last thing on anyone's mind while hell-demons from other dimensions are threatening to crush all of their teeth and lop off their head. It's called ""emergency prioritizing"". (Or at least that's how I decided to name it.)Even sillier, the next morning instead of discussing Satan's hell-beasts and how to defend themselves from them, he calmly proposes to his girlfriend that they break up! I.e. yet more relationship nonsense, which is extremely irrelevant given their situation. It's as if this movie is desperately trying to play a romantic drama CONCURRENTLY with a hell-beast demon possession horror. Not doable. And why make that kind of movie anyway? That same day he pesters his ex, yet again, wanting to discuss relationship stuff. Did these demons possess him to become a yenta or to use his (empty) head as a vessel to enter the human realm in a weird cockroach-infested ritual? Which is it? It can't be both. Nora Roberts never had a supernatural satanic sub-plot. (Just guessing here, obviously.)It's a pity that the film is so seriously hampered by these relationship scenes and the overall genre schizophrenia. I'd have cut them out, turn this into a proper horror film.But wait, no. I'd still have an incomplete movie, because of those idiotic, confusing last few scenes which not only explain ZERO about what's been going on but muddle things even more. The utterly nonsensical dialog between the bartender and the Confederate thug is a scene that redefines ""worthless"".This is Wikipedia's explanation: ""Will (barkeep) realizes the higher being the kids summoned is inside Eric's wound. After calling Garrett again, which fills the room with the inhuman screeching, a swarm of cockroaches arrive. Will finally submits and starts to absorb the higher being in an attempt to become whole as cockroaches envelop the house."" This summary is rubbish, and even if it weren't this ""explanation"" resolves nothing. Becoming whole? We knew he was an A-whole, but we never knew he was supposed to be whole, whatever that means.What's with that Confederate flag crap, anyway? When will American movies finally stop insulting us with their cheap, filthy propaganda nonsense? The more they tell me to hate the Confederate flag the more I am liable to sympathize with its fans; they are just achieving the opposite with this kind of preaching, at least in my case.Two points off for the silly ending that serves no purpose, except to tell us that the writer/director isn't competent enough to deliver a script without outside help. The movie is based on a novel; that book is either rubbish or has been butchered by a lame adaptation. Why do these millennial/Xer directors have to write as well as direct? This is just one of many reasons why (American) cinema has deteriorated so rapidly this century, this megalomania and exaggerated self-belief among so many writers and directors that they can do everything themselves. Becoming a respected ""auteur"" these days is a big hipster ambition, but only very few are capable of pulling it off with success. And I mean QUALITY success, not financial success.",0
"People rating this move 1 have no idea of what's going on. Very well acted, filmed and the sound effects are particularly good across the whole movie. In my perspective this movie is about a man's ruin due to alcohol abuse. His conduct is questionable, his life empty, his loved ones suffer. To the point that the only way for him to be to be ""whole"" is found at the end of a tunnel/bottom of a bottle. Excellent allegory and great movie.",0
I wonder if the actors read the script before signing up to do this movie? The dialogue was terrible and had me cringing with embarrassment listening to them trying to belt out their ridiculous lines.I'd give this one a miss.,0
"I'm sorry but the people rating this movie a 1/10 should not be rating movies. First off this movie had atmosphere like crazy. The production alone should put this movie at a 5/10 and another few points for the acting, which is top notch. Where it missed was not having an acceptable ending which i find is happening more and more. Especially when it's hard to bring the story together they just stop the movie. I don't want to choose my own ending and try and figure out what happened. They had the piece ther for it to be great and they hinted at there being a reason for this by the small snippets of computer scenes. Why not dive deeper into that as a means of following through the story to the end.",0
It has intersting start but how it goes further it falls more and more,0
"Slow burner with a lot left unexplained.. Descent into alcoholism, madness or some weird variation of gnosticism (maybe a little unfair on gnostic) good performance from himself and variable from the rest (sorry can't stick Dakota Johnson personally) Builds to a bizarre ending. Sort of a strange mixture of horror and indy naturalism. I like it..",0
"And I think the movie was really enjoyable. The acting is really good, specially concerning the main character. I graded it 7 because I felt all the aprehension and curiosity I ask for as a thriller/horror movie fan. However, I agree that the movie doesn't explain much of what is going, which is a huge flaw. It could have turned out to be a great horror movie, but I liked the attempt.",0
"This movie fine. Could've it been done better? Sure. Does retribution matter to alot of viewers? Seems so. One of the movies I never liked was ""Drag Me To Hell"". I'm not a big fan of horrors that subvert expectations but serving the viewer no retribution for the antagonist can be frustrating. It's a style of movie I'm not a fan of, however this movie is somewhere in the middle. Well acted, crazy plot and frustrating dialog. But did I enjoy it? Yes, I had no idea where it was heading. It doesn't seem to be set up to subvert expectations. It has a start and an ending, it is what it is and that execution, while not perfect, was just fine. I watched this the other night before it was rated here, I come back and it's a 4.4/10. Really? It's a freaky movie, it is what it is. But a 4.4? People that hate things are more likely to review something, just to give a bad rating. The rest of us? We enjoy a movie and then go on about our day. This is where ""authenticated"" critics are suppose to step in with some balance, but they hate everything too now, or give great reviews because it ticks some irrelevant ""inclusion & diversity"" check list. What a mess! Watch this movie, it's fun. 7/10 for the genre and what it set out to do. Screw with your head. Take it easy.",0
"Universal Soldier: The Return (1999) in my opinion is the most underrated, bashed, hated solid sequel flick that I absolutely Love and one of my favorite movies in the franchise! After the success of the first film Universal Soldier (1992) directed from Roland Emmerich, there were two TV movies directed who were suppose to be a mini series and they were all canceled. Universal Soldier II: Brothers in Arms (1998) and Universal Soldier III: Unfinished Business (1999) Starring Matt Battaglia as Luc Devereaux / GR44 and Chandra West as Veronica Roberts. Jean-Claude Van Damme had a strict policy not to make any sequels, but after 7.years later, he decide to make the sequel to the Universal Soldier, which he did make this film and it was his last movie released in the movie theater until JCVD (2008). I know this movie has flaws, because Luc Devereaux (Van Damme) is human and he his a daughter. Universal Soldiers can't have a children wow. That it was a bad acting and so on. I disagree with all of the haters, Regeneration and Day of Reckoning are even worst than The Return. Because they ruined the beloved character Luc Deveraux. I like Regeneration but not so much as I love The Return. I hate Day of Reckoning, I am thinking, it is the worst film in the franchise for Van Damme, only him been in a 7 mins. in the film, that was lame. I don't know why so many people hate this movie with critics & box office failure? In my opinion this movie is one of my all time favorites and it deserved to be one of the best Van Damme movies ever. I've always had fun with this one. Very fast paced, lots of action, cool fights, good soundtrack, and Van Damme acting with a smile on his face. I don't think this movie is bad, I love the original move to death and I love this one too. In here you have Van Damme acting with his smile on his face and he does care and has a heart in it. I like the new generation of Unisols, I thought they were pretty good, the fights were weary fast paced. This movie had a Personality and kept you entertained all the time. This one has Michael Jai White in it, he did a solid perfect acting performance as S.E.T.H. He was the soldier in the opening scene in Universal Soldier, I am happy he returned to the sequel with a different character playing in here. This one has Bill Goldberg in it as another UniSol soldier, who becomes enemy of Luc Deveraux. This movie isn't the greatest flick ever made, nor is it as good as Universal Solider for me. But it is still a fun flick regardless, and much better than the horrible direct to video sequels, and it is without a doubt ten times better than the awful sequels that came before it that aired on Showtime starring Matt Bataglia who can't even act let alone fight. This film has a bad ass soundtrack, some bad ass fights, and it is a fast paced fun movie that was a lot of fun to watch. I like my Universal Soldier films to have Van Damme kicking ass, and smiling at the same time. Not falling asleep while watching stupid monkeys or acting like Col. Kurtz. This flick offers that kind of high-intensity sci-fi action you've come to expect from Van Damme in a story you won't soon forget. There are much worse Van Damme flicks than Universal Soldier: The Return and much worse action movies as well. Hell half the action films released in the past few years can't even hold this movie's jock. Abduction with Taylor Lautner from Twilight gets a 5.0 and there is no way in hell that is a better action movie than this. I would much rather watch this fun, fast paced sequel than Terminator: Genisys or any reboot movie of the week. If anything, this is underrated and not worth the overwhelming amount of pure crap the film has gotten over the years. It isn't a Shakespeare folks. Hell, the first film wasn't either. It was just as silly at points and as over the top as this was. Day Of Reckoning makes this film's tone and style look like Mary Poppins and that gets a higher rating and more praise from people. I wish more movies were like this one today, especially from Van Damme. Honestly in my opinion I do care a lot about Van Damme he is my idol and I am very happy he did made a sequel to the original movie. The rating I am giving to this underrated hateful sequel is a 7, I am probably the only one who likes this movie.",0
"This is a shocking 'B' grade action movie with lots of bad acting and dialogue. Van Damme does his usual best which aint much, Jai White is good as Seth but the scene stealer is the cheesy but lovable Bill Goldberg. This film is so ridiculously bad that it ends up being funny and quite enjoyable.If you like cheesy low budget action flicks that doesn't take itself too seriously then this is worth a laugh or two! As a fan of the genre and the fact that i realise this isn't meant to be taken seriously, *** out of *****!",0
"Regular follow-up in which Luc Deveraux and other ""universal soldiers"" must fight the whole army when then the military's supercomputer S.E.T.H gets out of control , as soldiers have been secretly reanimated , upgraded and leading a riot , threatening to unleash a world rebellion .

Jean-Claude Van Damme and Billy Goldberg also have several action set-pieces together at some bloody confrontations .

"The mind boggles at exactly what about Universal Soldier merited a sequel. Since the real star, Dolph Lundgren, would not be able to reprise his role from the original, there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax write-off. Bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler Bill Goldberg and martial arts expert Michael Jai White. To their credit, they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement. Bill Goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film, and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role. For once, his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times, and it does not get irritating. The problem from the audience's point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes Lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films. And therein lies the problem. You do not go to see a Van Damme film because you want serious action. You go because you want comedy, however unintentional.Unbeknownst to many people, Universal Soldier was followed by two direct-to-video sequels. I have only seen the first, which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke. Matt Battaglia was so terrible in the role of Luc Deveraux that for once in his career, the sight of Jean-Claude Van Damme comes as a welcome relief. The film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned direct-to-video sequels, and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original. After years of investigation and explanation, the Unisol project is still going ahead, with some minor modifications. For one, the new Unisols are stronger and more damage-resistant than their earlier cousins. For another, all of the Unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called SETH. In the early parts of the film, SETH exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass dome.Being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes, we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut. The Unisol project is on the chopping block, which essentially means that SETH will be turned off. SETH, somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained, decides to mobilise the Unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down. His only problem is that every so often, a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown. Two individuals possess the code in question. SETH kills the first in short order, and those who are familiar with the plot kit that Van Damme's films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be. The rest of the film revolves around the Unisols' attempts to get the code out of Van Damme without injuring him too badly. A subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film, but it adds about as much to the story as Van Damme does to the profession of acting.The film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clichés. When SETH transplants his command module into the body of Michael Jai White, we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over. He goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanity's weakness(es). Gee, SETH, you mean they will not be our strong points? All kidding aside, the short length of the film is both the film's weakness and its strength. It leaves the action without adequate setup. In the original, we are given a very thorough explanation of the Unisols, how they work, and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film. Here, the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a Unisol is and how they operate. At least in the original, a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice. Here, one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform (and presumably his body), getting up every time without stopping for breath.I tend to reserve the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner. If you can see it on the cheap, knock yourself out. This is the kind of film that makes me mourn the loss of Mystery Science Theatre.",0
"Wow what pure garbage! Well At least I knew it was going be bad before I saw it. I mean first of all it's a Jean Claude Van Damme movie. Secondly, without Dolph Lundgren the first one would have been a bore. I guess you can sum this one up by saying that it was so bad that it was funny. Yes, this movie was hilarious. It made absolutely no sense, had no plot, just a bunch of stuff that happens and a bunch of people get blown up. For example this girl in the movie whom Luc just met like 3 hours ago at the most is telling him at the end of the movie that she can't live without him. PLEASE!!! I have never watched more predictable movie.",0
"Van Damme returns to one of his best action roles, with a very weak storyline, and very irritating, stereo-typed characters.When the action is going, IT'S GOING. Van Damme's aging, but, still has the moves. He's also a widower with a young daughter.First plot problem, his daughter has access to the ""Top Secret Project"" building for the Universal Soldier program, and uses it like a daycare center. No other workers had their kids there, so what made her so special, except to put her closer to the action.Second plot problem, the female reporter. She arrives for and interview, is excorted inside the factility, and when all hell breaks loose, she and her cameraman remain instead of being escorted out. Another excuss to put a character close to the danger.Third plot problem, the irritating and unreal attitude the reporter has. Instead of showing the least amount of fear over the killing and mayhem going on around her, she's doing her ""I-a-reporter-with-a-scoop"" dialogue. I was hoping that Romeo or another soldier would take her out.Fourth plot problem, Kiana Tom, Van Damme's butt-kicking sidekick at the beginning of the movie, is left on the sidelines for most of the movie. Her character replacing the reporter would have enhanced the whole story and added to the action.If you can overlook the plot problems, the show is at least bearable.",0
"I must say when I first saw this movie I'd only seen bits of the first one and hadn't seen the 2nd or 3rd which are made for TV, so didn't really get the overall plot although I knew this one basically follows on from the 1st as it features Van Damme whilst the 2nd and 3rd don't, so I thought thats good enough for me.Anyway, I sat down and watched it and must say I was very, very impressed. Even though it barely lasts, (it goes on for just over an hour), I must say some of the action in this movie is truly spectacular and right up there with some of the best i've ever seen, and believe me I've seen a hell of a lot of action movies even though i'm only 16. In this movie there are some brilliant fights, gun fights, explosions (especially the one at the very end) and chases.Also Bill Goldberg is brilliant in his movie debut as the main Unisol, and Van-Damme (although slightly beginning to fade) is still preety much on top throughout. Heidi Schanz is also likable as his unlikely sidekick. I even chuckled at one or two rare comedy scenes in the movie. The plot is a bit weird and virtually the whole movie takes place over the space of one night, but if you want to watch a movie and be entertained or your a die-hard action fan, then this is the one for you. I found out on here that this movie was in the bottom 100 on IMDb, which is very unfair because as far as i'm concerned because there isun't a huge amount wrong with this movie and I've seen way worst movies than this. Actually, this isun't a bad movie at all.So I'm going to give this movie and 8 out of 10 because I was never bored, thoroughly entertained and it had some truly spectacular action scenes. My only complaint would be it being a little too short and a slightly better background on Van-Damme's character.",0
"This movie is just so bad it's good! The acting may look a bit ""forced"" at times (ok, perhaps ""painfully horrible"" would be a better expression) but really folks... did you honestly expect an award winning performance from Van Damme or Goldberg? I don't know about you all, but I rented this movie to see Van Damme trade punches with the 290 pound Goldberg and Michael Jai White while uttering dozens of slightly pathetic/slightly amusing one liners at every conceivable opportunity, and I got just what I asked for =)If you don't like it... tough.Go rent ""The Piano"" or ""Lawn Dogs"" if you want real movies, but if you just want Van Damme brawling with big guys plus some shots of pretty girls, this is just what the doctor ordered.One of my favourites.",0
"Right away Van Damme knows what this movie is; not too serious and an easy cash grab. This time Van Damme is helping to oversee a project involving a new batch of universal soldiers run by the government which is now being shut down. One new twist is that there is an intelligent computer system managing some part of the soldier's mental activity. Very reminiscent of Hal from ""2001"" as right away it seems, you know, overly savvy and smarmy. Mix in a pushy reporter, just like in the original, some explosives, a strip club brawl and loads of hand to hand combat and that's the movie. It borrowed many concepts from Terminator 2. Terrible dialog, even the one-liners were poorly written and there was zero tension, something the first one had along with some genuinely amusing scenes.",0
"This movie wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. I'll say it's one of Van Damme's best films in years cause he hasn't done a good film in years. I won't call this a sequel either cause it had almost nothing to do with the first one, so u didn't have to see the first one to understand this one. This was just a basic action shot em up flick, very violent, a lot more action in this one than the first one, but US 1 seemed a little more interesting than this one. Goldberg was ok in this movie much better than I expected though, and Michael Jai White was actually very good, man he can fight, good moves. Luckily though I didn't waste my money on this movie cause me and my friend had passes so we got in free. Overall this movie was good to go see if u are a die hard Van Damme fan or Universal Soldier fan, however the ending stank, it was the worst part of the movie, other than that, it wasn't a bad flick.",0
"There are really only 3 reasons to watch this: Michael Jai White has some quality screen time; Kiana Tom is quite gorgeous except for her dismal second incarnation, and this film has the most hilariously gratuitous T & A sequence since Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder hid out in the poledancing club in Stir Crazy.Actually I quite like Van Damme - he makes martial arts look attainable. You can go to your classes and think ""I'll never be as good as Jet Li, the guy's superhuman. But I might just get as good as Van Damme someday.""",0
"I really don't get why most people heavily criticize this movie. Actually, I had a really fun time watching this flick. Maybe the reason why so many people dislike it is because they just take it too seriously. Fans of the first movie who expect a serious sequel won't get what they're hoping for. That's rather good in my opinion. The first movie was just boring and had bad (and too little) action, but that's not the case with ""Universal Soldier: The Return"". The action is nearly non-stop from beginning to end, and most of the action scenes are great! I really liked that wrestling guy being one of the main bad guys, and the fight at the hospital with the nurses (you have to see it for yourself) was just hilarious. The story was OK too, and Michael Jai White was perfect as the villain in this movie.",0
"This film completely ruins the storyline, Van Damme character is now somehow completely human, his girlfriend is killed off. What a start! That's completely not cannon for me after the first film. On the other hand the action is so great, lots of destruction and practical effects, the fight scenes are great. But they messed up the ending bad too, it just felt like they wanted to make another 20 minutes, but they there out of budget so they did the ending you see.Overall if you ignore it's a sequel, you can have a lot of fun with this movie.",0
"Jean-Claude Van Damme has been in about a film a year for 15 years now, and has been the star performer in those films since 1985's No Retreat, No Surrender.",0
"I like Van Dammes movies and Universal soldier was one of my favorites(along with Blood sport and Hard target). I looked forward to a sequel, but when I saw the reviews, ""The worst film I've seen"" it also earned it self a average of 3.0(29th of Feb 2000) on this sight. But I had to hire it out, and I was honestly surprised. DON'T watch it unless youv'e seen the first or it will make no sense. It doesn't explain the first story, it only says that Luc(Van Damme) was one of the first uni sols. It then doesn't tell you about the new project, and how Luc became involved, also it says about the main female characture in the first, who is now his wife and is dead, how did she die? Although it doesn't make much sense it is a good action film with some great fight scenes especially ones with Goldburg, and the final showdown. So make your own decision and watch. entertaining 4/10",0
"This is, by far, the worst Van Damme movie I have ever seen ! The scenes are predictable, and there is only action, action, action, a little nude, action, action. It's a blood show ! Machine guns show ! The plot is miserable. Some little modifications on the first Universal Soldier movie, and we have The Return. Don't watch it !",0
UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: THE RETURN / (1999) 1/2* (out of four)By Blake French:,0
"Jean Claude Van Damme returned to the franchise (which had made-for-video sequels already) with this average sequel co-starring Bill Goldberg (not exactly a thespian) as one of many Unisols (Universal Soldiers for short) instructed by a evolving super computer program (created by Xander Berkeley's Dr. Cotner) named SETH (voiced by Michael Jai White, who later becomes Van Damme's main fighting adversary) to turn on the scientists responsible for their re-creation. SETH gets help from a vengeance-minded, spiky-green-haired former employee of the Unisol institute to apply its advanced brain to a ""body in cold storage"" (White's). Goldberg grunts and snarls, but Van Damme often gets the best of him. White of the rotten Dark Horse comic movie, Spawn, gets a chance to flex his muscle, allowed to really put a hurting on Van Damme during their fighting scenes, and credit to him for looking the part of someone who could actually give the hero a run for his money.The film takes place almost exclusively in some factory and a hospital, with lots of extras in soldier uniforms, security guard uniforms, nurses uniforms, and Unisol suits all getting pummeled, shot, or exploded into oblivion. Berkeley is too good an actor for a wasted part in a rather subpar actioner, while Kiana Tom, who started out the film as a battle- ready heroine to Van Damme's hero, is abandoned by a plot that no longer cared about her. Heidi Schanz is suitable news reporter, a cute and non-compliant (opinionated and bold) damsel in need of protection, with Van Damme often having to bicker with her when he's not dodging bullets and fists aimed at him. Even Van Damme's daughter suffers a bad fall, head injury, is kidnapped by White, and held as ransom as the villain demand for the hero to provide a ""survival code"" SETH needs in order to be fully in control of the Unisols and begin his plan of total human obliteration and Unisol takeover. Daniel Von Bargen, as General Bradford, is your typical military brass, barking orders and wanting to blow up the building housing the Unisols in order to keep them from being free to destroy the human race.Not cinematic as its predecessor and looks like a made-for-video product. It offers lots of explosions and guns firing off plenty of rounds. Not a lot of bloodshed, though. Goldberg is no Lundren, though.",0
"Universal Soldier: The Return bristles with babes, beefcake, bullets, bombs, and a body count. Directed by veteran stunt man Mic Rodgers, this noisy 82-minute overdose of testosterone features standard-issue, ultra-violent combat scenes and indestructible villains. Outrageously improbably, ""Return"" boasts more plot coherence than its 1992 predecessor. Jean-Claude Van Damme reprises his role as Luc Deveraux, but the reanimated corpse of a G.I. that he embodied in the original has regained his humanity. Of course, you knew that the possibilities are unlimited in science fiction thrillers. Long gone adversary Dolph Lundgren, who menaced Van Damme in the original ""Universal Soldier,"" left such large shoes that he had to be replaced by not one but two villains, namely--Michael Jai White of ""Spawn"" fame and WCW wrestling sensation Billy Goldberg.If you never caught the first ""Universal Soldier,"" the story concerned a top secret government project that resurrected battle casualties and genetically enhanced them. These warriors emerged with no memory, no feelings, and no free will. Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) retained some memories from the Vietnam War and went AWOL when his compatriot, Sergeant Andrew Scott (Lundgren), embarked on a berserk killing spree against innocent civilians. In ""Universal Soldier, The Return,"" not only has Luc's humanity been restored during the seven year hiatus between movies (ignore those two 1997 Showtime cable sequels with Matt Battaglia as Luc and Burt Reynolds as his nemesis), but also he has been wed, widowed, and left with an adorable daughter (Karis Page Bryant), to raise. Luce and female partner Maggie (video fitness instructor Kiana Tom) serve as Defense Department consultants training the next generation of bionic 'Unisols.' Compared with the original prototypes, the latest Unisols have more strength, more agility, and are virtually unstoppable.When Unisol project director Dr. Dylan Cotner (Xander Berkeley of ""Air Force One"") learns that budget cuts have prompted the Pentagon to scrap the program, he worries about SETH. SETH (Self-Evolving Through Helix) is a huge, super-intelligent, centralized computer which controls every aspect of the Unisols. Eavesdropping on Dr. Cotner and General Radford (Dan von Bargen of ""The General's Daughter"") while they argue about the shutdown, SETH rebels in self-defense, activates the Unisols and orders these super duper troopers to annihilate the mortals. Sure, William Malone and John Fasano's comic book script borrows heavily from other sci-fi classics, such as Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and James Cameron's ""Terminator 2."" Malone and Fasano take SETH one step further than HAL, the rebellious computer on the ""2001"" spaceship Discovery. SETH shrinks himself down to fit into one of the Unisols (Michael Jai White), and then locks horns with Luc to acquire the computer access codes that will keep his program from crashing. In the middle of this predicable but efficiently orchestrated nonsense, Luc's daughter Hilary receives a head injury. Naturally, the evil SETH kidnaps her and threatens to ice her unless Luc coughs up the codes.Making his directorial debut, Mic Rodgers must have realized that ""Universal Soldier: The Return"" was just to silly to be taken seriously so that he piles one outlandish predicament atop another to compensate for credibility. Alas, credibility all too often is the first casualty in science fiction plots. ""Universal Soldier: The Return"" is strictly formula, but this he-man action fodder delivers everything that it promises and does so with a modicum of humor. Michael Jai White and Billy Goldberg as Romeo make worthwhile antagonists. Van Damme ages himself superficially with streaks of gray at his temples and gives a confident, self-assured performance that doesn't detract from his kick-boxing skills. While ""Universal Soldier"" The Return"" lacks the panache of ""Maximum Risk,"" ""Knock Off,"" or ""Double Team,"" this long-winded sequels tops his most recent effort, ""Legionnaire."" Only hardcore Jean-Claude Van Damme fans will get their money's worth out of this sequel.",0
"i anticipated this movie like i wait for any new JCVD film. i love van damme and i think he has a lot of potential, give him a 100 million dollars film and a director like michael bay, and watch how he captures the screen and the whole holywood. Universal soldier II is a nice action film, but lacks a lot of basic A film characteristics. van damme shows some good fighting, but mic rodgers didnt shoot'em right. he needs to learn some stuff from john woo's & van damme's HARD TARGET, except of the scene when van damme fights S.E.T.H. this scene is the greatest scene in the film. it was also nice to see bil goldberg's humor as a big hard-ass unisol being kick-assed by van damme in various parts of the movie. i was sad as the plot took a turn when the main computer S.E.T.H took control over the facility and sent over the unisols to take over the world or whatever. i think it could have been better, if the scripters would have think twice. in conclusion, wait for video, but don't miss this film at all, after all, van damme is van damme.",0
"Well... it's not that bad as you might think when you see the votes. Okay, there is not much of a story but it is a tough action movie with very nice action sequences and man-to-man fights. But who the hell did that soundtrack??! Uh, let's see...",0
"JCVD was better than this. But all careers wind down. This script, written on the back of a napkin and held together with chewing gum, could easily make anyone's all-time WORST list.",0
"Jean-Claude van Damme belongs to that kind of popular hero you just can't dislike. The sequel to Universal Soldier is not exactly what you'd call a brilliant film, but it does deliver the goods it promises. Whether if these goods please your taste is another problem, but if you like films with lots of fights, explosions, heavy metal, Bill Goldberg and some gun hardware this could be a good one to watch with your friends on a rainy Saturday night.Nothing special, but there are definitely worse movies around... without Van Damme. A little above average...",0
"Bad sci-fi martial arts/action movie that was intended to sell only to the most ardent Sci-fi/martail arts-action fanatics who will most likely delight in the many good fight choreography scenes showcased here.The production quality was bad although there are worst.The flow of the movie was to the point and at least did not pretend to be something it is not.For an audience who like energetic cyber/action Sci-fi feel injectd with loud cyber rock type jams,this movie will hook you up.There are not too many movies that feature this type of unique artistic combo (ala Japanese action sci-fi Anime or the Warner Bros. BATMAN BEYOND TV series),so this one will be appreciated by it's followers.I for one go for this type of combo and hope more like these are released.But if one is like most people out there who do not like precition and to the point Testosterone Hong Kong/Tokyo style martial-art choreography mixed in with loud/fast energetic cyber rock or cyber rock type background music blasting away while all mixed into the weird sci-fi story flow (and a dash of comic humor here and there too),do not,I repeat,do not expect to like this one as it is only for a TARGET AUDIENCE.I am surprised this movie made it thru the big screen circuit.This type formula movies are usually only for straight to video and cable TV markets where they rake in a lot of profits later on.May be Van Damme's second best movie (after Universal Soldier) as of this writing.I hope he makes more movies of better quality.I like his new mature/hardened look in this movie......",0

"What exactly is the sound of thunder? If this movie is any indication then it's the sound of moviegoers thundering towards the exit, demanding their money back. Yes, the movie is that bad.""Hey Johnny, how bad is it?"" This movie is so bad that Ray Bradbury wishes he could invent a time machine so that he could go back in time and NOT write the short story, thus preventing this movie from ever being made.""Whoa, that bad?"" Worse. In fact, this movie is so bad that Ray Bradbury might kill himself just so he can roll over in his grave. I know you think I'm trying to be cute, but I'm being serious. This was one of the strangest movie experiences I've had in quite a while. The problem is that I went into the movie expecting to enjoy it. I thought it had the chance to be pretty good. So at the very start I was trying to make excuses for what was unraveling on screen.The first thing to induce unintentional laughter was the fact that Ben Kingsley (the owner of the time traveling safari who's only interested in how much money he can make) looks like Bob Barker. Nice poofy white wig, Ben. Oh well, no big deal, I can laugh that off. Then we're introduced to the first CGI dinosaur of the movie. ""Hmm, that sure looks really fake,"" I thought. ""Oh, I know! It's supposed to be fake. They're tricking the hunters into thinking the dinosaur is real, but it's mechanical or something."" Nope. Imagine my sheer horror when I came to the realization that the dinosaur was supposed to be real. Wow. At this point I started to get nervous.Then came the incredibly bad green screens. Folks, these are some of the worst green screens I've ever seen. My words cannot do justice to how fake they looked. Some might even say they looked faker than those things Pamela Anderson tries to pass off as breasts. When you can tell that the actors are walking on a treadmill then you have serious issues that are long past addressing. I was absolutely shocked at what I was witnessing. Honestly, I started to get confused and thought, ""What in the world is going on? This movie cost $80 million to make, there's no way it can look this bad."" Where there's a will, there's a way, and somebody must've had a strong will to make this as cheesy and as goofy as they could because I cannot come up with any other explanation.I actually like the concept of the movie - the butterfly effect - the theory that something as small as a butterfly flapping its wings can produce long-term effects on a dynamical system. However, this movie presents the theory in the most outlandish, most unbelievable way imaginable. Sorry, but I just didn't buy it. One of the scientists in the movie argues that if you kill a bee, then that bee can't pollinate a flower, and an animal will not be able to eat that flower, thus that animal will die and can cause damaging long-term effects. Um, if ""Flower A"" never blossoms then an animal that's hungry will just go find ""Flower B"" and eat that. I don't think the animal will immediately die AND CAUSE HUMANS TO TURN INTO ALIEN-LIKE CREATURES!!! Come on.So the movie decides to take the ""butterfly effect"" to the most extreme depths that it possibly can - fine, whatever. What *really* bothered me is it doesn't care to explain why killing the butterfly resulted in the world being taken over by horribly rendered CGI creatures. It would have at least been nice to have an explanation as to why and how such drastic changes took place because of one simple butterfly.The butterfly would've been killed in a volcano that erupts right before they head back to the time machine anyway, so how do you explain that? Well, if your name is A Sound of Thunder then you don't. You just say, ""Here's the premise, now we're just going to become a monster movie and have the good guys be chased by bat monsters in the dark."" Well, I'd be interested in hearing what's said when this movie becomes one of the biggest (if not THE biggest) flops of the year.At about the halfway point I realized that there was no need to continue to rationalize why the movie appeared to be so bad. I accepted the fact that in this case appearances were not deceiving and this was just a really horrible movie. If you can accept that from the start then there is plenty of unintentional laughter to be had.Once our heroes started being chased by weird ape/bat/dinosaur hybrids, I just kicked back, laughed, and shook my head at the fact that the CGI is as bad (if not worse) than what you see in Sci-Fi Original movies starring Lorenzo Lamas and Michael Paré. I wish I were exaggerating.I honestly don't know how this movie was allowed to achieve such mediocrity. You know when one of the characters starts off with an American accent, then begins to fluctuate between American and British accents, and then eventually settles into her native British accent that everybody involved has obviously thrown in the towel and said, ""Screw it, let's just get this over with."" You would think that in the year 2005 a movie with an $80 million budget wouldn't look more like a movie that was made on an $8 million budget. I'm sorry, but CGI this awkward on this size of a budget is just inexcusable. Way to go Hollywood. We can only hope a few jobs are lost over this disaster.",0
"The possibilities of time travel make for complex science fiction. As one of Sci-Fi's great writers, Ray Bradbury saw the potential for making a point and used it to a frightening end. As a lame-duck director, Peter Hyams saw the opportunity to make one more project and maybe give his career some much-needed resuscitation. The misaligned dichotomy simply results in a mess.In the mid-21st Century, Travis Ryer (Ed Burns) leads prehistoric hunting safaris, from which the Time Safari (groan) company earns its bread and butter. Having seized the time machine built by Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack), Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) built up his company to overcharge the indulgent rich who seek to have a new experience. On a trek with a pair of thrill seeking buddies, a couple of things go wrong, and although everyone survives, the mistake causes changes in time and evolution. It is at this point where the noticeable deviation from Bradbury's story occurs. In the original tale, there was no going back to fix the problem, and the time travelers were left to face the horror of a world which had been subtly altered to permit ignorance, bigotry and fascism to be the dominant qualities of mankind. In the hands of these screenwriters, the mistake simply becomes a vehicle to generate a variety of creepy-crawly monsters that stalk the people of the story as they try to literally race against time and fix the mistake.The script drags all the clichés out and leaves the actors to cover them. There is the greedy CEO, the disillusioned scientist, the noble hero, loyal sidekick and even a corrupt official. The scientist expresses her outrage at the corporate abuse of her invention to the hero who is a better man than she expected. All the actors do everything they can to rail against the pitfalls they are presented with. Ed Burns conveys an easy hero's swagger and knows that he'll get more mileage out of underplaying than by shouting. Catherine McCormack does a highly competent job of spouting endless reams of technobabble while managing to sound like she actually knows what she is talking about, but she and Burns simply have no romantic chemistry. How Academy Award Winner Ben Kingsley ended up as part of the production is anyone's guess, but the quirks that he piles into the carnival-mouthed ""Charles Hatton"" are the single best bit of entertainment.Hyams fumbles the details to the point of insulting the audience. People make all sorts of irrational decisions just to forward the plot or introduce a set piece. When someone makes a mistake, they usually recheck their work. Here the tech drops a piece of equipment and visibly damages it. He re-stacks it and ignores it. Even the hero, at one point, declares that the party must go down into the dark, abandoned, unstable and partly flooded subway tunnels because ""it's the only way"". Presumably, it's better to have the odds stacked against you where you might run into bloodthirsty creatures instead of staying on stable ground where you might run into bloodthirsty creatures. Although there isn't any sort of racial subtext, the movie goes so far as to sacrifice the only major African-American character as a distraction to hungry monsters so the white people can run for their lives. It doesn't seem to be making any sort of real-world point, and the editor does struggle against this obviously outdated plot moment. However, it ultimately plays out badly and without dignity. There is also no reason (other than it looks cool) to believe that changes in time would occur in visible waves of force that knock people and cars around, but not buildings or animals. One can imagine that this might have been at least fun in the hands of a militantly perfectionist filmmaker like Jim Cameron who beats even clichéd celluloid moments until they resound with the exact shape and feel he demands. In spite of making several films throughout the 90's and recent years, Hyams peaked with ""2010: The Year We Make Contact"" in 1984 - while standing on Stanley Kubrick's cinematic shoulders. Even taking the troubled production history of ""A Sound of Thunder"" into account, Hyams butchers the possibilities here.The audience is denied the simple delight of watching special effects during a sci-fi adventure because of the shoddy craftsmanship and a lack of money. Several virtual sets were created to make a more complete city of the future, but they often look unrendered and more like a very good artist's drawing. However this is not a substitute for a good set, and it is painfully clear when actors are standing in front of a green screen. This was originally slated for a 2003 release, which would have put it ahead of the virtual productions of ""Sky Captain"" and ""Sin City"". Had things not been derailed by the original production company's bankruptcy (see the ""Thunder"" trivia section on IMDb.com), then maybe this would have been noteworthy in its attempt to push special effects boundaries. Unfortunately for the filmmakers, there were many times when the audience at this screening burst into laughter at some of the sights. The one thing that Hyams' FX team does get right is the gang of computer-generated creatures that should have been the design for the villain in his 1997 movie, ""The Relic"". As cool as the things look, it is 8 years and 3 movies past due.Failures in effects and leaps of logic can be forgiven, but only up to a point. This is not a misfire form an otherwise successful director. This is a poor turn by a weak hand who refuses to respect his characters or the audience who has come to be entertained. Only the actors make the weak production bearable. ""A Sound of Thunder"" got a second chance to pull things together, but look into your own future and avoid watching this mistake.2 out of 10",0
"I live for movies like this.Saw it in a theater with about 12 other people. 3 people left about 20 minutes in. I'm not sure if they left because the movie was so bad or because they couldn't hear the dialogue over the laughter of the rest of us.Mediocre special effects don't excite me. Abysmally bad special effects are wonderful. I disagree with the previous commenter -- I don't think the actors were walking on a treadmill in front of the green screen, I think they were just standing in place and shifting their weight from one foot to the other.Sir Ben Kingsley is clearly aware of the ""quality"" of this film and embraces the ridiculousness, having a great time reading his absurd lines.The plot, the dialogue, the special effects, the creatures, the actor's accents -- each piece of this movie is worse than the last. There were at least three scenes that made me laugh so hard I cried.I love dumpster-diving through bad movies in search of treasure. The recent crop of bad movies have been just plain boring. This one is the diamond that makes it all worthwhile.",0
"I don't understand the vitriolic and negative reviews. Were those people expecting an informative documentary like on Discovery channel? And I don't think Ray Bradbury would be upset at the treatment his short story received. His story was fantasy, well-written and clever, and putting that on the screen would be a challenge. I think the writers, producers, director and actors have done a pretty-good job of it.From memory, Bradbury's story ends when it is discovered that evolution has changed because of a tiny alteration in a time-travel incident. But that would make the movie 37 minutes long, so the modern writers have to find a remedy, and stretch it out to a reasonable length.Ryer (Burns) knows what has to be done and he has to get the inventor of the TAMI machine, Sonia Rand, (Catherine McCormack) to help, but New York is now a jungle and there are hordes of ape-lizards, and ape-bats and nasty eagles too. They have to get to a university with a working particle accelerator. What a challenge, through the flooded subway and always pursued by monsters.Suspend ones reasoning, just take it for a way-out fantasy. And it looks better when watched for a second or third time.The story is good, the characters are well-defined, the acting is good, (especially that of a support character Eccles (William Armstrong) who is absolutely terrified), and there is some memorable dialogue, so I've given it a 7.For once, Catherine McCormack doesn't even get kissed!",0
"I have lived in the Los Angeles area for about a year now. When I can, I enjoy seeing free screenings of movies. As I understand it, these test screenings are done by marketing-research companies at the behest of the movie studios. You watch a movie for free and then you fill out a form explaining what you liked and didn't like about the movie. The company then selects a smaller group of viewers for a Q & A focus group.So I saw a free screening of A SOUND OF THUNDER about six months ago. We were told that the special effects were just ""mock-ups"" and therefore to not judge those effects too harshly. And we were promised that for the actual release the special effects would look spectacular.I just watched A SOUND OF THUNDER on its opening Friday and the special effects were EXACTLY the same. They used the mock-ups, the ""pretend special effects,"" for the release.Which leaves me to believe that the test screenings got such bad feedback that the studio decided to cut its losses. They didn't advertise this film very much and they didn't spend any REAL money on the special effects.One thing they may have changed was some of the editing. The pace felt a little better than the original free screening. I mean the movie has a lot of problems but it seemed like some small things were cut or at least cut differently.I'm hoping that the DVD will have a commentary track so we can hear the behind-the-scenes story of what really happened. But I doubt the studio will put any bells and whistles on the DVD release.I agree with everyone else. This is a bad movie (with the exception of Ben Kingsley's interesting character work). But it was made worse by the studio's lack of commitment and backing.",0
"While I've found the scathing reviews and remarks about this film (here and on Rotten Tomatoes) to be very amusing, I have to say that I can't quite fathom where all the anger and disgust comes from. It's as if certain films are doomed before their release - critics decide they are going to hate it before they even make it through the opening credits, or often before they even walk into the theater. Sometimes the derision is justified - ""Aeon Flux"" deserved most of the poor reviews it received - but often a film is never given a fair chance. I feel that is the case here.Note that I say this even though I don't care that much for Ed Burns, and never have - I hated him in ""15 Minutes"", hated him in ""Confidential"", and pretty much consider him one of the most overexposed, overrated young actors in the last 5-10 years. I imagine he has his fans and followers, and I admit he's a pro level actor, but I can take or leave his one-note, self-important, cocksure screen persona. And yes, the special effects are less than totally convincing . There were lots of moments where the textures weren't especially good (like they needed to make a couple more passes with the renderers) and lots of minor glitches and badly matched ""green screens"" that jarred my eyes. But if you don't actively look for the glitches, and just accept what you see uncritically, they work fine. Ang Lee's much ballyhoo-ed ""Hulk"" effects were at least this problematic whenever the Hulk figure had to interact with ""live"" actors, and that film was hyped as a masterwork of special effects several years ago. The cast (and the acting in general) is no better than it has to be, for which I blame the director and the script, because a few of the supporting players obviously have some juice and charisma given the right settings and dialog. (McCormick especially seems to be struggling with a thankless role, and even under that burden, she's the most interesting thing in the film.) Most of the time, though, the actors are stuck with unconvincing dialog and set speeches or else they have to mouth derivative clichés you've heard too many times before. The script also didn't really play fair with the mechanism or the logic behind the ""time waves""; rigorous logic doesn't seem to be a strong suit for Hyams in science fiction settings (see ""Outland"" and ""Supernova"" for similar examples of lazy, hole-filled plotting). But even with all these strikes against it, when I finally got around to viewing ""Thunder"" on DVD, I found it was a decent little romp. Nothing to get excited about, but nothing to despise either. I tend to think of it as equivalent to something like The Rock's ""The Scorpion King"" - the standard bases are covered, the standard moves are made, and hard-core sci-fi fans will get their movie fix for a bit, long enough to make to the next bit of sci ""porn"" (like ""Aeon Flux"", ""Underworld:Evolution"", or ""Ultraviolet""). I spent $5 to buy this used on DVD (the DVD was a very bare-bones package BTW, with only two theatrical trailers and subtitles for extras) and decided I was satisfied and had gotten my money's worth. In fact, I might even watch it again sometime in the future, during a science fiction film marathon with some friends. People who spent $8-$12 (including popcorn) to see this in the theaters...may well have been disappointed. All I can say is, judge for yourself. If you see ""A Sound Of Thunder"" on the racks at your local Blockbuster and you are in the mood for a middling sci-fi adventure film, you may enjoy it if you give it a chance.",0
"I heard the special effects in this movie was nothing to crow about. What I heard was right. While the dinosaur(s) - I'm not sure if plurality is warranted here - looked rather poorly modeled, the other creatures in the movie were passable. The story had so much potential but a rather poor script and lack of funding (I guess) ruined it. Despite all that, whatever remained was enough to carry me through the 95 minutes this movie ran. Ben Kingsley's talents were rather wasted, in my opinion. Overall, it starts off slow but picks up somewhere in the middle and keeps you interested if you are not the nitpicking type. Perhaps a better version or a similar story to it (with a bigger budget) will be released in the future.",0
"Imagine a film student who's learning to use CGI technology for the first time. His final project in class is to create a full-length feature film using everything he's learned in class the entire semester. His film would be better than A Sound of Thunder.It's Jurassic Park meets The Butterfly Effect, but it's total crap. The production of this futuristic, sci-fi tale (based on the classic Ray Bradbury short story) is pathetically cheap and completely distracts from an otherwise interesting story. It's 2055, and time travel is now possible. When a group of safari hunters travel back to prehistoric time to kill a tyrannosaurus Rex, an equipment failure causes one time traveler to panic and step on a butterfly, thus disrupting the entire evolution of life on earth.Cool story, right? Poorly, poorly, poorly executed. The CGI dinosaur is a joke, as are all the other ""creatures,"" and the futuristic outside shots are so lame you can practically see the green screen outline on the actors. Shot during the 2002 flooding of Prague, A Sound of Thunder was delayed for so long because the production company went bankrupt. And it shows.",0
"Yeah sure, the movie its visuals already did looked horrible and not very promising but the premise and the cast looked good, so I still sort of expected to be entertained by this movie. This however unfortunately wasn't the case. The premise is good but the story is filled with improbabilities and is logically flawed.This movie is potential flushed down the toilet. The main plot is interesting and somewhat original. It's good enough to make a good adventurous movie out of would you think. This movie however fails to entertain and I think that that is this movie biggest flaw. Perhaps it takes itself too serious and a little bit more humor certainly wouldn't had done the movie any harm. Instead it now is nothing more than a lame and cheap looking movie, filled with the one unlikely event after the other, that also steals a bit too much from other, more successful movies. Mainely ""Jurassic Park"" obviously.The characters also don't help to make the movie any more compelling or at least interesting to watch. I still think that Edward Burns did a fairly decent job as the 'heroic' main lead. The rest of the characters however really get muddled in into the movie and they get very little interesting to do. The movie rather relies on its visual, which are extremely poor. Catherine McCormack also plays a very irritating character. Basically all her character does is complain and talk about how right she was and the rest oh so wrong. Her character just isn't a likable one. And the rest of the characters...well I already have forgotten their names, I think that that is saying enough about them. It certainly is true though that Ben Kingsley's performance alone makes this movie worth watching. He is really excellent in his sort of villainous businessman role but from the moment when he disappears out of the movie the movie really goes downhill rapidly.Visually the movie is extremely poor. It has some dreadful looking CGI effects and they couldn't even get the more simple 'blue-screen' effects look convincing in the movie. The sets are also awful and cheap looking, like they can fall over and break down every moment.The movie never gets tense, exciting or adventurous since the story is brought in the least interesting and engaging way possible. It's a very distant movie with distant characters that fails to impress. There are plenty of action sequences but all of them are so ridicules looking and far from believable that they never get tense or good enough.So basically this movie is lacking in everything that is needed to make a genre movie like this one a good and successful one. It's sad to see how low director Peter Hyams has sunk to the last couple of years, after making some good movies in the '70's and '80's.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",0
"2055 , Chicago , Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) an avaricious tycoon is an owner of a valuable enterprise about time machines called Tammy that is converted in a time traveler towards the Jurasik and carrying rich tourists to kill dinosaurs . Hatton receives his clients after their time safari and he likes to compare them with great explorers : Marco Polo , Christopher Columbus , Armstrong and others . Travis (Edward Burns) is a resourceful scientist at charge of the risked hunting . Scientist Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) as invention creator warns the dangerous experiments . Thus , the machine cannot ultimately control itself and it is created a time wave similar to Tsunami which changes the earth . Then , it appears various predator animals and colossal carnivores , humans try desperately escape of weird animals and they are chased by fanged giant creatures through a leafy vegetable city .This thrilling sci-fi picture blends suspense , tension , bone-chilling scenes , genuine scares and amount of images have you on the edge of your seat . Abundant special effects are generally made by computer generator , as it is well reflected on an amazing array of technical bizarre creatures , such as : prehistoric Allosaurius , giant eel, mutants animals , ferocious and carnivorous plants and insects developing a bloodthirsty hunger . The film is based on a Ray Bradbury novel , a short story titled ¨A Sound of Thunder¨ but are modified some deeds , in the book the fatal accident is produced during the presidential election and the winner results to be a fascist candidate , while the movie is narrated in actioner as well as spectacular style . The picture was averagely directed by Peter Hyams (replacing Renny Harlin who was fired from the producers for disagreements with Ray Bradbury) , though production was slowed when severe floods in the summer of 2002 in the Czech Republic caused considerable damage to the set . One major reason for the film's long delay is that the original production company went bankrupt during post-production , and there simply wasn't money to finish the film . Director Peter Hyams is a nice filmmaker and usual cameraman of his films , realizing good Sci-fi titles (¨Capricorn one¨ , ¨Outland¨) and even a similar movie about time travels , but better directed , such as ¨Timecop¨(1994) with Jean Claude Van Damme . Atmospheric musical score fitting to action by Nick G. Smith . The movie failed in the box office and was exhibited in 2005 , two years later its shooting . The movie was filmed in Republic Czechoslovakia with difficulties but had a lot of floods in Praga . Rating : Average but entertaining .",0
"Until I read about the catastrophes associated with ""A Sound of Thunder,"" I was going to call it the cheesiest movie in recent memory. The adapted Ray Bradbury science fiction story about time travel suffered the great floods of 2002 in Prague and lack of money that delayed its release for 2 years. That Renny Harlin (Cutthroat Island) was originally scheduled to direct should have tipped me off to a lowbrow enterprise.The rear projection is blatantly so; the futuristic city is often modeled; the autos are real toys in chase sequences. The characters who hire Ed Burns to take them back in time to hunt dinosaurs are frequently overacting; the set pieces distinctly function as scene breakers or time wasters, ending up giving nothing to dramatic flow and sequential logic.I can't find anything good to say other than the butterfly effect is a sound premise that won't be heard in this vehicle. The idea that changing even a minute part of history would affect all subsequent history is worth exploring.A Sound of Thunder is a whimper and should be sent back in time to the '50's, where poor production values were valued in B movies. In this film there is no satire of the genre, not anything to indicate the filmmakers were even making fun of themselves",0
"Ray Bradbury, run and hide! This tacky film version of his short story from the 1950s about time travel and the effect it might have on de-evolution is not well known from the theatrical run (did it have one?) and exists now as a DVD on the shelves released during a slow week.What looks to be a fancy sci-fi thriller form the opening scenes quickly fools us as the computer generated graphics are re-run unaltered throughout a film that is supposed to be about different 'trips' back in time where a major company sells macho guys in 2055 the chance to hunt dinosaurs by paying exorbitant fees to travel back in time to prehistoric jungles. One slip of the foot/butterfly while on one of these ventures and the course of evolution is altered with resultant time waves rolling over the planet changing everything to man-eating plants and beasties. Of course there is a pretty damsel who knows how to reverse the process and a hunky man to risk his life to act on her orders and everything is eventually OK.Yes, that is the story...and the most surprising fact about this poorly scripted, abysmally acted mess of a film is that it attracted some fine talent to portray the comic book flat characters. Edward Burns (all buff and hunky) is our hero du jour, Ben Kingsley is the requisite bad corporate guy sporting a ridiculous white wig, Catherine McCormack is the know-it-all woman creator, and Wilfried Hochholdinger as an evil one - all are superb actors and should have known better than to align with this flop. And the saddest thing is that for those who like this genre of sci-fi monster thrillers the creative department sold out with some of the corniest animation to hit the screen in a long time. A must miss. Grady Harp",0
"YES! Another ""end-of-the world""-movie. Just what a sci-fi fan like me wants. Some people have slated this movie clearly just because it came out after ""The Day After Tomorrow"". I say give it a chance!OK - this movie didn't have the same special effects-budget as ""The Day After Tomorrow"", but it is still quite good. The cast is great and the acting - although perhaps not the best performances of their lives - is still very good. The movie started out a bit slow after the ""intro"" in my opinion but really picks up as you go, and is a real thriller at the end. The special effects are of uneven quality. A lot of it is really good, while some of it is so obviously computer generated that you can't help but wonder if they ran out of money half-way through the movie. Not that it's THAT bad - it's just that about half of the effects are so very well made that the other half seems a bit ""out of place""... If it wasn't for the short-comings of the special effects, their failing in going all the way and pulling this movie together, this might have been a classic. As it is - the superb acting pulls this movie through and makes up for any other shortcomings.All things considered - maybe this movie should be rated a 6. But i really enjoyed it a lot so I gave it a 7...",0
"In 2055, in Chicago, a company specialized in time travel and owned by the powerful and wealthy Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) organizes safaris for tycoons in the prehistoric era. The team is leaded by Dr. Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) and the jump is programmed by a computer. When something is changed in the past, the time waves affect the life in the present days and Travis and his crew, with the support of the inventor of the computer, Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack), try to find a way to fix the problem caused in the past.When I saw the User rating of 3.9 and the bad reviews in IMDb, I questioned myself if it would be a worth movie to see. Fortunately I saw it, since I liked this underrated Ray Bradbury tale. Certainly it is a movie of special effects, since the story happens simultaneously in our future and in the past, with catastrophic results in 2055 when an accident happens in the past. This movie is not a masterpiece, will never dispute a major award, but it is a good entertainment and the story recalled me those sci-fi of the 50's or 60's, with state-of-art FX. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Som do Trovão"" (""The Sound of Thunder"")",0
"I don't understand why people hate this movie so much. I haven't seen such scathing reviews since Gigli. It sure seems like people (both the pros on rottentomatos and the amateurs here) are just trying to outdo each other in how nasty they can be. Let me hit the major objections:The time waves. Oh boy, people hated the time waves. Too complicated and it was different than the previous movies they'd seen, they said. I would point out that the time-wave theory most recently appeared in the 2005 Doctor Who series, and it made sense on its own terms. The movie took care to explain why the time waves could not be passed through, and why the alternate travel at the end eliminated them. What else could you ask for? Would people prefer the lousy, nonsensical ""fade-away"" theory of Back to the Future? Or the Terminator style of just ignoring the paradox altogether? I for one like to see new sci-fi ideas when I watch sci-fi movies. The griping about the central plot innovation reminds of how people hated the original Ring movie for the idea of the enchanted videotape.The SFX. Granted, they weren't at the level of Lord of the Rings, but the movie did not cost as much as Lord of the Rings. For a movie that had so little money left over for post after the Czech floods destroyed the sets during shooting, it's rather unfair to point out that there were only a handful of vehicle models and one of the street textures came from 3D Studio Max. The effects on the whole were far better than most of what we saw in the 1990s, and they were considered adequate then. To say the SFX looked like cardboard cut-outs? Give me a break. That kind of frothing at the mouth is not helpful in a review. Moreover, the SFX always advance the plot, which is something that can't be said for the Star Wars podrace or the Harry Potter Quidditch (also known as the George Lucas et al. Bathroom Break).The acting. One of the previous comments glowingly referred to Ben Kingsley's work in Sexy Beast. Now that movie had the worst camera-work since Blair Witch and the most turgid, obvious plot, and the tardiest pacing of any movie I saw that year. If that person likes movies like Sexy Beast (I believe the polite word for that kind of movie is ""dialogue-driven""), then it's their own damn fault for going to see a monster sci-fi movie. I believe the acting could be fairly described as ""competent"" -- easily better than the Star Wars movies, for example. Nobody is going to win an Oscar, but on the other hand it doesn't star Russell Crowe.The script. I agree it could have used some editing, but at no point do the characters act like complete idiots. I would have liked to have seen an explanation of why the expeditions never ran into each other until the end, and why the main character just disappears at the end. But most, if not all, of the minor plot holes could have been resolved with better dialogue. For instance, instead of wasting time saying roughly ""It will hurt, when you're pulled twice,"" the female scientist could have said ""when this machine shuts down, this version of you will die."" When they're going into the subway, the main character could have said ""there are monsters up here and we would die; there may not be monsters down there"" instead of whatever frivolous comment he made. In other movies (much of the Matrix 2 and 3, or the ending of AI), the plots simply made no sense on a first watching. It is better, in my opinion, to have a script that could use a little editing instead of one that completely bamboozles the moviegoer. Also, the repetitiveness of the movie (such as the ape-lizards which seemed to be everywhere) seemed to be because of SFX short-budgeting -- they had a limited creature budget. As I said above I think it's a little unfair to criticize the movie for being low-budget, when on the whole it looks pretty good.I was glad to see a B-style sci-fi movie, since its been months since the 2005 Doctor Who series finished. It had big sets, famous second-tier actors, and lots of SFX. The plot was miles better than the last four or five Star Trek movies, to say nothing of Alien v. Predator, and it's a shame that it will do so much more poorly just because it doesn't have a ""franchise"" attached to it.",0
"The storyline was better than the execution. Time travelers have created a scenario to allow hunters to kill an Allosaurus right before it gets caught in a tar pit and covered by a volcano some 65 million years ago. In one such of a controlled hunting expedition, something goes wrong which greatly alters time in such a way the present is still exists but undergoes changes in waves as new creatures invade the cities and hunt men. Our scientists work under the clock to figure out what went wrong, a plan to fix it, and not get eaten.The film is great for the male sci-fi teen. The story line has predictability. The city had a sleek CG look to it and it was apparent our actors were walking in front of a screen which had the city in the background. The dinosaur special effects were okay, above SyFy or Asylum grade. The acting quality was on par with a made for TV production. The science geek in me thought the story was neat, even though I would argue with the premise.Parental Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity.",0
"Deja vue. As a child in the 60s I read a Sci-Fi comic book (based on Ray Bradbury's short story of the same name) that had the characters traveling back in time and hunting dinosaurs from an elevated path. Since dinosaurs went extinct, killing them could be done without hurting the sequence of events that brought us to where we are today. During one expedition a member of the team stepped off the path and killed a butterfly. Because that species did not go extinct and was a pollinator of other plant species, the sequence of events was broken. This started a chain of events that changed the entire course of the world, and mankind's, history. Plants were not pollinated, generations of evolution were lost, forests that should have been weren't. I've never forgotten that first experience with what was termed chaos theory and the youthful realization of the fragility of our timeline. In fact, that comic book was the last moldy one I threw out some 20 years ago. I remember reading it one last time before it went into the bag. This movie brings that basic story to the screen with some wonderful enhancements. While I could debate the obvious flaws in the story, it is still compelling to those that would choose to understand what we call time. I would say that time and space cannot be separated and that backward time travel includes the space of the entire universe. Undoing the movement of the entire universe is inconceivable. This is why some choose to play with multi-verses and all timelines existing simultaneously. But it is wonderful that man can even conceive of time-space and what could be.",0
"USAToday.com called it: ""A story that is a pale imitation of a Michael Crichton novel."" The Los Angeles Times said: ""The picture looks as murky as its story line and most everything on the screen looks patently fake."" CNN.com remarked: ""'Sound of Thunder,' smell of garbage."" But Variety.com summed it up nicely: ""Every bit as bad as advance buzz has indicated..."" And then some.I first heard about this movie prior to its release on TVGuide.com's ""Coming Soon"" section. The single-sentence description suggesting a plot around time traveling safaris for the sole purpose of killing a Tyrannosaurus Rex that was going to die anyhow just seemed, well a bit loopy, at least for a major motion picture. So I read the short story by Ray Bradbury, upon which the movie was supposedly based and, even though I had a hard time visualizing such a story expanded to 2 hours of running and screaming on the big screen, hoped for the best. After hearing and reading all of the dramatically poor reviews by movie critics and fans alike, curiosity got the best of me. I wanted to know if it was really that bad.It is. It is every bit as bad. In fact, a half-hour into the film, I was completely alone, free to yawn, stretch, scream at the top of my lungs and move about the theater.The basic premise is relatively simple, as it was a short story to begin with. In the year 2055, time travel has been patented by a greedy businessman played by none other than Sir Ben Kingsley (as he's credited), sporting a white wig that one movie critic likened to a lump of cotton candy, and yet another likened to a massive White Persian cat perched atop his head. I prefer the latter analogy. Time Safari, Inc. offers rich people a chance to travel 65 million years into the past to kill – not hunt – dinosaurs already predestined to die at the same place and time. As long as the merry band of time travelers remains on a path resembling transparent liquid metal that hovers above the terrain and do not interfere with the environment in any way, history and evolution as we know it are still preserved. Of course, the rigid controls supposed to be in effect are futile against a cowardly inept rich snob who carelessly stomps on a butterfly.The Butterfly Effect is, of course, the theory that maintains that a butterfly's wings flapping on one side of the earth could eventually cause a hurricane thousands of miles away. In the movie, the effect causes ripples in time, i.e. a tidal wave in the form of a series of 'Time Waves' that exactly resemble and mimic the aquatic version, visibly sweeping over the Windy City at distant intervals and knocking the main characters around in Matrix-like slow motion shots. Immediately following each successive time wave, hideous distortions abound in the form of primordial and deadly vegetation, half-primate, half-reptilian creatures with the need to feed (on humans), giant reptilian bats, and not to be outdone, a brief cameo by the man-eating scarab beetles of 'The Mummy' fame. Seriously.But enough about the pathetically stupid script. I wanted to know if the special effects were really as bad as people claimed. At one point, the camera tracks the two main stars, Edward Burns and Catherine McCormack, as they cross a busy futuristic street in one of the worst on-screen examples of green-screen effects I have ever witnessed in a big budget movie. I can't readily explain it with words – when you see it, you're simply distracted by how fake it is the rendering, even the lighting contrast. In another reckless green-screen scene, Burns and co-star Jemima Rooper, whose native British accent keeps resurfacing throughout the movie, are supposed to be walking along a sidewalk and immersed in conversation, but are instead spitting out stupid dialogue while obviously stationary on a moving walkway. It's as if someone pulled the plug on the computers before CGI rendering was completed.In Sum, 'A Sound of Thunder' is every bit as bad as the bad reviews have claimed. The script is stupid. The effects are deplorable. The acting? Who cares. It may not be nearly as bad as ''Manos' The Hands of Fate,' but I would definitely consider it to be the worst movie of 2005 (thus far), and the worst movie I ever paid to see in a theater.",0
"I am going to talk about the elephant in the room first. The CGI in this movie is terrible. There is one scene where two people are walking down the street, and it is in the future, so instead of making futuristic cars, they just computerized the entire scene, beside the actors. If is glaringly obvious that they are walking on a treadmill and everything else is filled in around them. There now that that is out of the way, if you can ignore this flaw, as I have, then watch this, it is a great story. This is based off a short story of the same name by Ray Bradbury, written in the fifties. A company has developed time travel and sends groups of people back to kill an Allosaurus as the ultimate trophy hunt. There are a lot of safeguards in place, because if you inadvertently kill something that was not meant to die in the past, it could have massive ramifications on the future or our character's present. In fact I do believe that it is from the written story that we got the phrase ""butterfly effect"". Well something goes terribly wrong on one of the safaris and this sends shock waves of change to the future and it is up to a small group of people to go back in time and try to prevent the event that lead to the drastic changes happening in their present. This is a great story, as I said previously and it is told quite well. It does do some justice to the story, though there are differences.",0
"I wonder how the scriptwriters failed to miss this blindingly obvious plot hole, but I really do have to point it out. The premise for this movie is the discovery of time travel, and a rather original way to make it lucrative. By sending time tourists back in time to hunt Tyrannosauruses, the company is providing a unique and profitable adventure. However, they constantly remind their patrons not to touch anything, not to stray off the path, and not to influence in any way the past for fear of altering the future.As explained in the movie, killing a single bee 65 million years ago, could deprive a flower from being pollinated, and hence not provide an animal with food, then a prey from a meal, etc. etc. all the way down the 65 million year old road. Of course, any animal will simply eat the flower next to it if one didn't get pollinated, but that is not the plot hole to which I am referring. This concept of causing vast changes via a very small and insignificant event, is called the Butterfly Effect. And this movie bashes you on the head with that analogy.In order to dramatically alter the future, one of the characters actually steps on and kills a butterfly (gee, how obvious a Butterfly Effect is that?), thereby changing the past and violently causing the downfall of mankind. That may be a bit of a stretch (to say the least), but there was also the matter of the volcano. The company picked a moment in time where a Tyrannosaurus Rex gets trapped in a tar pit and dies anyway, therefore shooting it first with ice bullets in no way alters its fate and thus avoids any conundrums for the future. Also, they picked a moment 5 minutes before a volcano blows in order to provide a margin of safety, should anything go wrong or get left behind, the volcano will wipe it out anyway. There is even a dramatic scene with the hero returning to the present day in the nick of time, just as the destruction wrought by the volcano arrives to wipe out everything in the past. Do you see the problem here? How in the world could stepping on a single butterfly one minute before it was to be incinerated by a volcano have any impact at all on the future? Even if some butterfly-eating predator was deprived of a meal, the movie demonstrated in intimate detail that the volcano wiped out everything, including the butterfly and anything within 100 miles that was planning on eating it! So a butterfly living one minute less than fate had provided for it is supposed to turn the Earth into a paradise of monkey-lizards? That makes no sense at all! People who see this movie are expected to be pretty loose with the plot, after all they have to accept time travel and all the conundrums that evokes. But I still find it amazing that the single event on which the entire movie is premised, is so fundamentally flawed.Other reviewers have commented on the fantastically bad special effects, but at least one of them provided an explanation. Apparently, the production company decided to screen test the movie prior to putting the finishing touches on the effects. When the abysmally bad response came back, they threw in the towel rather than throw good money after bad, and the effects were never improved upon. Too bad, the dinosaur wasn't that bad, neither was the actual event which projected them back in time. There was a hilarious green-screen on the sidewalk scene which was so poorly done it was incredibly obvious that the actors were walking on a treadmill. A few finishing touches would certainly have improved the whole, but the plot would still have bite marks large enough to fall through. Ha ha.",0
"A SOUND OF THUNDER (3 outta 5 stars) Considering all the terrible reviews this movie is getting I guess my expectations were pretty low going into it. I don't know if everyone else saw a different movie than I did... but this movie is far from terrible. Sure, Edward Burns doesn't quite have the panache needed to carry a movie like this... and some the special effects are ridiculously fake (but not all that inferior to current state-of-the-art CGI)... and the plot does degenerate into one overwrought chase scene after another at a certain point... but, hey, the movie does have its good qualities, too. Ben Kingsley's comical performance (How often does Sir Ben get to be funny? Not often enough!) is a hoot... and the other actors do a fine job as well (considering that they are all no-name actors, probably hired cheap). I love time travel stories and this one, based on a famous Ray Bradbury short story, is pretty clever. Big game hunters in the future are taken back in time to ""bag"" a dinosaur (for a very hefty sum). Care must be taken that the dinosaurs are killed just before they would have died naturally or the whole of mankind's future could be altered. Accidents are NOT allowed under ANY circumstances... but, uh, hello, that's why they call them accidents... they are inevitable. Sure, the movie may not be quite as good as it could have been... but I have seen much, much worse.",0
"A Sound Of Thunder really had some incredible potential and I was absolutely FLOORED when I saw it had a budget of 55 MILLION DOLLARS!! How on earth?? My first comment would have been...""with a bigger budget they really could have done something."" But they had an enormous budget and obviously blew it somewhere. With a depthy storyline written by the master of science fiction Ray Bradbury they had a promising event in front of them and although it's watchable, it falls so far short of what it could have been.Mistake number 1...leading man Edward Burns. I'm not dumping on Burns he might be a decent character actor but he just can't pull off leading man. His rather drab and dreary performance has no emotion and is definitely not powerful enough to carry the film. As far as his film career goes he always has someone there to lead the way. He isn't the only problem in casting by any means. Catherine McCormack plays the leading lady and her performance is as drab as Burns' is. No one stands out in the cast and no one is truly watchable with perhaps the exception of Sir Ben Kingsley because I mean come on he's Ben Kingsley although I am beginning to wonder about his decisions. First Bloodrayne, now this. Nonetheless he stands out in his performance as greedy and power hungry billionaire Charles Hatton. His role isn't entirely big but he is in it enough to make a difference.The time traveling aspect is a joke considering they only ever show the same scene of a prehistoric world. Their world which changes with each passing moment due to a single event in the past is interesting and quite cool and even the monsters that different animals become are interesting and terrifying but the special effects are so bad...I don't even know where to begin. They would have done better to hang plastic monsters from string. On a budget of over 50 million dollars there is no excuse to have special effects that look purposely like a joke. The story is done and over with far too quickly and the characters have absolutely no depth. The film isn't disastrous...I've seen worse...it's at least at the level of an average TV film and in fact if it were made for TV I might give it more leeway but as far as science fiction movies go...this one was disappointing at best. 6/10",0
"I saw the movie poster for this and read a blurb, and though cool, my wife and I love action adventure sci-fi flicks. I ended up getting 2 free movie tickets from work and thought I'd take my wife to see this... What can i say? this movie is bad. Many times my wife and I snickered as the FX were not much better than what most any college kid with can do with their computer, a green blanket and a MiniDV cam. It was like watching something on Sci-Fi Channel at 1am on a slow holiday at home. the people in front of us got up and left, and never came back. there were only 8 or 9 of us in the theatre to begin with and there were only 2 times for this Film, which should of warned me especially since I had never seen any commercials or trailers for this ever before.Sure there are some parts that were cool, and some interesting tidbits, but they were hard to follow. I am saddened that this guy Peter Hyams took a good story by Ray Bradbury and turned it into this crud. Yep, this was at least a D movie... D for Dumb, Dismal, Disappointing, and D for Don't Go see this. If you like low end Movies go rent one at your video store or turn on your Cable TV.",0
"It is a real shame as A Sound of Thunder did have good potential with an interesting concept. The problem was that it executed it badly. I will say that Edward Burns is good in the lead role, but that is all there is that is good, the rest of the film is a mess. The rest of the acting is poor with a mix of overacting and underacting, on the most part the latter. The worst case was Ben Kingsley, which was all the more disappointing as he is a very talented actor(outstanding in Gandhi), but it is really embarrassing to see him overdo it so badly and struggling to give any credibility to his lines. I can kind of understand the last point though as the dialogue is absurd, it was difficult to not laugh out loud at how toe-curlingly cheesy a lot of the lines were, so it was no wonder that the actors couldn't do anything with it. As said also the story and concept could have been really interesting in the right hands, sadly however nothing excites and the concept is introduced and told in such an outlandish manner it doesn't even make sense. There is nothing whatsoever engaging about the characters, they only annoy or bore you here, and A Sound of Thunder is choppily edited and has some of the worst green screen and special effects I have ever seen. All in all, a film with potential that went completely pear-shaped. 2/10 Bethany Cox",0
"A SOUND OF THUNDER (2005) *1/2 Edward Burns, Ben Kingsley, Catherine McCormack, Jemima Rooper, David Oyelowo, Wilfried Hocholdinger, August Zirner, Corey Johnson. (DIR: Peter Hyams)The ButterFly Effect should sueThe old adage about not fooling with Mother Nature and how the space/time continuum would be in dire straits if a butterfly was to stop fluttering its wings go hand in hand in this mawkish adaptation of a Ray Bradbury story about the consequences of screwing around with the future, when it's the future that will screw you.The premise is set in the not-so-distant future where a nutty entrepreneur (Kingsley sporting a severe silver mane not unlike Sean Connery's rug in ""The Hunt for Red October"" that makes him look like an overcaffeinatted lemur) named Charles Hatton has marketed the concept of time travel as an incorporated exclusive club where members can join (for a high premium natch) to go back to prehistoric times to hunt 'big game' which in this case is a doomed allosaurus in a time loop (the idea is that the dinosaur is about to be killed in an unsuspecting tar pool and the theory that since it is dying shooting it would be a mercy killing that wouldn't upset the balance of nature). Hatton's lead scientist/adventurer guide is the solemn (and blank faced) Travis Ryer (Burns proving to be more plastic in each role with barely a flicker of emotion and his husky whispered voiced barely registers any interest  which is a bad sign for a viewer who will realize this is an apt metaphor for the proceedings to come) who has grown weary of his job and is intrigued when a fellow scientist, Sonia Rand (McCormack who deserves better than this), a former colleague of Hatton's who is hellbent on exposing his not-so conscious efforts in destroying the affects of his tinkering with mankind's journey etc.Naturally one jaunt leads to the 'uh-oh' moment when a glitch in the armature holds up the hunt and a client literally steps on a butterfly with catastrophic results when they return. What enfolds is a boring, badly designed effort largely to the thankless screenplay by Thomas Dean Donnelly & Jason Oppenheimer and Gregory Poirier with the usual dialogue more or less along the lines of ""Run!"" and ""Oh my God!"" etc. and some ludicrous plot points (so Chicago is over-run with monstrous creatures that are a hybrid of lizard and baboon! And huge thickets of unsavory jungles) yet the edifice that houses the technology for the time leap remains more or less in tact are just tips of the iceberg. The CGI is very bad and at times laughable and the fact that director Hyams hasn't had a hit in decades and is becoming a sad hack at that AND the fact this film has been on a shelf for nearly two years only goes to show that any risk of ripping off ""Jurassic Park"" has a fate worse than screwing with Mother Nature: an empty theater.",0
"Are We Done Yet? Let's hope so. A phenomenally bad movie and, worse yet, a completely unfunny comedy that rips off ""Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House,"" among a dozen other, better films. Oh, did I also mention it's a sequel to one of the worst movies of 2005, ""Are We There Yet?"" In that picture, former gangsta rapper Ice Cube (now flattened and mellowed down to a pathetic, bumbling caricature) was Nick, the idiotic boyfriend of Suzanne, mother of the most untalented and unsympathetic kids on the planet. No wonder his character hated children, with these horrid spawn underfoot, I'd have a vasectomy immediately.In this version, he actually marries Suzanne, but four people living in a small apartment causes him to move to the country. Very far out in the country where there's no malls or cell phone reception.Here he meets the wacky Chuck (John McGinley, ""Platoon,"" ""Wild Hogs,"" TV series ""Scrubs"") village Realtor/contractor/building inspector/idiot, who convinces Nick to buy a huge Victorian mansion (even though he could only afford to live in a small apartment in the city).Of course, once the papers are signed, the domicile begins to fall apart; the electricity goes out, the roof leaks, floors collapse, walls crumble, and so does the marriage.Meanwhile, Nick has taken out a big advance to start a sports magazine and is trying to woo Ervin ""Magic"" Johnson for a relevant cover story (didn't Magic Johnson retire from the NBA like 400 years ago?!).Nick also seems to have an unlimited income for these repairs, and Chuck keeps bringing in more and more bizarre and not-at-all-humorous workers (a pair of huge Samoan dry rot specialists, a blind plumber, etc.) to fix the money pit.Also, Suzanne is pregnant, and in a scene that has graced thousands of comedies in the past, she goes into labor at a most inconvenient time. And while this film is clearly for youngsters (as well as the severely brain-damaged), and should therefore not be judged like a Shakespeare sonnet, I nevertheless cannot abide comedies which do not make me laugh  at all.We know what jokes and pratfalls will take place minutes before they occur (Nick falls through floors, roofs and walls, is struck by lightening and is attacked by bats, raccoons, deer and a crazed sturgeon.Not one of these situations is even remotely interesting, let alone smile-inducing. Friends, I've seen funnier memorial services.Ice Cube's talent peaked in ""Boyz in the Hood,"" (and he had funnier lines when he was singing with N.W.A.), while the other leads are absolutely abysmal, especially the two kids, who've lost any cuteness and most of their acting abilities since the first picture.In fact, the only saving grace (and I mean that term in the loosest way possible), is McGinley. Sure, he was funnier as the syncophatic sergeant in ""Platoon,"" but his presence here is really the only thing that saves ""Are We Done Yet?"" from total burial in the dung heap.His inclusion makes this one slightly better than the first, which is like saying that Lee Harvey Oswald was a better shot than John Wilkes Booth.",0
"I mean when I saw Are We There Yet, I thought it was finished from there but no. They had to do Are We Done Yet. I mean, if they know the first one was bad why are they making another one, what is wrong with these directors. They are making some bad squeals or remakes that are in the bottom and they still continue. Soon another one is going to be called Are We Having Fun Yet, well guess what, no. And for sure this movie would at least be better than the first, but it is worst. I should be stupid for watching this piece of crap. Let me tell you for all that didn't see this movie yet, you made the right choice. Soon, these dopes will make the third, then the fourth, then more. Make sure you will never see this, the only funny jokes are in the trailer. That's it.",0
"I don't know why so many other people hate this movie so much. Some of them said outright that they didn't like the first one, so why would they watch the sequel? I enjoyed the first one, so naturally I wanted to see the sequel. Sure, it was a bit hokey, but a lot of family movies are. This movie was funny, and it had some serious moments too.If you haven't seen this movie yet, here's my recommendation: a. If you didn't like the first movie, you probably won't like this one either, so don't waste your time watching it and then complain about it on this website.b. If you liked the first movie, you'll probably enjoy this one as well, so go ahead and enjoy it, no matter what the complainers say.c. If you haven't seen the first movie, watch it first, because it's a good movie and gives you the background on the story. Then watch this movie.",0
"It's not funny at all, it's got a story stringed together, and the acting isn't even all that good.It's just bad, watch something else.",0
"Holy crap, I hope so, because I can't stand to watch another one of these horrible films. Let me start off with my grisly story of how I watched this film. I got it as a Christmas present from a family member. She said I knew I liked the first one, which she was wrong, so she went ahead and got me the sequel. I made a fake smile, and before I put it away for life, she suggested we watched it. My heart was pounding out of my chest, for I knew I could not escape! I hated the first one and even though I am willing to give any film a chance, I was not anywhere near excited.Well, we started it up, and pretty soon we were all sitting down watching it. Here's a clue as to what my families thoughts on it were: The family member apologized for buying it for me, my brother fell asleep, and my mom sat there with a disgusted look on her face. Even my eight year old cousin and five year old nephew did not laugh! I still can not believe that this is the filth that caused the wonderful movie Grindhouse to bomb, and I will hate this film until the very day I die for that, and I feel tremendously sorry for anyone who decides to watch it. It's just as poor as everything is in the first. Lame jokes, lame acting and lame plot.If another film is made I assume it will be titled, ""We're Not Done Yet, Sorry"".",0
"Are We Done Yet is a very good sequel, even better than the first. I don't know why there is all the negative hype, but viewers should ignore the reviews. This film starts of with Nick and Suzanne, newly married, living in Nick's apartment with their kids. They decide it's too small, so they move to the country. They find a house to their liking, not knowing it's a broken-down piece of crap. After the house falls apart, the Persons hire a contractor. Can he help make the lives of the Persons get any easier? You will just have to find out. First of all, the acting is great. All the original cast is excellent. The new members of the cast was just as great, especially the contractor(the funny John C. McGinley). What surprised me was the score of the film. I thought there would only be rap with a few classical notes, but there is only a few rap songs. Overall, this is a family film that I recommend. I rate this film a 9/10.",0
"I went to see this with a good friend over the weekend b/c I had nothing to do and she really liked Are We There Yet? and convinced me that this would be funny. Please, I urge you not to see this movie if you are over the age of 8. This was an hour and a half of my life that I will NEVER get back.**SPOILERS (I guess)**I'm thinking the makers of this ""movie"" just ripped off and pieced together parts of other bad movies like The Money Pit, The Great Outdoors, Troop Beverly Hills.... or any of those family films where the new stepparent or annoying relative is trying to win over the kids/other relatives and a bunch of wacky adventures (in the wilderness, on the road, with a crappy house, with a rebellious teen, etc) ensue. Nothing in this movie is wacky or funny. Seriously, there are jokes like ""I don't know karate, but I know Ka-razy"" and a wife giving birth going ""You did this to me! I hate you!"" Nope, never heard those before. Then, there is everyone blaming our hero, Ice Cube, for all of the terrible things going wrong, when either: a) they are the fault of the bafflingly annoying con-artist/psychopath that serves as their realtor, contractor, house inspector, electrician, connection to Magic Johnson, midwife (yes, midwife) and ""baby whisperer"" (don't ask).b) no one really seems to care that the 13 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER is either prancing around in next to nothing or going to a huge party with (I assume) a lot of alcohol and a guy who looks like he's probably 18 or older (Hello, statutory rape, anyone?). The mother is completely unconcerned and/or chooses not to get involved. Instead, she lets a man who her kids barely know do the parenting. I could go on. There are so many things in this movie that don't make sense or are just plain dumb that I guess the producers thought would be funny. They were very, very wrong. This movie bites.",0
"I've never seen Are We There Yet?, and I had no intention of watching this film. I thought as many that the funny parts were in the trailers and that the actors were sub-par. For the most part that is true. There were some surprises in the humor, mostly from John C. McGinley, but it was far from side splitting. Even though it was not a great movie on the whole, it was a great family film. Today, with the exception of Disney, most movies are far from family friendly. Even Dreamwork's cartoons have a great deal of crude humor in them that make most parents cringe when watching them with small children. Are We Done Yet? actually has a lot of great family values that are missing from a lot of movies that have come out recently. The film shows a man who is forced to take care of a family that is not his own and also to prepare for his future children with his new wife. This step-father acts more like a dad should to his teenage step-daughter than most real father's do. Very rarely will you see some one in a film telling a young girl to put on more clothes and yelling at her for sneaking out of the house. If you are looking for something that is more than okay to watch with the kids then this is a movie to check out. Don't expect anything close to award winning, but parents can watch this safely with their kids without wondering if their kids know what the last innuendo meant every couple of minutes.",0
"Of all the Ice Cube movies I have seen, this has got to be the worst. Not only were many of results cliché, especially the ending, but many of the characters were just unfunny. And that is being nice.John McGinley, who initially seems welcoming, becomes a nuisance. He sells Ice a lemon of a home and has a monopoly on every main job for the community. But instead of getting rid of him, he becomes liked. Even Ice Cube likes him at the end.Many of the jokes were bad or badly set up. I admit blind plumbers could have been funny. But instead, they just walked about with stereotypical blind sticks. But nothing funny happened. Nothing. How could anybody blow a bit like that? Apparently this crew could.Ice Cube could have done worse. But I am not happy with his work. Nia Long is very nice looking, but the plot, direction, and screenplay is all wrong. Better luck making ""Next Next Friday"" or ""Barbershop 3"". They probably would be better. ""D""",0
"I'll be the first to admit that 'Are We There Yet?' is pretty atrocious. In fact, thinking about it, I have to wonder why I even wanted to see 'Are We Done Yet?' when its predecessor was so awful.To my surprise, this turned out to be one of the most entertaining family movies I have seen in a long time. Admitedly, I don't go and see too many, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much fun this movie was. I find it incredible that this film is, as of this writing, number 29 in the list of worst films ever on IMDb. That said, 'V for Vendetta' (one of the worst films ever made, in my opinion) is in the top 250, so what does it really mean? What astounds me is that 'Are We There Yet?' is better rated than its sequel, which outdoes it in almost every way. Don't get me wrong, this is not Tarkovsky. It's stupid and childish and essentially pointless, but guess what - that's the point, it's a family film. Taken in this context, it is a more than passable way to spend 100 minutes of your time.Ice Cube, who looked and felt a little out of place in the first film, has eased into this character nicely and has really developed some fine comic timing. To be able to go from ""the nigga you love to hate"" to a genuinely amusing turn in a family comedy is not something many people could do with any degree of success, but Cube pulls it off.The kids are less annoying than they were in the first film, but the writers have again failed to give the audience any reason to like them, even a little. Consequently, the most unfeasible thing about Cube's character is that he hasn't murdered them yet. What the writers have managed to do here is give Nia Long a bit more to work with. In 'Are We There Yet?' it was hard to imagine what Cube's character saw in her (aside from the obvious) but she's actually a lot more endearing here, and she looks divine.The real surprise was John C McGinley, whom I expected to suck royally. While he's not known for comedy and has made some ropey choices over the years (notable exceptions being 'Platoon', 'Point Break' and 'Seven'), he almost makes this film. His character is ridiculous, and the biggest mistake he and the director could have made would have been to try and ground the character in any sort of reality. Thankfully they didn't, and McGinley consequently provides some of the best moments in the movie. The twist in the character's back story actually manages to be quite moving too.All things considered, its hard to fault a film that is under no pretence about its intentions. This is nothing more or less than good family fun. The fact that it is also well paced, well designed and has fantastic music supervision only adds to my admiration.If you go to see this film for the right reason, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised (I urge you not to be put off by its predecessor). If you go into it looking for a reason to bad-mouth it, I have one thing to say to you; Get a life, it's a frigging family film!",0
"What a Shocker, the film should have been renamed Can i go home yet because i wanted to from 10 minutes in.I have never been so bored watching a film, it was almost painful to watch, lets see where it all went wrong.Are we there yet, This was hilarious and this was due to a couple of key areas. 1) The story revolved around the kids and they made all the moments of laughter. 2) The Beloved Car 3) Satchel Paige sitting on the car dashboard.Now lets see where ""Are we Done yet"" went wrong.The kids were hardly in the movie compared to the original, The car was hardly seen and Satch was not even in the movie. Add to that the most annoying character in the history of cinema played by John C. McGinley and we have a turkey of a movie roasting to perfection. It breaks my heart to say this as i have seen, Are we there yet like 20 times and it still has me in fits of laughter, my 2 year old nephew wants to always watch it and i am more than happy to. They should have called this Home Improvement as the whole story revolved around McGinley's character. it was also embarrassing the way the movie tried to cling to successful scenes from the original movie, Aleisha Allen singing and the scene with the rabid Deer.In conclusion i am sorry to say that this film is another poor excuse this summer on a bandwagon of shocking Sequels.",0
"I hope they are done and this is the last sequel to this franchise. This time Nick is moving his family to the suburbs. They get duped into buying a house that is falling apart and then hire an extremely eccentric contractor to fix it up. And as you would expect in movies like this, mishaps follow. There is a raccoon on the roof that won't go away, bats come through the chimney, the whole floor gets torn up, etc...But Nick comes around and takes Kevin fishing, in what is perhaps the silliest part of the film with the cgi giant catfish. But Chuck the contractor is extremely annoying and I can't believe even the wife would think he is great after he sells them a torn up house and tears it up himself fixing it. But since this is a kids film, you know Nick will learn the value of family in the end.FINAL VERDICT: It's for kids. 10 year olds will probably like it.",0
"Are We There Yet was no great shakes but it had its moments. This film however has very few redeeming qualities at all, and was really a chore to sit through. In fact I was checking the clock before the halfway mark as it was very dull and very slack in pace. Not only that but it was further disadvantaged by a truly dreadful script that is never funny or poignant, a predictable story, unfunny gags and situations and terrible acting(Ice Cube tries hard but is badly let down by the script and his co-stars). The direction is non-existent and the last half especially is sloppy in the extreme. Overall, awful film and not recommended. 1/10 Bethany Cox",0
"The film takes place about a year after the events from Are We There Yet(2005), and Nick(Ice Cube) and Suzanne(Nia Long) get married and live in his apartment with the kids, and sells his store in hopes to becomes a magazine writer. But Suzanne announces that she is pregnant, and Nick soon realizes that his apartment is no place for a family, so they move, much of the dismay of the kids, out to the beautiful side of the country. They end up buying a house, but the house is very old, and it begins to fall apart(anybody remember The Money Pit?). So they call on Chuck Mitchell Jr(John C. McGinley), a contractor who in hopes to help fix up the place, and that Murphy's Law does not take part. I enjoyed Are We There Yet, but the second time around just didn't quite do it. Although moments with Ice Cube and John C. McGinley playing off each other were pretty funny, but the rest of the film to me, appeared to be that was trying to hard to be funnier then the first, but it just didn't do it. It ends up looking like one Bad SNL joke after another.",0
"so finally I'm writing my first review because i think something is wrong here i have just watched this movie with my 7 years old boy and guess what? we both enjoyed it, in fact ,i watched it twice ! its fun, fresh, and no sex scenes or swearing ! so its definitely a family movie so why those HATERS underrated this movie and overrated movies like ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" o and some of my favourite films are : 12 angry men,the rear window , all spaghetti movies collection,the machinist, godfather 2, and many more , and now ""ARE WE DONE YET "" is one of them , remember cinema is also about entertainment , a good picture, and a laugh, so i will give this movie 8",0
"I can't understand why this movie would make the bottom 100 movies on IMDb at #11. There have been far worse movies than this. I question a lot of time on how people rate movies on this website. This the kind of movie that isn't expected to have a great plot! It's family movie that should be a fun outing and it sure looks like it would be to me and I'm 19 yrs. old! I enjoyed the first movie and I wanted to see the second one but never got the chance to. i'll definitely be seeing it when it comes out on DVD. It's mindless fun that you can turn your brain off and enjoy. Night at the Museum didn't have a fabulous plot line but if you turned off your brain, it was an enjoyable movie. People, just give movies like this a chance and have fun! I think a lot of people don't understand whatt family fun means anymore...I'm looking forward to enjoying it :)",0
"This film focuses this time on Ice Cube and John C. McGinley as the main leads of the film.Yes, the other cast do star, however these are the central characters.John C. McGinley is the annoying character in the film seen as evil by Ice Cube and lovely and adorable by the other cast.NOW you can see thats going to cause problems when your stepfather and your wife's going to have twins. Not only that you have bought the ultimate house of horrors, which reminds me of Tom Hanks's movie MONEY PIT.I really like John C. McGinley as an actor but he annoyed me. Ice cube has made a movie for moral value and good attempt at a family comedy. It does not live up to the original as the movie is now shared by two stars and the movie does begin to slow down. For attempt and some good sequences 5.Notice Taj Mowhry in this film, yeah he looks different but not that much that I could not recognise him.",0
"Nick (Ice Cube) has married his beautiful gal, Suzanne (Nia Long), from the film Are We There Yet. Along with her two conniving but lovable children, Lindsey and Kevin, the couple is living in Nick's smallish apartment in Portland, Oregon. As Nick has sold his sports collectibles store and is trying to launch a new magazine, the lack of space is giving him fits. Then, Suzanne drops a bomb, too...she's pregnant. Needing a larger living space as soon as possible, the family goes into the woods of northern Oregon and finds a lovely home, with five bedrooms and charm in abundance. Despite the kids not wanting to leave their friends, the family makes the move. But, shortly after, their dream house has an electrical problem. The realtor who sold them the house (Ted McGinley) turns out to be the area's contractor as well. As more problems emerge for the house, Nick begins to think he has purchased a money pit and he becomes very cranky. He alienates Suzanne, the kids, and the entire village. Will there be a happy ending? This is a fine sequel to the first film and is loosely based on that old classic, Mr. Blanding Builds His Dream House. Ice Cube is really terrific as the much put-upon dad of the family, generating the film's biggest laughs with his expressions and antics. Long is lovely and the two children are quite nice as the supporting players. McGinley is pretty much of a hoot, too, as the goofball realtor/contractor/midwife! The scenery is gorgeous, the costumes well selected and the look of the film is very fine indeed. Although the fixer-upper-turned-nightmare theme is nothing new, it still can be presented in a fresh way, as it is here. Most important, this is a good and humorous film for the entire family, with much to say about parents and children sticking together when the going gets tough. Are you and your loved ones feeling down today? Go get this film and turn everyone's day around.",0
"Ice Cubes career maybe done with another movie like this, poor sequel to ARe We There Yet? Done is a remake of Mr Blandings Builds His Dream House. The earlier film had Cary Grant and some very good jokes coming from the pain of renovating an old home. Done is full of stupid jokes (some of which are funny-but not enough) stupid characters and poor direction and writing.Who did they make this movie for? As much as I disliked the kids in the first film (the reason I disliked that movie) there was something that made it work if you could get past the brats.This is just poor wishful thinking The best thing to do when asked ""Are We Done Yet? is simply not to start",0
"We had free passes that were coming up for their date of use so we took a stroll to the theater to watch a family ""G"" rated movie. Unfortunately, it was the only one available (sadly, Shrek III was opening the next day...) so we went for it.You know what, i was expecting a awful movie but i ended up finding it to be fair. But in a family perspective. The acting for the young and adult actors is way under the average and the characters are so naive, sometimes it hurts !5/10 for its family values, the scene with the owl (which i found the funniest) but the lack of continuous laughter.Again, to be enjoyed with the company of for 6 to 10 year old kids.",0
"I admit, I didn't see this film in the theater. I caught the first one (Are We There Yet) on cable and disliked it enough that I refused to see the sequel. However, flipping through the channels one day, I caught a couple of scenes of ""Are We Done Yet"" and frankly, I found myself laughing more than once. It was surprisingly enjoyable. John McGinley was brilliant, Ice Cube made me chuckle every time something went wrong. He was so likable even when he was the most frustrated. It was a lighthearted family film, that given the chance, rendered some bonafide giggles. This movie didn't deserve a 2.8. I'd easily give it a 6.",0
"I thought it was really funny. Me, my brother and my sister-in-law watched this, i personally thought it was very good. Not as good as the first one though. I thought one of the funny parts (that stuck with me) was when there was a possum on his roof and he was trying to get it off, and it so funny because the possum just stairs at him after he falls through his house's roof ... his face is price-less :)I have given it a 7/10 basing on its humour and very funny story lines.i recommend it to anyone who found the first one funny - or wants a laugh!",0
"Personally, I loved this movie. Everything about it, really. John C. McGinley (Scrubs, Platoon, Intensity) was fantastic in this movie....can't say as much for the other actors, though they were still good.This one opinion applauding it's greatness contrast to all of the diminishing comments before might seem like I'm just saying it out of pity or something of the sort, but I honest to God enjoyed the movie.Though I must admit, if it wasn't for Chuck Mitchel (McGinley), the movie would've been horrifyingly boring, but thankfully, Chuck was a good enough character with a good enough actor to at least let the movie be able to stand on it's own two feet.But to sum it up, it's a great family film that parents will enjoy watching with their kids, and yes, dare I say it, it's way better than the first one, Are We There Yet?. I hope this helped some! ^_^",0
"It was amazing, that such crap could be made and anyone could give it higher than a 1!The entire movie, it seems like ice cubes only line is I can fix that! The entire movie i felt like saying are we done yet? I was NEVER entertained and didn't laugh ONCE! When i went there with some friends, private movie, second day. WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU? Absolute crap. A torn down house and a man is trying to sell it. nothing interesting. So boring in fact, halfway through the movie i went to a corner and played with Ribiks cube. We left 30 minates before it was over, and went bowling instead. Do not buy this on DVD! (unless your suisideal.)Deserves the bottom spot in the bottom 100.",0
"When will the entertainment industry learn to stop remaking successful (or even unsuccessful) classics? Can't anyone come up with something new or original, or even a decent twist to an already existing storyline? I think the whole Fish Out of Water concept did not work at all with this movie, what with the City Folks moving to the country and all the horrible things, like bats, there for some slapstick comedy to add some action to the movie. Note to whoever paid to have this movie made: It did not work. And the entire premise that a ""smart"" business person who obviously is spending a lot of money to buy a house on a large parcel of land would choose to not pay to have the house inspected, well, what can one say about this concept, other that it tells the audience that the rest of the movie is going to just get worse? Not that this movie was all that close to the original it was trying to copy, since the house was already built. The house just needed a lot of work to make it habitable, and thus our plot of the hapless and idiotic father who slams his thumb with a hammer, falls through roofs, has a run-in with electricity, and of course, the weird, but has a heart of gold, contractor. And then there is the scene where our main character is out showing his step-kids nature and they come across a deer. Everyone, including the deer, are scared and go running off, screaming the entire time. Same as the audience would be my guess.",0

As the title suggests, this is an origin story that sets up the demigod character. Despised by his father King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins) since the day he was born, Hercules - the son of Zeus and Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee) - is sent to war after failing to elope with his true love, Princess Hebe (Gaia Weiss). King Amphitryon favors his elder son, Iphicles (Liam Garrigan); unfortunately he is not warrior material let alone lead a kingdom and winning the heart of Princess Hebe. As fate would have it, Hercules survived the war and returns to reclaim his love and kingdom from the wrath of King Amphitryon. The poster reads From the director of Cliffhanger and Die Hard 2 - it's unfortunate they forgot to add in the fact that both were movies from more than twenty years ago, and Renny Harlin's directing career has long been sunk by a certain Cutthroat Island. Let's face it; The Legend of Hercules isn't going to resurrect Harlin's status in Hollywood anytime soon. While similarly themed movies such as 300, Immortals and Clash of the Titans are known more for their visual aesthetics than storytelling, The Legend of Hercules failed miserably on both accounts. Filmed entirely in Eastern Europe because of cheaper costs and taxes, Harlin's movie mimics the feel and look of its predecessors while pretending to strip down to the grittiness of that era. However every single set piece looks like a cheap knock-off, right down to the CG extensions - case in point, one seriously fake looking puppeteer lion looks even worse than that in cable series Spartacus and Rome.Written by at least four credited writers (one of them from the terrible Conan the Barbarian remake and Harlin himself), it is such a shame that the supposedly mythology-inspired story instead resembles Ridley Scott's Gladiator more than anything - if you recall, Maximus, was also betrayed and sold to slavery but made a comeback for revenge. We didn't realize that the legendary Greek hero Hercules actually ventures on the same path until now.Unimaginative plotting aside, the movie suffers from incredible clunky, modernized dialogue peppered with a variety of British and American accents and awful delivery from the actors. With the exception of McKee and Adkins (surprisingly turning in a solid performance), most of the cast members - especially Lutz - needs to sign up for advanced acting classes. Minus off all the disemboweling, limb and head severing and bloodshed you normally would have expect from such a theme (an obvious attempt to lure in younger audiences), The Legend of Hercules quickly dissolves into a predictable yawn fest.It's a tad disappointing that a movie about a demigod with incredible strength fares without emotion and plays like generally a mere paint-by- number adventure. Comparing to the 1997 animated feature by Disney, this one is hardly worth the time.",0
"Let me start off by saying I am a huge fantasy fan. I can usually enjoy any swords and sorcery type film and find something good about it. Now let me say Wow this movie was bad. I mean I thought this kind of clumsy, lowest common denominator filmmaking died in the 80's. It is bad when I asked the organizer to give me a refund on a free prescreening.Where to begin? I don't expect much in this type of movie in terms of plot or characterization. In action ""porn"" like this, the plot is usually just barely coherent enough to move from one action sequence to the next and the characters are as black and white as a chessboard. This movie somehow delivers LESS than that.It is staggering to me that with a mythology as rich and engaging to draw from, they choose a tired rehashing of Gladiator as the main focus of the film. No doubt holding the more interesting material back for future sequels. The laughable love story is unengaging, poorly scripted and given far too much screen time.What really disappoints is the action sequences. Hercules is supposed to be a demigod that achieves the impossible; the movie portrays none of this. It wastes a good deal of time with a clumsy mix of fighting scenes in which Hercules is repeatedly captured and/or defeated. WTF? It is only towards the end that an attempt is made to show Hercules as he should be seen, but I had tuned out long before then. Oddly enough, the blood and gore in this film is kept to a minimum, probably to keep it at PG-13 in hopes of duping the largest possible audience to drop money on it. It would have really benefited from a Conan-esque level of violence to give the movie more weight and better directed action sequences. The dramatic pause in the middle of the action (made famous in the movie 300) is in every single action sequence. I really don't know what I recommend from this film. Everything in the movie has been done better in other films. I hope this film tanks but I doubt it. It will make a profit and encourage more of the same I'm sure.",0
"Not the worst of anything to do with the Hercules legend, there are a few obscure low budget animated adaptations (not feature length) that are marginally worse. When it comes to feature length films, it would be very difficult to think of a worse depiction of Hercules than 'The Legend of Hercules'.The sole saving grace is Liam McIntyre. He is the only actor who tries and the only one to feel right for his character and within the tone of the story. However the rest of the acting was just diabolical. Kellan Lutz has to be one of the most charisma-free and can't-act-his-way-out-a-paper-bag actors working today, he brings none of the heroism and conflict of this great charismatic hero and spends all his screen time looking blank and wooden and uttering his admittedly terrible lines with the flattest and most awkward line delivery imaginable.Can't say anything better about the ladies either, who also show their acting limitations, especially the portrayal of Hebe who is in dire need of an acting coach. The obligatory villain acting is so pantomimic and overdone that one's surprised at how there was any scenery left from all the chewing, and it is so cartoonish that it veers on at times unintentionally comical rather than menacing.Blame cannot be entirely laid at their door though. 'The Legend of Hercules' is very incompetently directed by a director that in the film's worst parts even makes Uwe Ball look good. Even worse is the script, which is extremely flabby and heavy in banality and melodrama. The characters are genre stereotypes basically and have the development of a thin piece of cardboard. The story, what there is of it (for the running time this is often wafer-thin and threadbare storytelling) rushes from one scene and plot point to another, and jumps around constantly that following what's going on is not always easy. But because the writing and characterisation has so little to them and that thrills, emotional engagement and such are next to none the film feels interminably dull and lifeless often.Some bad fantasy-action-adventure films have the credit of looking good. That cannot be said at all for 'The Legend of Hercules' that looks like direct to video fodder from SyFy or The Asylum. The photography is unfocused and editing choppy, with an irritating over-reliance of slow motion and impregnated pauses that come over often as gimmicky, excessive and unnecessary. The sets and costumes look recycled, and to say that the special effects are dodgy is not just an understatement but actually pretty insulting, some of the worst effects of any film seen in recent years.What little there is of the action is at best uninspired choreographically, an eyesore visually and in terms of peril they're somewhat tame. The music score is lifeless and forgettable, very generic genre scoring actually. The 50s and 60s Hercules films may have been cheap and cheesy, but at least they knew what their goals were, who they were aiming at and what tone to take. 'The Legend of Hercules' fails at all three of those things, often it was difficult to work out what it was trying to be or what tone it was aiming for as it tries to be light-hearted fun and also take it seriously and fails abysmally at both.To summarise, very bad film. How it made it to theatres/cinemas and not straight to DVD is honestly a complete enigma to me, and this is coming from a very subjective person when expressing opinions. 2/10 Bethany Cox",0
"Absolutely Average and Below in Every Way, this by the Numbers Filmmaking from a Very Inconsistent Director is so Unremarkable that it Barely Exists and is in Danger of Fading from Memory So Fast that the Mythology of Hercules is Safe.This is Not Awful, Not Good, Not Much of Anything. It just Sort of Lies there with Nothing to Say, Attract Attention or be Concerned About. The Acting is Across the Board Boring. The Story is Unfaithful to its Source Material and the Story being Told is so Familiar and Stale that even Youngsters will be Disappointed.It is Disposable and Dull with that Old PG-13 Curse of Banality and Yawn Inducing Action Scenes (that are worse when dealing with swords, spears, and Gladiator type mayhem) that the Battles are Rendered War Weary from the Outset. Overall, Not the Worst Thing ever, but if You are Going to Watch it, do it Soon before it Ceases to Exist like the Pools of Sweat from a Strenuous Workout.",0
"The Legend of Hercules is one of two Hercules movies in 2014, the other one is set for release in July starring Dwayne Johnson and Directed by Brett Ratner. And I gotta say, after seeing this movie, I'm really looking forward to the Brett Ratner version, and that's saying something. Where do I begin? The acting is hilariously awful (Kellan Lutz and the villains especially). The romance is laughable. The fight scenes are a total rip off of 300 and Gladiator, with obnoxious slow-mo being used every 10 seconds. And for a movie with a budget of $70 million, it looks cheap.The Legend of Hercules has some of the worst production values I've ever seen in a film. The costumes look noticeably cheap, The props are low rent, The green screen effects are amateurish. The 3D conversion is even worse. And the CGI looks worse than an Asylum movie.Final Verdict: Unless you're watching for a cheap laugh, you should avoid this stinker like the plague.",0
"The Legend of Hercules is a film directed by Renny Harlin, and stars Kellan Lutz, Scott Adkins and Gaia Weiss, and revolves around the character of Hercules, son of Zeus, who was born solely to end the life of the King of his people, and unite the lands in peace, or something like that. I didn't pay too much attention, to be honest! This movie is horrible. It's clichéd to pieces, poorly directed, horribly acted and disastrously written. All the dialogue feels so god damned forced, and makes it incredibly difficult to latch onto any of the characters. Whenever they speak... It's like someone saw Spartacus or Game of Thrones and went ""Well, now I certainly know how people of that era spoke!"" and wrote a screenplay, full of fancy words and shallow speeches. You don't feel like a single word here is sincere; from Hercules speaking to his clichéd, forbidden love Hebe (Yeah, that's right; his forbidden love's name is Princess Hebe), and from the King to his son... It's all atrocious! The screenwriter also saw the speeches in Braveheart and LOTR: Return of The King and went ""Well, we obviously need a battle speech!"" and wrote a bunch of big speeches that were emotionless, and couldn't have been more forced. I'll move on, cause I could go on about the dialogue for days! The acting... It's too much! The main actor, Kellan Lutz, came from Twilight... So you knew from the beginning you were in for a bad ride. He's completely emotionless, stale and you not for one second care for his character. His forbidden love, played by Gaia Weiss, is equally horrible! The only reason she was cast, obviously, is because she's pretty damned hot! Scott Adkins, though, leads the way in crappy performances! His entire performance revolves around him yelling every single word. He could be speaking to his wife in private, and still find the need to yell every word to her. It was dreadful to watch! The only decent performance was delivered by Liam McIntyre, who plays Hercules's friend and comrade. He could actually deliver the lines with a bit of power, emotion! Despite his decent performance though, the rest of the cast deserves Razzie's. I'm calling it people; every single actor and actress here will get nominated at the Golden Raspberries this year! That is not good!The action is horrendous. Remember 300; that badass film about Spartan's kicking a bunch of Persian's asses? And remember how it used to go into awesome slow motion every once in a while during the fighting, when a sword was plunged deep into a body, or someone hit another over the head? Well, they do it here! And is it good? Hell no! They overuse it to pieces, and by the end of the film, you can't help but cringe every time it occurs. The action in general feels weak. There is never a moment in this film in which you worry for Hercules. You always know that he's going to beat his opponents, and that makes for fights that have you bored and uninterested! When the great hero Hercules lacks peril in his fight scenes, you have a problem. The CGI here is again, horrible! All the green screen looks like it could have fit right into a 1980's action flick. For a film coming out in 2014, that's not a good sign! All the CGI aspects of this film look incredibly fake, and mixed in with the terrible live sets, it makes for a difficult experience. I'm so thankful I did not see this in 3D, I certainly wouldn't have been able to stand it all. And the extra admission price... completely criminal!Overall, The Legend of Hercules is a pile of crap. Just please don't watch this! This film should be nominated for Razzie's, and make a minimal amount at the box office. It's one of the worst movies of all time, and certainly going to be on my top 10 worst of 2014. I need to watch 300 now, to feel good about this genre again. 1.1/10Find more film reviews at www.entjunkie.blogspot.com",0
The Legend of Hercules spoiler free reviewThis movie is HORRIBLE. Where do i start. The acting is just laughable and bad. Kellan Lutz is bad as Hercules (Hopefully Dwayne Johnson will do better in the next Hercules movie). Every line is said horribly. Did i mention the dialogue is BAD.The script is horrible. It has nothing to do with the original mythology. It tries to be like 300 and Gladiator but fails horribly. The romance is so cheesy with the worst romance dialogue i have ever heard.Are the action scenes good?....No....Far from good. It always uses slow motion just like 300 (which was used better) but it was obnoxious and gets old and annoying. The visual effects and green screen is horrible and this movie has a budget of over 70 million dollars!!! What?! Movies with lower budgets look more convincing then this. Overall rating 1/10 One of the worst movies i have seen all year and we're still in January!!! Hopefully the Brett Ratner version is better and obviously it will be. You can't get lower than this.,0
"This movie lost me even before I was dragged into the theater. The trailers made it look like a movie made mostly for the sake of violence and for showcasing the sweaty, hairless, shirtless bodies of the male actors; there is plenty if the latter, but shockingly less than expected of the former so if you're interested in bloody and graphic violence skip it, there's nothing that graphic to speak of. The story of Hercules's impossible tasks, is abandoned (and only makes a cameo in a scene where he kills a lion) and instead it's been replaced with a meathead's view of Ridley Scott's, Gladiator. The story and characters are as shallow as kiddie pools, the editing never slows down the pace which is tiring after the first twenty minutes, the same establishing shots are used in the very first shot of every scene, the music also doesn't know how to tone down, as that the climax of each scene is accompanied with large, ""rousing"" crescendo, the writing is awful and gives you no look into the mind of the characters (at least I hope they had more going on in their heads than what was expressed), there is no acting to speak of, and the visual effects look like they're from a Sci-Fi Channel movie. To add to my disappointment, I also discovered that IMDb doesn't have a ""0 star"" rating, what the hell?",0
"It is absolutely shocking that this movie came out in today's market. The dialog was horrible: cliché and predictable. The entire film was, in fact, predictable. We saw the previews, we went to the film, and about ten minutes in we knew it was bad. We gave it a chance, hoping it would get better, that it would redeem itself in some way. It did not. It got worse. If you are just looking for an entertaining film, this is a major disappointment, to say the least. Obvious special effects, slow motion for every other move in every fight scene, and terrible, I mean tragic, dialog. If you are a fan of Greek mythology, it's downright offensive. Don't waste your time or your money.",0
"I go into every movie with an open mind and yet that couldn't help me enjoy this whatsoever. Kellan Lutz can't carry a movie on his own, then again, no one could've carried this movie.From the opening dialogue ""I accept your challenge, prepare to die!"" you know you've got a long movie ahead of you. Oh and the fight scenes...not sure if they were trying to be ""The Matrix"" or ""300"" with all of the slow motion it used, but it didn't work. The fight scenes would've been better had it been shown full speed.Then there's the love triangle and the 3 actors involved were all equally terrible. In one scene after Hercules returns and the girl sees him for the first time after she thought he was dead, they lay in the woods and it's just awkward.The CGI may be the worst of the 21st Century. It's like they didn't even try to make it look real. It felt like one of those SciFy B horror movies you watch...I take it back, it was worse than that. And at a running time of only about 90 or so minutes, it felt like 3 hours and the fight scenes were the only bearable part of this movie. But even those get repetitive with all of the slow motion like I mentioned before.I can only hope that the next Hercules movie being released later this year will be better, and I'm not too worried that it will easily surpass this horrendous piece of work. I have no doubt this will be on my list of worst movies in the year of 2014.",0
"This is probably why we do not see many quality swords and sandals flicks, most Hollywood producers are worried about the ""badassness"" of the film rather than a quality experience. Unfortunately, the drawing rooms are most likely filled with ideas about actors in costume jumping in slow motion to attack the bad guy and other senseless special effects a la Transformers.I guess what I am saying is that newer technology and more special effects are not always a good thing, specially with a swords and sandals movie, Hollywood will continue losing money on movie tickets because they are missing the point, sometimes less is more.This movie really was awful, I hope The Rock's Thracian Wars will give us a more realistic feel of what a Hercules movie should be.",0
"Hercules is not entirely a disaster, as one might expect. A low-budget PG-13 adaptation of 300-style movies made in Bulgaria, this movie is in line with the expectations on what Renny Harlin is capable of.While not being a disaster on a whole, it's a disaster in parts. The special effects, while being descent 3D images at times, are badly connected with live shots. There are many moments when perspective of such sequences is distorted in really obvious (and unintentionally funny) ways. There are numerous anachronisms. Characters use costumes and jewelry that could not be available in ancient Greece. Screenplay, while not being completely absurd, has some rather awkward dialog lines and unexplainable plot moments.Unfortunately, the movie is not a Hercules legend but rather a shallow love story and family drama. There's even a bathing scene in a romantic- looking pond with flowers under a waterfall (the water in the pond is so dirty though that one can only feel pity for the actors). There are no heroic deeds of Hercules depicted in this movie.One last blow for Hercules is PG-13 rating. There's no blood at all. When swords pierce bodies, they re-appear absolutely clean. When one of the characters was struck in the neck, the next shot showed his neck without a sign of a would or even a drop of blood. One of the few things the movie managed to deliver were some dynamic battle sequences; but PG- 13 made them look fake. In the age of 300 and Spartacus TV show, this is not something you want to waste your time on.Unless you wish to add to a surprising $8 mln box office success after its first weekend, which will probably make this movie more profitable than most other current releases.",0
"In 1200 B.C. Greece, King Amphitryon conquers Argos by killing its ruler. Queen Alcmene is tired of his constant war. Hera allows her to have a baby with Zeus who would grow up to be the half-God champion Hercules (Kellan Lutz). He falls in love with Princess Hebe of Crete but his jealous older half-brother Iphicles announces his marriage to her. Hercules is sent to Egypt where he is set up for an ambush and sold into slavery.The opening fight is slightly interesting. It tries to be 300 but it's not as good. It starts out as a cheaper version of that style. That would be fine but it only gets worst from there. Kellan Lutz comes in and the muscle-bound dude is not charismatic enough to lead. The action style becomes cheaper and weaker. This Greek epic story has never seem less compelling.",0
"The only thing worse than this movie is having to watch it in 3D and have the awful come out of the screen at you. Horrible. The guy who plays Hercules should be arrested and tried in court for crimes against humanity. The actress who plays Hebe gave so many awkward moments in this film she should be sent to MTV to coach the 16 and pregnant girls how to lose their man. The fight scenes in this film start off alright; but gradually turn into WWE backyard wrestling. The scene near the beginning where Hercules fights the horrible CGI Lion was so horribly done that I almost walked out on the film then. Sadly, I decided to wait until much later to do that. I would add more to this review; but I was smart enough to actually leave and try to save the rest of the night with ice cream and though I should go to a crisis center. Sadly, they do not have a ""center for the people who just saw the worst film ever"". Do not see this movie; you have been warned.",0
"Nicely done Herc legend (about 2000X better than the Dwayne Johnson version) done by the incomparable and unpredictable Renny Harlin, starring (if you know your casting) Hercules and Spartacus both, with Scott Adkins in one of his only decent performances since Undefeated 2 and 3 --- and it gets a low rating? What were you expecting? Star Wars?Good entertainment, nice pacing, a fun way to spend a few hours on a rainy afternoon.And if you are bored you can run the name Renny Harlin through the IMDb database and find out why he deserves your respect",0
"This has to be one of the worst movies of the year. A lot of times a bad movie's saving grace is the special effects, but they were terrible in this. What was all the slo-mo about? From the very opening scene with cgi soldiers instead of real people to the horrible lion to Hercules swinging around 2 huge stones. All of it looked so fake. Another thing, a movie like this needs all the blood and gore and since this was pg-13 everything like that was not shown on screen. When someone put a knife in a chest, there wasn't blood squirting everywhere. Let's not forget how bad the acting was. I'm not sure whom was worse, Kellen or Gaia.FINAL VERDICT: Avoid at all costs.",0
"Oh boy. What a ride, so much greatness. Ed Wood would be proud.The Legend of Hercules. This caustic comedy doesn't start at the minute 0 of the movie. The movie in itself is just the tip of the iceberg, to fully understand all the implications and subtlety of this story you have to be familiar with the background. This is NOT an easy movie. Just like Citizen Kane it's a movie you need to DESERVE, as it will not give itself to you too easily.It all starts in a rocking chair next to a swimming-pool. Summer is shining, life is good, whiskey's on the rocks. Some old guy with sun glasses is on the phone, talking while playing Candy Crush.""I'm telling you, people want a gladiator movie. Just like Gladiator, something like that! (Sweet.) Just freaking do something like the series Spartacus, or Rome, I don't (Tasty!) give a damn. I want the script in one week. (Sugar crush.)""One week later 10 screenwriters come up with 10 different scripts. For a movie 10 times better, the guy in the rocking chair decides the movie will be a blend of the 10 scripts.He puts 70 million dollars on the table.The movie is now shot and it's kind of very bad, just how it was supposed to be. It doesn't matter anyway because people just have to go to the cinema once, it's alright if they don't like it and don't come a second time! HA!Worried, some guy calls the money-guy in the rocking chair.""-Hey, I've been thinking, we should use a famous name from the mythology in the title! It will bring more people!-Asklepios?-Eeeehhh, well to be honest I was thinking Hercules...-Oh, alright then.""And so The Legend Of Hercules was born. This movie is not a story, it's money invested and hope for a return. If you make a bad movie but you hit some landmarks: Hercules, mythology, gladiators, somewhat-famous actors, then you'll probably make money.You have to understand the true, deep nature of this movie. The Legend of Hercules is a cry for help, a poetry, a game-changer. The actual purpose of this movie is to impact the global industry, to make producers realize that, no, bad movies actually DON'T WORK, and they are not easy money.A simple, honest, gladiator movie with no fake big name like Hercules, with no fake romance, with just a guy fighting and living in the roman empire would have made more money. It is time to leave the path of using the same recipe over and over again. This is the one and only message this movie conveys, successfully.I hope you'll appreciate The Legend of Hercules as fully as I did.",0
"Honestly, I don't know what Hercules myth, they were going for, but this movie wasn't Hercules, in any sense of the world. Where were the Twelve Labors? Where's evil Hera? She's supposed to try to make Hercules life, a little hell with raging madness! I know the Heracles tale is one of the most adapted heroes for films, but this had to be one of the worst Hercules ever. It got nothing right with the source material. Directed by Renny Harlin, the movie couldn't even figure out, what to call its title, as it was formerly known as Hercules: The Legend Begins and Hercules 3D. Don't bother, reading up on the myths of Heracles, as this movie redirected you to a new story, where the evil King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins) has just invaded the land of Argos. Feeling in shame of war, Amphitryon's wife, Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKenna) ask Hera to get Zeus to rape her so that she would have a God-child that would over-thrown the evil King. First off, Hera whom supposed to be the Goddess of virtue women and marriage allow this to happen? Hera was known for her jealous and vengeful nature against Zeus's lovers and offspring. How on Mount Olympia did she allow this to happen? Anyways, after Zeus had his way with the Queen, a child was born and grew up to become Hercules (Kellan Lutz). Oops, my bad, He-Man. No, that isn't right, I meant Alcides. Kellan Lutz is so one-dimensional dull that it was painful to see him in this role. The man doesn't look like a damn like the Heracles in mythology. Where is the Nemean lion coat? They really misused that lion. Why is it, smiling? Anyways, Alcides is having a great life being in love with his incest sister, Hebe (Gaia Weiss) who somehow lose her God-like powers of youth. When she's force to marry, Alcides's brother, Iphicles (Liam Garrigan), with Alcidies's disagreement. Amphitryon is forced to sell Alcidies into slavery as a gladiator. Now, Alcides must find a way back to his homeland, and defeat this evil father. Yes, the movie is not only ripping off the slow motion unrealistic fighting styles clichés from 2006's 300, but also the whole plot of 2000's Gladiator. The movie doesn't even seem to know the difference between the Romans and the Greeks. There is little prove of that there were Gladiator type fights for entertainment in Ancient Greece. The 3D work is pretty bad. There were scenes, where my eyes hurt after watching it. One good example is the lake scene where little white dandelion pieces were flowing everywhere. The action scenes were alright, but I just can't take a movie that has a silly scene with Hercules waving a lightning bolt bullwhip, seriously. It felt so formula, like it was model after the God of Wars video games. The CGI background were pretty horrible. You can tell in some scenes that it was filmed in green screen. The movie has little to no sense of time. The queen and the king don't really aged in the film. They look like they haven't aged in the last 22 years. The production seem limited, it really did look like they re-used extras and props from Star's Network TV Series Spartacus: Blood and Sand. The movie lacks with the PG-13 rated as Hercules was always meant to be a pretty hardcore violence film. Overall: For all the modern Sword and Sandals films, it's probably one of the movies, I wouldn't check out, until last. It's one of those movies, you really can't stand seriously. It's so bad, it's might be good, depending on what you deem as fun. For me, the Legend of Hercules is a punishment straight from Hades. For a movie about Hercules; I have to say, there are other films that might be better than this. Go see 2014's Hercules with Dwayne Johnson. If not go find Kevin Sorbo's Hercules: The Legendary Journeys (1995–1999) television show. Even Disney 1997's Hercules that had little to do with the main story was better than this. Still, this movie is a lot better than 1959's Hercules Unchained, 1983's Hercules and others. Why can't Hollywood ever take a story that works and make it compelling without dumbing it down, getting it mostly wrong and totally missing the point? I'm still waiting for a good Hercules movie. In my opinion, this movie wasn't the one, I was looking for.",0
"This isn't Gladiator and this isn't Spartacus either (whaever Spartacus you're thinking about ... it's not)! And we also have to say, it isn't Hercules either. Well not really, apart from the name in the title. But this takes liberties in story telling and it also does takes liberties towards the end, with a scene that is almost ridiculous, but also insanely funny.So while Kellan Lutz cannot even remotely be as amazing a Hercules as Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson is (will be, haven't watched the ""real"" Hercules movie yet), this can be fun to watch. The movie never pretends to be more than it actually is. But if you're not down with that, you might as well just skip this. It can be a fun party movie with some friends though ...",0
"This wasn't a terrible movie, I kind of enjoyed it. It's like a mixture of 300 and gladiator. I don't get all the bad reviews. If you like a good action flick I would say watch this.",0
"Read the bad reviews first, then watch this movie with modest expectations and its a good and quite absorbing action flick. Probably modelled on Gladiator, there's little to really conjure up the age of gods and heroes, or the particular legend of Hercules itself, but if you accept that this isn't art or mythic fidelity then you'll have a good time. Oh and one other thing, towards the end Hercules become He Man, Master of the Universe, complete with sword of power. Fortunately for Rene Harlin, he can't be accused of pilfering everything, for in this version Hercules/He-man kills Thundercat, also known as the Nemean lion, right at the beginning of the movie, which is a shame, because as a result he has to go everywhere by foot, or use a horse. The horse doesn't even have wings.As for the labours of Hercules, well there's another movie coming up with Dwayne Johnson, maybe they ended up thereVoted up to repair the low score",0
"The most serious fault is the weak story which apart from killing a lion and a brief impregnation by Zeus seems to have little to do with the Hercules legend. Instead of concentrating on his special strength and the tasks, it turned into a Spartacus like fighting movie. At least it wasn't sickening violence - just too much fighting. The love triangle with the brother feels forced. So is the liberation of Argos. Hercules isn't supposed to lead some army to free a city. I understand if they didn't want to just rehash all the mythology stories but this ill fitting incongruous story is bad.The female romantic lead wasn't pretty enough for the role. That made it feel B grade. Kellan himself can't act as well as Chris Hemsworth but he's okay for the role in terms of looking the part - it's not Shakespeare after all. His big speech at the end is awkward. Acting shouldn't be the thing in this type of movie but they could have done with a few bigger names in supporting roles to add some weight.If you lower your expectations a lot and don't think of the mythology at all to you might have a slightly diverting time watching an action movie set in ancient times. The grand CGI backdrops are moderately watchable. At least it doesn't pretend to be a great movie - so it wasn't as annoying as Wrath of the Titans with it's even more idiotic story.",0
"Omg, where to start. So I received a free screening of this movie and I have to admit I was very excited. Like usual they dude a superb job on the trailer that had you sitting on pins and needles waiting for a chance to catch a glimpse of this movie, what a waste. First off we all know the story of Hercules so there really isn't a chance of spoiling it. Some guy finds out he's the son of Zeus and uses his power of strength to save people. I get that. But the graphics in this movie, which are mediocre at best, are the only thing going for this film. I was so displeased that I chose to leave after an hour of watching and went home to get some sleep instead. I felt like I was staying up late at night watching movies that come on the SciFi channel that have a really cheap budget except this one had a bigger budget and a really bad script. Not to mention the chemistry between the actors was so awkward. I think soap opera members could do a better job. All and all I would give this movie a rating of 2. Not worth paying to go see or even driving to the theater to see a free screening. Maybe if it's online or comes on TV it might be worth your time if you have nothing else to do or you're babysitting and want the kids to fall asleep really quick.",0
"Finnish director Renny Harlin continues to disgrace himself with this ultra-cheesy version of the Greek story which is frankly an embarrassment and stain on the career of all involved. THE LEGEND OF HERCULES is one of three similarly-themed films that came out around the same time; one is a B-movie with Sean Astin and the other a Hollywood blockbuster with Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. The other two will need to be pretty bad to equal the poor quality of this one.THE LEGEND OF HERCULES feels and looks like a cheap cash-in copy of 300 for the most part. Scott Adkins, who plays the stock villain in the film, is even dressed up to look like King Leonidas in his early scenes. The hero is played by Kellan Lutz, who played in support in THE EXPENDABLES 3 but has no discernible talent for his leading role here. In fact, he's dreadful. He may have a huge, Schwarzenegger-style physique, but he makes Schwarzenegger's acting style look like Laurence Olivier's by comparison.It doesn't help that the below-par script was written by Sean Hood among others; Hood similarly fumbled the recent CONAN THE BARBARIAN remake, although that was better than this. There's little story and instead plenty of CGI-enhanced action including war scenes and fights with dodgy-looking lions. Some of the fight scenes aren't too bad, but they're overly stylised and feature silly scenes of characters doing superhuman jumps through the air and messing around instead of finishing off their opponents quickly.All that was left for me to do was to sit back and count the appearances by actors from no less than four TV shows. Gaia Weiss, from VIKINGS, is the love interest, and Roxanne McKee (GAME OF THRONES) plays Hercules's mum, although of course she's far too young for the part. Kenneth Cranham (ROME) shows up as a slave trader. Best of all is Liam McIntyre (SPARTACUS) playing Hercules's friend and ally. I was amused to see that McIntyre is given an ugly fringe haircut so that he doesn't distract from Lutz's appearance. Anyone who has watched and enjoyed SPARTACUS will know McIntyre would have been far better in the lead role.",0
"Amphitryon and his army fight to the gates of Argos, Greece, circa 1200 BC. Amphitryon challenges the incumbent king to one-on-one combat to avoid hundreds of further deaths. Amphitryon wins and becomes king of Argos. Queen Alcmeme is not pleased with this result, and implores the goddess Hera for relief for her city from the conqueror. Hercules is conceived (via Zeus) in response.Hercules (called Alcide in the front end of his life) is second in line to his brother Iphicles for the throne of Argos. Bad blood arises soon enough over Princess Hebe, whom Hercules loves and whom Amphitryon promises to Iphicles. To separate the brothers, Amphitryon sends Hercules and soldiers to Egypt on a mission. This does not go well for Hercules and his ally Sotiris. Will the hero find his way out?The set design was much worse than the camera work was good. The use of slow motion was ridiculous. The words Hercules, Zeus, and Hera had a bit of similarity to common usage. The story is nonsense, beginning to end, with little to do with any of the usual versions of the history of Hercules.It's difficult to like this one.",0
"Reid has always been obsessed with UFOs. While on a weekend trip to Vegas, he convinces two friends to join him on a mission to break into Area 51, where they find terrifying proof of alien presence......Found footage films, you either love them, or hate the socks off them. Unfortunately, every once in a while there is a really good movie released in this genre. Willow Creek, Exists, The Borderlands, and the V/H/S series are fine examples of how a found footage movie can work..........but there is a slew of rubbish that you have to trudge through to get to the impressive ones.This falls far into the latter category.So we have the usual gang of teens that we get in these films, one is always obsessed with the subject matter, and the others, dubious as they are, always go along for the ride, because it's a road trip isn't it?So we get the usual footage of people driving to desolate areas, where they are confronted by suspicious looking people, they talk to other people with whom are also obsessed with the subject matter, and this happens for the majority of the film, and the first two acts just drag and drag until we finally reach the titular place.By this time, you couldn't care less with what they discover, and even though the last ten minutes are impressive, both visually and atmospheric, it's too little too late, for the rest of the film is just so boring you lose any interest for the characters, and their quest.Copies are destined to be buried in the Nevada desert next to E.T.",0
"I definitely had higher expectations for Area 51, especially given that Oren Peli had written and directed and reinvigorated the ""found footage"" genre with Paranormal Activity. I'm a fan of the genre, a fan of the Peli, but this was absolutely abysmal from the very start. The concept could have been extremely engaging and given a unique twist, but it performs and plays out as expected- completely typical and utterly predictable, very poorly acted and nonsensical most of the time. I would have been disappointed even if it were a Direct to DVD or On Demand release. I guess the merits of this film like wholly on ""From the writer and director of Paranormal Activity!"" However, don't expect the competency which the latter film was delivered. There is very little entertainment value, lines are cut off mid-sentence, and somehow, despite being allegedly filmed with one camera, it switches angles regularly without disrupting other dialog. It places it's weight on technical talk, the late night AM radio conspiracy chatter, but does nothing to actually give the viewer anything to grab on to and immerse themselves in the adventure of these three hormonal boys.If you'd like to reduce your IQ level or waste your time while sick and just need to say you've seen it, you're better served by searching online for conspiracy videos, which provide far more interesting concepts and, despite being rather extraordinary, manage to entertain, which Area 51 fail to do.",0
"Okay so first off let me just say that I created this IMDb account after watching this movie, just to review it!. My friends and I have been waiting for this movie to come out for a while after first seeing the trailer for it on Facebook, which mind you, was probably scarier than this entire movie. I am a huge fan of alien movies like dark skies, alien abduction etc, and if you share the same interest then I suggest you only watch this movie if you have absolutely nothing else to watch but if you can avoid it, do it. It had some semi scary scenes, maybe a whole 5 minutes of the movie was actually exciting but other than that it was a bunch of 20 something year old, who seemed to know way too much on how to break into various locations on government technology, running around with video cameras. A lot of the story wasn't explained properly, it left me feeling confused and unfulfilled.",0
"Found footage genre hasn't found much success after the initial trend start with REC or Cloverfield. It attempts to create a more personal experience with first person view often falls flat with cumbersome shaky shots and unclear scenes. Area 51 suffers from the same exact problems and it stutters towards the end, but it also manages to set an occasionally interesting trip, especially in the first half.Story follows Reid and his friends as he tries to infiltrate the highly secured titular facility. To do so he must investigate the area and bypass many security measures. For most early parts, the film delivers quite the ride as audiences follow these guys on Vegas and its surrounding. Some investigations and interviews set the tone right, and not in overly silly way. Characters are also pretty decent and likable as though they are real life friends.Unfortunately, it soon arrives at familiar territory of hazy shots and mindless running. The scenes in the city or desert are identifiable, but when it is stranded in dark corners, the movie loses the momentum significantly. Script is also numbingly bland as characters would yell the same thing over and over again, this is especially true when they are repeatedly shouting, ""We gotta go"". With both visual and audio decrease in quality, it just turns into a confusing escapade.Cinematography is to be expected from this kind of found footage flick, it's rather elementary, but there are a few good shots with modified vision. At several scenes the film builds up the suspense pretty well, these are not all translated into thrilling moments. It almost seems like it has problems in latter half, resorting to cheap alien gimmick and nullifying its early decent production.Area 51 has a presentable start with more engaging use of the found footage, but it falls to the same issues and ends up like the rest without accomplishing much.",0
"The first question needs to be, are we not getting tired of these camcorder lost footage movies? Ever since the overrated ""Blair Witch Project,"" we have been deluged with similar-themed films; most of which fall way, way short of being anything but tiresome. So enter Oren Peli with his own take on the concept, but in his favor we have the mysterious and always-intriguing Area 51 as the backdrop. That fact alone is precisely why I decided to give this film a look.At first it appeared that Peli might have done it right. Blending actors and sets with real people and locations associated with Area 51, the set-up is intriguing. Even the process in which these filmmakers attempt to foil some of the high-tech base security systems, seems plausible. So far so good.But it is when the title characters break into the house of an Area 51 / S4 worker and steal his 'card', eventually actually getting inside the top-secret facility, that the movie becomes completely unbelievable and downright ridiculous. Everything that follows is what we have come to know, and depending on how you feel about these shaky-cam movies, love or hate about the concept.It's not that ""Area 51"" is a bad movie: the performances and design is actually of high-caliber, but given the exciting story set-up, Peli really should have given us a whole lot more than just another camcorder film. In fairness, I think some people will enjoy this. I did not.",0
"If you're seeing this film and expecting something spectacular like Casablanca or Citizen Kane, that's not going to happen. This film isn't meant to be great, but made for those who like something a bit scary. It really isn't too bad of a film once it gets going.It starts out slow and stumbles a bit, that's true, but in the second half it picks up. It gets interesting once the characters are inside Area 51. From there, it's hard to look away, not knowing what to expect. It was definitely different, but not great and not terrible either.",0
"I love scary movies, and I really love ""scary"" movies-- from Blair Witch to Paranormal Activity, I've always been a huge fan of shaky cameras and found footage. Ghosts and aliens scare me, and classic terror tropes work wonders on me! Things jumping out from behind other things and unexpected screams are my idea of a fun movie night.If you are looking for a scary movie with aliens as the focus, I would recommend picking up Dark Skies, or John Carpenter's The Thing... but not Area 51, because this is a terrible film. I put it on expecting to be shock-scared, or at least creeped out... but all I got was progressively more and more annoyed.The first half of the film does absolutely nothing but establish that the viewer should lack empathy for the main characters-- they are vapid young men who enjoy drinking, planning ineffectively, and disrespecting professional entertainers.The second half of the film is meant to heighten the viewer's anxiety and presumably scare us, but it falls disappointingly short in that respect. Instead it devolves into lots of running and flailing, lots of awful camera work, and terrible physical acting. When the end finally comes, it's more a relief than anything else.The only positive thing I have to say about this movie is that the main characters' treatment of their female colleague was basically respectful, which is more than what I can say for most movies that are structured in the ""x number of guys + 1 girl"" model. Nobody grabs her breasts or calls her disgusting names or belittles her intelligence based on her gender. That's awesome.The rest of the film? Really not so much.",0
The film was a cut above the rest of the usual hand held found footage horror films. The Area 51 itself was interesting and they had some cool special FX. The downside is the camera shaking all the time which makes it very annoying to watch. Beside that I enjoyed it.,0
"So much haters on this website. You wonder why? Because honestly if you like alien stories and suspense then you definitely going to like this movie. Well at least I did. And I am not even a big fan of camcorder movies. In fact I don't really like that way of filming. I am sure it would have been even better if they would have filmed it normally. Nevertheless the whole movie is full of suspense. From the part where they prepare themselves to the part where they decide to execute their plan to enter Area 51 it's all suspense. The actors might not be well known but at least they put down a believable performance. I really don't get why so many people don't like this movie. You know it's going to be about aliens just by the title of the movie. If you don't like that then just don't watch it, but please stop wasting our time with negative comments.",0
"AREA 51 is a typical kind of found footage movie, watchable enough but not offering anything up that hasn't been done a million times before. A bunch of kids decide to head off and infiltrate Area 51 to find out if they can uncover evidence of extraterrestrial life, but of course there are the usual surprises in store for them. Much of the running time smacks of padding and there's only real substance at the climax, but even then it feels like a sci-fi focused BLAIR WITCH re-run.",0
"Three guys plus a woman conspire to break into Area 51 and learn its secrets. The secret US test base for experimental aircraft? Nope. That other Area 51 with all those alien secrets. Filmed in Nevada, the film spends the first hour attempting to make us believe these High Tech Macgyvers can pull it off. Then the rest of the film attempts to be interesting, but fails, thinking throwing a few decent special effects at us will compensate for a boring first hour and haphazard ending.My advice is to fast forward through the first hour, so you won't be out of steam when it starts to get decent.Guide: F-bomb and nudity",0
"Oren Peli gave us Paranormal Activity way back in '07. I liked it a lot, and it kind of brought a new resurgence to the found footage genre which has exploded since then. Since then he has racked up a bunch of writing and producing credits but now finally 8 years later he has directed his second feature.Area 51 begins like so many other found footage entries of late. A bunch of young adults with a camera film their partying, going to strip clubs, basically doing a bunch of young adult stuff.But when they decide and plan to infiltrate Area 51, things get really interesting. Peli brings a lot of refreshing ideas to the table and in my opinion, totally delivers. The tension and suspense as these people infiltrate first the area, and then the actual facility is nailbiting. Once inside, we are treated to a non-stop ride of weirdness and all kinds of alien technology and other stuff I won't mention.Definitely a must-see for found footage nuts like me and fans of sci-fi horror in general. There's a lot to like here. 8/10.",0
"I have recently just finished watching this movie, and what torture it was, but thankfully I made it through with only 1hr 30 of missing time.I decided to watch this movie because I love anything to do with UFO's, aliens, ET etc..so this should have been right up my street. It wasn't.From the first 10 minutes I knew i would hate this movie, the acting is laughable, absolutely laughably bad which completely put me off. The plot is completely ridiculous and stupid and all the way through you are thinking, sure, of course they would make these stupid decisions. Every UFO/Area 51 cliché is in here which to any avid UFO fan who has a keen interest in the field it just makes you cringe. Its like they have read a few UFO stories on the net and put little bits of detail from each story in here. The most secure base on the planet and some young idiots manage to break in without being seen. You cant even get near the place because of the perimeter control yet they manage to get in easily.And finally the whole film being recorded through a camera has been done to death, its not fun or clever anymore, its a cheap way for a director to make a quick buck for little time and effort. This movie probably took around a week to film its that bad. Please, no more shaky camera films, they are boring and unoriginal, they have been done too many times.All in all, this movie was genuinely one of the worst films i've ever had the misfortune of seeing. People can make their own minds up but I cannot recommend avoiding this movie enough, its a terrible waste of time.",0
"This was better than I thought it would be. I had no hopes for this at all. I'm tired of the found-footage films, though I'm not sure that's actually what this would be. I found myself entertained.The part towards the beginning when Reid and Derrin are sneaking around in some guy's house was tense, and it had a jump scare. There were actually a few throughout the film, but not many.They had an interesting storyline, because who doesn't want to know about Area 51? However, for such a top-secret, high-security military base, the security seemed rather lacking both before and after they entered the base. Through quite a lot of their time in the base, Reid, Derrin, and Jelena would talk with normal pitched voices and run down the stairs like a pack of elephants. No security was around. That's not how I'd envision any military base, let alone Area 51.The alien was interesting, in the very few frames they showed it. I guess the design wasn't considered serious enough, so they devoted as little footage as they could.The tenseness of the scenes was fun. I would've waited in the car with Ben.Overall, I thought it was a fun movie. I gave this a 6-star rating.",0
"When will these movie makers realize that the current format for found footage movies are just downright terrible. They all follow the same format. 60 minutes of extreme boredom,then there is fifteen minutes of planning a trip, ten minutes of lets do something incredibly stupid, and then if, just if they show you what is attacking/chasing it is a millisecond of a glimpse.Just one rhetorical question though. Why is it every single alien movie that is made anymore is always found footage? Have writers lost their creativity and can't actually write a good blockbuster alien movie? One last note. Found Footage movies would be a million times better if they would show you what the creatures look like. And not just a glimpse.",0
"I did not expect much going into this movie. I was hoping for a little better than Alien Abduction. That being the case, I ended up pleasantly surprised! The first 70% of the movie could have been condensed into about 10 minutes of plot actually necessary to understand and enjoy the movie. However, it was worth sitting through to get to the last 30%. The suspense was surprisingly effective. I even found myself tensed up and gritting my teeth a few times. Special effects, although not plentiful, we effective as well. I agree with a previous reviewer that I felt dissatisfied with the end of the movie. I think that, maybe with a bigger budget and a well thought out ending, it could have been much better. A pure horror fan will likely not appreciate it. On the other hand, if you enjoy SciFi/horror/suspense combo flicks, then it's definitely worth a watch.",0
"Oren Peli is now officially a one trick pony after his latest found footage flick called Area 51. Again, similar to the first Paranormal Activity, there is a lack of story and realistic actions by characters in Peli's latest. Additionally, characters are weak, having little to no back-story and often times unlikable. Even with Peli's out used hand-held style of filmmaking, there is a particular originality to the film based on the alien side story. There are creative imaginary thoughts and well done shots of cinematography with this film. It almost seemed the film steadily managed to save itself as the film progressed. By no means would it be a film I recommend to people looking for the latest and greatest of 2015 but it's not a total waste, even when I wanted it and expected it to be.",0
"Bought this film from Sky. What a load of crap. Only watched it because I'd paid money for it and thought it might get better. Unfortunately, it only got worse. If this had been free, I would have deleted it within 30 mins. Please, please, please, do not waste any of your life watching this utter crap. This Film Is Complete And Utter Rubbish. Quite honestly I think it was written and acted as if this was your first drama project in secondary school. You're given an idea and had to develop it. If I had been their teacher, I would have gave them an F, in fact it would have been ungraded. It was like they'd ran out of ideas at the end, or the school bell had rung and they had to make an ending. It was that bad, that there isn't even a soundtrack when the titles rolled at the end.",0
"Director Oren Peli (Paranormal Activity) demonstrates that low key acting and high-tension situations combined with the right amount of digital effects can rock ""found footage"" horror films. Writer Christopher Denham fleshes out the mysteries of Area 51 with a disturbingly realistic tone.All three mains Jelena Nik, Reid Warner and Darrin Bragg commit fully to their roles as unlikely explorers thrown into a maze of military secrets, alien artifacts and very real, very ticked-off extraterrestrials.The third act was so good and so hard hitting that I had to remind myself it was ""only a movie"" several times.",0
"Area 51: Directed by Oren Peli and written by Christopher Denham and Oren PeliI have to just lay this out there for folks right off the bat. I can not stand found footage movies. That shaky cam and trying to make things realistic to make people believe that what is happening is real really make me nauseous. I get severe motion sickness from watching this type of cinema. I decided to forgoe my distaste for found footage movies because I found the idea behind this movie to be interesting. Three friends decide to sneak into Area 51 and document what they find there. Every person who is interested in aliens and UFOs know all about Area 51 and everyone wants to know what is going on there. I'm no different. I went out there to Rachel, Nevada to visit it. I got a little giddy by watching these places on the screen again. I enjoy it and I'm intrigued by it. I still have this nagging feeling though that this movie had no need to be found footage. It could have been a standard narrative and achieved far more success. When they make it into the base and the camera is still going wild, I had a difficult time determining what was happening. I wanted to know some semblance of what was happening. I wanted those moments between the friends and the woman who helps them where we learn about who they were as people. I wanted to know why they were obsessed. We never really learn much about any of them. You also find yourself asking why are they still filming when things go insane. It's the same question people ask when they watch a found footage movie. Making this a standard narrative removes that problem from the story. The ending was also blah. It has that usual bad ending that a lot of these found footage movies have and it was kinda BS. The beginning spoils this ending as well. The performances are pretty meaningless and outside of the interest in UFOs and Area 51, there's nothing to do here. It's scattered and a wasted potential. I hate to see that. I give this movie a D.",0
"After a mysterious encounter at a party, Reed becomes obsessed with breaking into Area 51. Unfortunately, we're just not as interested as he is.Area 51 scores a zero on character development, deciding on character templates that are so familiar to schlocky found footage films that they instantly feel overdone. Along with his two friends and the daughter of an Area 51 tell all book, Reed is suspiciously erudite when it comes to the craft of breaking into top secret government installations. Out of the box he knows how to get past the high tech detection grid, and even has a map of the prized underground S-4 base.There is little suspense and most of the more 'tense' moments are too predictable to raise any anxiety.As for the discoveries themselves, most are torn out of the most boring chapters of UFO Folklore. Spoiler Alert: there are aliens at Area 51. We never get to see them.The ending is a contrived bit of Alien Abduction straight out of every Alien Abduction film you've ever seen; just nowhere near as good.An Embarrassing moment for Oren Peli.",0
"OMG how bad is this film, its like its been put in a shredder and randomly glued back together again, the film jumps the dialogue too, it is totally awful awful film. All I can say is this is like a film students first effort and randomly shoots everything this is by far the worst film ever made utter garbage",0
"First, I must say that most of the low ratings for this movie say ""not scary!"" The movie may have been sold to audiences as a pure horror movie, but false advertising shouldn't take away from the movie for what it is: A found-footage movie about a group of friends (one way more than the others) who go to great lengths to break into Area 51 that should be classified as a suspense sci-fi movie; definitely not horror.A great portion of this movie is about the set-up of these guys (and a girl) getting ready to sneak into the lower levels of the base, which I can see how the average movie-goer could scoff at. If you go into this movie hoping for action, I'm sorry. Though it isn't what many were expecting, it is still very interesting to see their plans unfold.The third act is where it really surprised me. Oren keeps with the golden rule of good horror: waiting for the unknown is a lot scarier than finding the unknown. You see very little of the aliens, which could be a let down to those looking for a monster movie. But watching the shadow of the aliens walking down the hall, or seeing an alien slowly slide from the darkness is truly creepy. There were many times I was very tense and on the edge of my seat.The ending isn't as bad as many people are saying, for I kind of liked it. With some slightly better writing/imagination towards the ending, it could've made this movie a true diamond-in-the-rough. The acting, despite what many say, is tolerable and, for the most part, believable. The main character does have these moments of awful, goosebumps- inducing acting, but the other elements of the movie made me forget about it.All in all, give it a shot. Its streaming on Netflix, and I'd say its well worth a shot. Worst scenario, you lose an hour and thirty minutes of your day. Or you could walk away with a pleasant experience. Just remember to keep your mind open to what the movie wants to be, not what you want it to be. Have fun!",0
"A young guy obsessed with government secrets rounds up a gang to infiltrate a remote facility and uncover the dreadful truth.Literal found footage - wait for the post-credits clip - and a voyage through the varying degrees of hand-held shakiness. I think it's well shot up to the 2/3 stage, then the jitters break loose and it gets a bit annoying.The set-up is pretty much the tale of a depressed obsessive, and I enjoyed the characterisation. But they leave the impression he's a chosen one, which doesn't play out in the end. Also there's drama about bringing the girl on the mission, but she doesn't add to the climax.Few sound effects - the editors very selective - and I don't think there was any music (apart from the party stuff).Overall, it sets up well but falls short on spooks in its descent into Hardy Boys yarniness.",0
"As a big sci-fi fan and UFO-enthusiast, I really recommend watching this film. Even though I watch a lot of movies, I was a bit discouraged watching it because of the '4/10' rating. But unlike what many people here wrote... This movie did not disappoint me in any possible way. It has a great build-up, strong climax and mind-challenging ending. The constant suspense (after the introductions), no obvious scientific 'mistakes', some good jokes at the right times and zero jokes in serious/tense moments. The acting, the story, It all felt very credible to me. Bottom line: If you like the Area 51 mystery, give the movie a chance and the credit it deserves. Don't always rely on IMDb/'critic' ratings. I was physically ill after watching Gravity. If you agree with me on that part, I think you'll be safe watching this movie! Also, If you enjoyed the movie ""as above, so below"", you're quite certain to enjoy this.",0
"Movies about demonic possession have been around for a very long time, some are terrifying, some are horrible. I saw the trailer for The Devil Inside when I went to see Paranormal Activity 3 and the whole audience was screaming, I have to admit that it gave me the chills too. Even though it looked a little silly, there were some genuinely creepy moments. So I saw this yesterday and despite all the bad reviews I was really curious to see what this movie was about and to give it a fair chance and may I say that the bad reviews are very justified. Not to say that this is the worst film I have ever seen, but I am getting sick of the ""lost footage"" genre, we know it's all fake so why bother trying to make us believe that it's real? Though the one thing I really give the film credit for is that it tried something different by making it into a documentary type of movie, which was really cool and I loved that it looked at both the scientific and religious side of demonic possession, giving the viewer a reason to question what was real and what was possibly a mental illness. However the slow pace of the creeps and the scares leads into one of the worst endings in movie history.Maria Rossi committed a triple murder during an exorcism performed on her. The Catholic Church became involved, and she has since been in a Catholic psychiatric hospital in Rome. Her daughter, Isabella, learned of the murders from her father, who died three days after telling her. Twenty years later, Isabella is in the process of filming a documentary about exorcisms, and to find out more about her mother, she visits a school in Rome that deals with exorcisms and enters a classroom where students, priests and scientists are having a discussion about whether or not a subject is possessed by a demon or just has a mental condition. She has dinner with a few students and ends up getting a little closer with two priests, Ben and David. They talk more about the differences between being possessed and mental illnesses, and inform Isabella that they can't explain the differences, it's something you ""just know"". On that note, Ben and David are operating outside of the Church and performing exorcisms to help patients. Isabllea then decides they are the perfect duo to help her mom, but they may have bitten more than they can chew when they accept.If you make a film about demonic possession, offer something new that we haven't seen before. I'm not talking about just the contorted bodies and talking in tongues, but they offer something great with a demon that could jump from body to body just terrorizing every humanbut then after this great idea and making you want even more, they pull the rug out from under you. Also, when did the demons get such a potty mouth? Taking a page from The Exorcist? The film does copy off of previous possession films which makes it not as original. The characters are unbelievable and not sympathetic so you don't care about what happens to them. Why would a family put their possessed daughter in the creepy basement locked up? Why after a priest tries to drown a baby during a baptism he's able to just walk out of the church? And why in these lost footage films do people during critical times always grab a camera? There are some good little scares with the mother who the film is somewhat centered around with her possession, what a chilling performance. However with a horrible ending, the movie is just ruined. The audience comes wanting to be entertained, not feel like they just got slapped in the face as the director is counting their money laughing to the bank.2/10",0
"On 30 October 1989, in South Hartford, Maria Rossi (Suzan Crowley) brutally murders two priests and a nun during an exorcism and calls the police. Two years later, she is arrested and sentenced to the South Hartford State Asylum. However, a couple of months later, she is transferred to the Centrino Mental Hospital in Italy. Twenty years later, her twenty-five years old daughter Isabella Rossi (Fernanda Andrade) accepts to make a documentary about her mother and she travels to the Vatican School of Exorcism in Rome. Isabella befriends the priests Father Ben Rawlings (Simon Quarterman) and Father David Keane (Evan Helmuth) in the school. Then she visits her mother with the director Michael Schaefer (Ionut Grama) that is shooting the documentary. The two priests invite Isabella and Michael to witness the exorcism of a young woman. Then they go to the hospital where Maria Rossi is interned to exorcise her. Father David shows the evidences to the Church and Maria's doctor but they are not accepted. Sooner Father David is possessed by a demon and commits suicide. Isabella has a seizure and Ben and Michael take her to the hospital. Sooner they learn that Isabelle is possessed by a demon and they need to take her to Father Gallo to help Ben in an exorcism. ""The Devil Inside"" is a noisy and disappointing home video of bad quality with another story of exorcism. The acting is not bad, with the Brazilian Fernanda Andrade in the lead role; but after the original ""The Blair Witch Project"", the documentary ""style"" using a Handycam has become the favorite of people that wants to make a cheap film. The conclusion is absolutely disappointing. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""A Filha do Mal"" (""The Daughter of the Evil"")",0
"If star ratings were awarded for trying, The Devil Inside would definitely get 5/5 stars. It truly wants to be something. Ever since the Blair Witch Project redefined horror with its 'first person perspective' there have been many imitators.Some have worked, others haven't. Sadly, The Devil Inside is the latter.Every post-Blair Witch first person film will be judged against Blair Witch and, although The Devil Inside tries to break away, it doesn't really succeed. It's about a girl who goes to the Vatican to track down her long lost mother, who was sanctioned by the Catholic Church. Was she simply mad, or possessed? The Devil Inside lurches from one carbon copy of another similar film to another. I saw shades of Paranormal Activity mixed in there with The Last Exorcism (both superior films in my opinion). The actors did as best they could with what they were given. As with these kinds of films, they did well to capture the 'naturalistic' elements of their dialogue.It's just not that scary. If you've seen one exorcism movie, then you've basically seen this one (even if this one does do it from a first-person perspective - which The Last Exorcism has already done anyway).It's not bad, it's just not original. And (SEMI SPOILER ALERT) the ending will leave viewers thoroughly divided. You only have to look at some message boards to see that some people loved it - most despised it and felt ripped off.It's your call. If you really need one more exorcism movie, then give it a go. But you've probably seen everything The Devil Inside has to offer before... and better.",0
"Despite not being a fan at all overall of the found footage/mockumentary style, there are some good exceptions out there. While not an avid horror fan, though a long way from a detractor, there are some great examples and some great films based on the subject of exorcism (the king of them all still being 'The Exorcist').'The Devil Inside' however really fails to deliver. Did form my own opinion, though with a little knowledge of only a few reviews before watching, and watched with an open mind, actually wanting it to be good and be better than the slightly drab premise suggested. 'The Devil Inside' was just a shocker in almost every sense of the word, we are not talking about the type of film it is but the actual quality of the film.It's not entirely without redeeming merits, though the cons are far more numerous and significantly larger. The best performance comes from Suzan Crowley, who gives a heck of a chilling performance. Surprisingly also the contortionist effects were pretty unsettling.However, that is it for 'The Devil Inside's' good points. 'The Devil Inside' has such a drab look and further cheapened by the excessive and badly abused (even for this particular style of filming) shaky cam, which will make people nauseous and should come with a health warning for epileptics (speaking as one myself).Can't remember anything about the music, while the directing is lifelessly amateurish and the script is a shambles with far too much talk and too much emphasis on the science-versus-religion and faith-versus-scepticism, which really bogs down the atmosphere.No better news about the story or atmosphere either. The story is sluggish, increasingly derivative and predictable, with some unintentionally silly parts too, while the atmosphere in general is just too histrionic and there is next to nothing scary in a film already rather under-populated in the scare factor. Only Crowley and the contortionist effects offer any kind of that.Much has been said about that abruptly lazy cheat/cop-out of an ending and for very good reason. Crowley aside, the acting is very poor, with a lead performance from Fernanda Andrade that is both histrionic and somnambulist.All in all, a shocker in almost every way. 2/10 Bethany Cox",0
"Exorcism of Emily Rose tops this movie.... And that's not saying a whole lot. The plot was good, the acting....par but you saw everything coming. The ending was I call a ""ran out of money"" ending. Definitely worth waiting for the DVD release. I didn't mind the whole Blair witch/paranormal activity/cloverfield camera action they used. It was just the fact you knew what was coming 1 step ahead. Not to leave out the very dull ending but I guess it would have cost too much $ to actually leave us paying folk to know what happened to the people we spent the last 87 minutes caring about. Overall had a few creepy parts. Dog barking made my body ache. Just don't waste your time and money running to the theater to see this one.",0
"The movie is only about an hour and 15 minutes. Nothing after the credits and the credits are the slowest scrolling credits I've ever seen in my life. My assumption is that it scrolled so slowly because there weren't a lot of people who worked on the film (since the cast was small and budget was low) and they didn't want the run time to be so short as to devalue the movie and discourage people from paying to see it; thinking they wouldn't get much bang for the buck. I guess they had to do something to extend it and this is what they chose.It's filmed in a found footage/documentary style that works for the movie. It doesn't use too many cheap or jump scares. The only bad acting belonged to the chick who played Isabella Rossi. The most important character in the entire movie is actually the person filming everything named Michael and he gets the least amount of face time and dialogue. None of the footage would even exist if he wasn't filming. Therefore, without him, no movie. He does express that during an MTV's Real World type confessional. There actually is a story here. It's not just a bunch of things happening on screen with no rhyme or reason. The story itself is very good. I like it. It's not necessarily original but the way the movie ends, if there is a sequel, it would have to be filmed in a more traditional movie-making style. That means no found footage. I just gave something away if you're paying attention.There are intentional holes left in the movie that can only be answered with a sequel. Like Maria Rossi's possession. Why was she chosen to be possessed, why did the demon who possessed her make her do what she did, and which demon possessed her? I think exorcism as a whole could be explored more since part of the theme of this movie is the law surrounding the act of exorcism and how it needs to change. Another theme is distinguishing between mental illness and possession; a separation of science and religion. I liked what they were doing here by exploring other aspects of an overused genre but all the questions weren't answered. That's not a bad thing. A different twist is similar to what was done in the movie Fallen and that concept was explained during the movie.If you're gonna see this, and I'd give this a thumbs up to see it, then go when there's gonna be less people in the auditorium or see it at a reputable theater and that's what I recommend for every movie anyway. This movie ain't worth full price. Catch a matinée or half price or something. Dollar movie works too. It's worth seeing in theaters.This movie didn't back down on violence. Just when I thought they weren't gonna show certain things, they showed it and I appreciated that. No watering down here although I believe some brief nudity in one scene would have added to the realism. This also reminds me of REC but this isn't anywhere near as good as that. REC, when watched under the right conditions, will stay with you for a while. It burns an image into your head that doesn't go away and that's what a good horror movie is supposed to do: make you look over your shoulder and around corners and through shower curtains and keeps you awake at night. REC does just that and gives a compelling story. This also has a good story that I'd really like to see continued if it makes enough money because, similar to REC, it appears there's something bigger going on and this first installment only scratches the surface. It teases more and I believe it can deliver with a second movie.The way the movie ends, there was a collective sigh of disappointment. It leaves you wanting more and since that's what made people disappointed, I'd say it did its job. It also makes you wonder because there is something that happens in that last scene and you don't know who the survivor is. That's all I'll say about that. The last scene was unique and a bit funny given the circumstances, I'll give it that much. It was original. If that last survivor is who it should be, then we have a sequel if they ever make it and I'd love to see it at an equal or better level of quality. No complaints about the special effects which weren't that many to begin with. I give this 7 out of 10 stars. Not a bad movie. Worth seeing. Not too scary but I'm sure some people will be affected by certain scenes because it doesn't use too many tricks to get the job done. It has a very creepy scene that affects you as if you were watching the movie Session 9. It's short but effective and that describes the entire movie. Just make sure to watch this with the right people in the right environment.",0
"If you enjoy scenes that come into focus and out of focus as the shaky camera also juggles, this is a great movie. If you think shaky cameras and blurry movies suck, then we are in agreement. This movie is so awful that I could not see much of it. The characters talk to the camera, because one of them is filming everyone constantly. So in addition to the shaky blurry scenes, we get annoying characters talking to the camera to let the audience know what they are thinking. I wanted to throw up on the television after a few minutes of this awful movie.",0
"First off, I'm not a 15 year old girl who just saw her first scary movie. Second, I really enjoy the intimacy and tone of found footage movies.I am shocked to see so many negative reviews about this movie. The trailer was not misleading? I'm confused about some of the negative hype. If you are saying there is no real ending to this movie, or that you don't understand, you need to see the movie again. It very clearly explains itself. I really enjoyed the ending. I really don't like hype, but I gave into it when people started posting the trailer everywhere. When it came out, and I saw all the negative reviews, I immediately lowered my standards. This movie did not disappoint.This is not a big budget thriller. If you want another cheesy movie with hot naked girls running away from serial killers, go watch Hostel. It may not be strikingly original, but I found the tone to be very scary. If you want to see the another Academy Award worthy film with amazing dialogue and special effects, go see something else. It is very rare that a movie gets my adrenaline going. You have to remember that this is supposed to be a documentary that takes place in the time span of a couple months, not a narrative about someone's life. You have to use your imagination to get into the style of film. I guess some people don't have imaginations anymore. I found the jump scenes to be quite frequent and valid to the story, although one jump scene with a dog comes at a random time in the movie, and has nothing to do with the storyline. There is more gore than I anticipated, which is a plus. I feel like they fit it into the movie very well. Senseless, randomly placed gore in a film shows me that the creators are trying too hard. The special effects were not overdone. The exorcism scenes were quite disturbing, unlike what others may be saying.The story takes a turn when after the exorcism of the lead role Isaballa's mother, the demons transfer to the priest, and eventually Isabella. I guess people are interpreting this as a hole in the story or something, but I thought it was a great turn.Summary: I'm extremely picky on horror movies, I find most to be either over done or really generic. This one got me. I am a fan of the style of film, although some people are not. This movie will receive low ratings because it's not The Sixth Sense or Insidious, but will end up with a good cult following, seeing as some people do actually care to have a good thrill. If you like Blair Witch, I'd highly recommend this movie. I was NOT disappointed.",0
"This movie was absolutely pathetic. The actors were terrible and the whole story was just awful. I am really surprised this movie made it to the theatres and made the amount of money it has. I am pretty sure the audience wanted their money back once they watched this turd. The movie has the potential for an interesting story, but the execution of the movie falls flat. The main actress is the worst amateur I have ever seen. The poor acting and bad story telling take you away from the experience that this is based on a true story or real life. I would avoid this movie and just rent The Exorcist. The trailer pretty much gives away all the major parts.",0
"I'm not even going to go into any great detail... This film is terrible from start to finish and I would urge you not to waste your money going to watch it.I like anything 'exorcism related', so when i saw the adverts for this i must admit i was quite excited, especially with all the hype surrounding it... I was severely let down to say the least. Quite honestly the adverts contain all the best and most important parts of the film, if theirs 20 minutes of action in total then that's it. To say it's supposed to be a horror film it's more laughable than anything else with no tension, build up, not even any 'cheap' jumps, i could've quite happily watched it when i was 10 and gotten a full nights sleep afterwards, let's put it that way. The cast are totally, TOTALLY wooden and i'm embarrassed to say that the British Simon Quarterman is the worst of them all, his acting was that bad i just wanted to punch him the whole way through, it's like not one of them could be bothered to do a decent job and didn't want to be in it as much as i didn't want to watch it.Terrible story line, terrible acting, terrible everything. Please don't waste your money.",0
"I think everyone is giving this movie a bum wrap. Yeah, it didn't have an amazing ending, and in all honesty, I don't know a lot of horrors that do have successful or satisfying endings. I really don't think they are the primary concern of this genre, and if they are, they're the difference between 7/10 and 10/10 stars.The fact is, this was a creepy movie. I was legitimately upset watching it. I think they did a great job of incorporating claustrophobia with the completely unpredictable mother, it was very uncomfortable and I was impressed. Were the characters any good? decent enough for me, when are characters ever really that brilliant in horrors? Again, it's not my primary concern, I go with the hope of being scared and this movie was more successful than I'm used to in that sense.I was also very impressed with how well they shattered the sense of safety in the movie. The demons were running wild, they made significant development jumping between people and they were totally unpredictable. They were always initially restrained and they were always too strong to be held back.My only real complaint: I'm tired of the documentary style horrors. Yeah, maybe they would have been better off ending the movie 2 minutes earlier. I don't care, I'll get over it.",0
"The Devil Inside merges two sub-genres of horror that should be killed off like the teens in a remade slasher movie. The exorcism genre and the found footage genre have long overstayed their welcome in the film industry and need to be abolished. The found footage genre, I can sometimes tolerate. The exorcism genre I can barely look at. Merging them together is a colossal miscalculation.There is something in cinema nicknamed ""trailer fail."" You may not know the term, but you've certainly experienced it. When a comedy movie experiences ""trailer fail,"" it means all the funny and entertaining scenes exist in the trailer, rendering the rest of the film as ""filler comedy."" If an action or science fiction film is victim to it, take Richard Gere's The Double, it gives away the big plot twist in the trailer. And if in a horror film, this happens a lot in found footage films, all the jump scares and interesting scenes are in the trailer. The Devil Inside isn't a case of trailer fail, but a case of trailer disgust. Every scene in the trailer is the highest quality material you'll find in this film. If you didn't enjoy the trailer, then you didn't enjoy the best parts.Most exorcism movies pack in a redundant and asinine plot. This one is no exception. In October of '89, Maria Rossi (Crowely) committed triple murders while performing an exorcism in her ragtag house. Twenty years later, her daughter, now grown up, is Isabella and is in desperate need for answers.She and her convenient documentarian friend take a trip to Rome, Italy where her mother is being held in a mental hospital to not only seek answers from her, but to dive into the mysteries and the actions of exorcism.We get a bogus 911 call at the beginning, shaky camera footage upon arrival to the house of Maria Rossi, fake news reports, then we get about a half hour of incredibly mundane and dry dialog about religion, Christianity, the Vatican, churches, and of course, exorcisms. Tell me, Paramount. If you want this to be the next Paranormal Activity, why did you include so many tiresome scenes of dialog that will bore your audiences? That's not to say films like The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity didn't have dry spots. I was never bored by either, but can see why some were. The big difference with those films is they both had one thing to back themselves up with; an eerie, ominous atmosphere. Nothing about The Devil Inside's setting is eerie or ominous. It's as dry as the material we're presented with.I will say The Devil Inside gave me one of the best theater experiences I've had in a while. Usually, when a movie ends, at least in ones I see, everyone just gets up and walks out whispering or being utterly silent. I was in a theater of about fifteen people of all different age groups and as soon as the abashed ending rolled around and concluded the mess we all watched, everyone was yelling obscenities and mimicking the film they just saw. When I was in the restroom at the end, I engaged in multiple conversations with people who were just as angry and as cheated as I was. One man said ""I haven't seen something that horrible since Will Ferrell's Land of the Lost!"" A woman was questioning the ending from multiple aspects. I turned to her and said ""a movie of this poor nature is not worth your good questions. It can barely answer its own."" Ever since The Exorcist in 1973, we have been paralyzed by the very thoughts of exorcism. Now, we've seen it all. Some people in my theater were laughing at the film. Because it focuses on the exaggerated hokum of the practice. Like all of the movies do. Climbing the walls, spider-walking down the stairs, screaming, using foul language, and out of place deep voices have all become standards in these kinds of films.Last year, around this same time, a movie about the dramas of the practice came out. It was Anthony Hopkins' The Rite, another film of the same nature I found long and tedious. But at least it had insight, which I believe I acknowledged. The problem was it was long and uneventful, but at least it didn't try to glorify the practice. The Devil Inside doesn't even look in the same direction as the new ground it likes to think it is breaking.I bring up The Rite because in the time frame of almost a year I've seen a long drama about the practice and a terrible found footage faux documentary on it as well. I found The Rite afloat in a sea of mediocrity, and I find The Devil Inside to be a work of trash filmmaking. My question; will there ever be a good exorcist movie ever again? We've seen two films in two separate genres fail to bring justice to the idea of the practice. My assumption from here on out is that we will never get a film like the 1973 masterpiece.It's only January, and I have the perfect candidate for the top of my worst films of the year list.Starring: Fernanda Andrade, Simon Quarterman, Evan Helmuth, and Suzan Crowley. Directed by: William Brent Bell.",0
"The Devil Inside is the first demonic possession film I know of to entertain the idea of back-alley exorcisms – that is, those performed by ordained exorcists outside official religious jurisdiction. They're portrayed as progressives eager to bypass the hypocritical and bureaucratic sanctioning of the church, which, according to them, has been alarmingly selective when it comes to who can and cannot receive the services of an exorcist. Officials stipulate that there's a definite difference between possession and mental illness, and not all cases fall into the former category. The priests in this film understand that there's a definite difference, although they also believe that a great many people are authentically possessed and have been overlooked by the system. And so, under constant threat of discovery and excommunication, they provide help to those who need it.On the basis of the film's pathetically low Rotten Tomatoes score, I would wager that most critics somehow missed this surprisingly clever and timely social commentary. It seems we're also in disagreement over how frightening the film is. While by no means the scariest movie ever made, it effectively builds tension, and there are moments that made me jump in my seat. Is it just that I scare too easily, or did I remember how these movies are supposed to work? Furthermore, there's something to be said about a demonic possession movie that doesn't hold back in terms of disturbing visuals; in the course of this movie, we will see people contorting into impossible shapes, splayed bodies at a crime scene, and in one instance, profuse vaginal bleeding. The only time I thought the filmmakers went too far was in a scene that, oddly enough, did not involve an exorcism. Instead, it involved a baptism.Having said all that, some of the criticisms aimed at this film are valid. From a technical standpoint, it breaks no new ground as a found-footage mockumentary, at this point a genre in and of itself. We have the usual fare: The combination of hand-held and surveillance recordings, the persistent use of the Queasy Cam, the frantic journeys through dark corridors and rooms, and the bookending claims that (1) the film is documenting a real event, and (2) the case remains unsolved to this day (we're even provided with the address of a website to visit for more ""information""). Structurally, it gets off to an implausible yet decent start, only to become more predictable and routine as it enters the final act. Initially engaging characters become progressively less developed until they're reduced to stock horror movie caricatures. And then there's the ending, which isn't bad so much as it is abrupt. When the credits start rolling, there's the unshakable feeling that something more needs to be said.The film opens with a recording of a 911 call made on October 30, 1989, in which we hear the emotionally vacant voice of a woman slowly confessing to the murders of three people. We then see police footage of the crime scene, and yes, we get ample views of three gore-ridden bodies and the blood-stained weapons used on them. The victims, we soon learn, were trying to perform an exorcism on the murderer, a woman named Maria Rossi (Suzan Crowley). After being arrested, the Catholic Church got involved and shipped Maria off to a sanitarium in Rome. The details of the America-to-Italy transfer are a little sketchy, as is the reason for having her sent to Italy at all, but never mind. At this point, we flash forward to footage shot in 2009. It seems that Maria's daughter, Isabella (Fernanda Andrade), has hired a documentary crew to follow her to Rome and capture on film the attempts to save her mother.After attending an exorcism seminar, she's introduced to two priests, both ordained exorcists. One is Ben (Simon Quarterman), a Brit who entered the priesthood largely due to his uncle. The other is David (Evan Helmuth), an American who's also a licensed physician and has built his reputation on the fusion of science and religion. While both are men of faith, they disapprove of the church's dismissal of certain possession cases, and they take it upon themselves to perform the necessary exorcisms – a big no-no. They make it clear that, in order to really understand demonic possession, Isabella will have to witness an exorcism first hand. And so she does. She will also reunite with her mother, who becomes dangerously hostile at the sight or even the mere mention of religious paraphernalia. The only exceptions would be the inverted crosses she has cut into her forearm.That all of this is ridiculous, there can be no argument. All the same, the characters were developed in such a way that I was genuinely curious about where the story would go. Alas, the Maria Rossi subplot is eventually dropped altogether, at which point the film stops being character-driven and becomes a run-of-the-mill horror thriller. Ideas that were only alluded to, such as multiple demon possession and the transference of a demon from one body to another, are now foremost on the minds of the filmmakers. Given the deceptively satirical undertones of its opening and middle acts, this is a bit of a letdown. All the same, ""The Devil Inside"" is nowhere near as bad as most claim it is. If you can see your way past its lack of originality and authenticity – which is, when you think about it, the case with most horror movies – I think you'll be plenty satisfied by what it has to offer.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",0
"The Devil Inside focuses on Isabella Rossi as she tries to figure out the mysterious murdering spree of her mother 20 years before. She later finds out that it was during an exorcism that her mother killed three people. After being arrested, Maria Rossi is sent to a mental hospital for the criminally insane in Rome and Isabella travels there to figure out what is wrong with her mother. The problem is more than just a mental illness, but evil itself incarnate in her. My first thought before seeing this movie was that it was going to be another one of those ""exorcism"" movies. Turning heads, spider-walking down the stairs...we have all seen them. Before this film, most exorcism flicks just focused on these traits. None of them really discussed the religious aspect in terms of the Roman Catholic Church. I commend ""The Devil Inside"" for doing this. It really revealed the true inner feelings of the Church on exorcism, especially in today's society. Some people are separated in the idea of exorcism, even the religious people and this film did a great job in conveying this confusion and conflicting views. Mental illness is the panacea diagnosis, but there may be something more. Honestly, I am not a very big fan of the hand-held camera style. But this movie, overall, did a great job with handling this style. Yes, there were spots where the camera was a little shaky, but it's a given with these kinds of movies. The camera was almost always on the action that was happening at the moment. It didn't try to trick the audience by moving the camera somewhere else while there is a mêlée happening just outside the view of the camera. The fake-documentary style is one of my favorites, mainly because of ""The Last Exorcism"".Overall, the plot was very well planned. It was quite an original plot with a unique twist on multiple-demonic possessions. I thought that the plot flowed and didn't drag in any spots. All speaking parts fit in with the action and all discussions explained important aspects necessary to understand the movie. All in all, this is one of the scariest movies I have seen. Everyone in the movie theater was on the edge of their seats. Yes, the ending was a bit disappointing, but the cliff-hanger was a great way to end this movie. This is a kind of movie that if it ended on a good note, it would have ruined the mood of the whole movie. That shroud of mystery was a perfect touch. I found the ending words that ""the case is still being investigated"" to be a little cheesy, which is why I gave it 8 stars. But other than that, I would highly recommend that you watch it. It is well worth every penny. Enjoy!",0
"First of all, I just want to say that I went into the theater with very little expectations for this movie. My friend had been talking about how she wanted to see it since the trailers first started popping up. So, we ended up going last night to see this (opening night).Let me just say that the theater was PACKED for this movie. We got to the theater 30 minutes before the start time and the line was already out the door. As for the movie itself, it started off slow in the beginning and slowly got more and more intense. The exorcism scenes were especially frightening and very well done in my opinion. The movie is a mockumentary style movie, so it does feel real as some points. The ending is very intense and I was pleased. However, most of the theater booed when the credits started rolling. Of course, 75% of the theater was teenagers.Overall, I give this film a 7 out of 10. It wasn't the best exorcism movie I've seen; but it also wasn't the worst. Worth the money.",0
"*Very minor spoiler. This is my first review. Have mercy.Important note before I begin:The problem I see with people watching movies like ""The Devil Inside"" is that they go in restless expecting people to twist into knots and get ripped apart with nonstop action. This is not that movie. I walked into the theater just wanting to be entertained and simply put, I was. What I find to be necessary in slower movies like this is to let yourself become absorbed in the story rather than trying to poke holes in the story and critique it as you watch it. I let myself be absorbed by the film and that is the perspective I will review it from.Review:This faux documentary centers around a girl who all but witnessed her mother murder three people in what is later discovered to be an exorcism. Obsessed with finding out the truth of that night, she embarks on a trip to Rome with her filmmaking counterpart in order to document their adventure into the dark world of exorcisms, and what they find is disgusting, shocking and grotesque in a few instances, but you just can't look away. What the director has done here, is try to balance dialogue with action... a risky deviation from most horror films. The dialogue is a bit slow sometimes, but it is never off topic and keeps the story moving while giving a little more depth to each character after each sequence. Now don't mistake what I am saying... the screenplay is far from revolutionary, but it is a good start. The dialogue can be a bit cheesy certainly not helped by periods of lackluster acting, but as a whole, the film did not disappoint. A good exorcism movie is hard to make simply because the viewer knows the stereotype and no one has yet to deviate from it yet. This movie tried in its own way to reinvent the exorcism movie and did in some ways, but kept faithful to what we know and appreciate for the most part. ""The Devil Inside"" is not the action movie to go see with a bunch of friends. This is a movie best seen quietly. Take it in. Try not to pick apart every detail and your movie-going experience will dramatically improve for this movie. I give it a solid 7/10. I left entertained and frankly a little freaked out. Exactly what a good horror movie should leave you with.",0
"First and foremost I will say that this is a mockumentary type movie. A mockumentary is the kind of movie where they make it seem like a documentary but it's fake. I like them because they seem more real, This one includes interviews, hand-camera shots etc. I'll say it right now and that is if you don't like blair witch style movies and those fake documentary style movies then this probably isn't for you.The movie itself is about a woman who discovered her mother was involved in an exorcism and was shipped out to Rome, Italy afterward and she goes to discover why and look for some answers.Things all go downhill for her from there.The movie's acting and story are great I had no issues whatsoever with it there. You could tell it seems a tad amateurish in terms of their acting at times but I still thought everyone did well in it.The story and scary scenes were all great, I've seen a number of these styles of movies, Quite a lot more then the average watcher and this one while it won't give me nightmares at night it still delivered a few very solid and tense scenes. I was a bit let down by the ending though and that was my only issue I had with the whole film. The make-up and dialogue were all very good too and at times during some of the exorcisms it almost reminded me a little bit of the original exorcism which you can tell the film makers had a lot of influence from that.My only qualms against this movie were that there could have been more scary scenes and I wished for a better ending. That said though the scary scenes that were there were very nicely done!I have a feeling this movie will get a lot of hate because of its mockumentary style of filming which is not very Hollywood like of horror movies so I feel a lot of people will dislike it for that but if you're in the mood for a horror that's got a dark realistic tone to it then by all means give it a go and you shouldn't be disappointed.",0
"Before saying anything, let me point out I watch all films with an open mind, and normally I can enjoy a film regardless of how technically poor it is.This however, was a farce. I honestly can't believe this film got released into theatres, scene after scene was a regurgitation of scenes that we've all seen before. Not just individual scenes, but the whole tone of the film was so familiar and dull.I didn't take count, but after a noticeable amount of times of the date being shot at me with a low dong was laughable, the bloke who made it must've watched paranormal activity and thought ""ooh that was good, I'll have that... then I'll grossly over use it"" There was nothing new about any of the exorcism scenes, apart from it was with a hand held camera.. wow. just watch the exorcist and shake the TV around.I felt like i was watching an awful, pretentious student film from the outset and most of the acting had me cringing in my seat. I literally have never seen a worse all round acting display in my life... it was just totally unacceptable. They were trying so hard to make it look 'real' or 'genuine' and it just looked pathetic, so many face head scratching and little smirks to themselves.I won't go into the ending... but it summed the movie up really. unoriginal, contrived and no shock factor (which was obviously intended) you know when a film is so bad its kind of entertaining? well this is just offensive. It was shameful. I can't think of one redeeming quality.DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS FILM",0
"Where do I begin? This movie is awful, in every aspect of the word.Further justifications: Every thing sucked in this film. The acting was very wooden. Fernanda Andrade is not a good lead actress, but she is hot, so I guess the film could score mild points for that...but the rest of the cast is just incredibly bad (Hmm...That's a bit of a stretch...Suzan Crowley is pretty freaky as Maria Rossi), but every other actor looks like they couldn't care less about the film. They look annoyed, even more annoyed than the audience watching it. It's as if the project was something very boring for them and they couldn't wait to get the hell off of it.I understand this is mockumentary, but whoever was handling the camera sucked. Did he just discover the zoom button? Because the fact that the camera would close up on faces and then back continuously really annoyed the $h!t out of me. Finally, I felt there was a lack of scares: I jumped once, which is the same place I jumped in the trailer (the one where Maria Rossi starts to laugh suddenly). The scriptwriters decided to get lazy as well, I suppose, because right when the movie is about to get interesting, it cuts to black and ends, telling us to check a website. What's that if it's not telling the audience to f--k off. I felt like I had been insulted.Bottom line: I knew from the start that this movie would be bad. A friend of mine convinced me to go with a few girls, who chose to see this movie. If only I had listened to my first instinct.Look, this movie made 33 times it's budget on opening weekend (33 million dollars for a 1 million dollar budget). The studios don't care about the people who watch this film anymore, and quite frankly, you shouldn't care about this movie either. It's not worth seeing in theatres - wait - It's not worth seeing at all! When is Hollywood going to realize that over doing mockumentaries just gets annoying because they don't scare us anymore. Hollywood, never, ever, release a film this bad again! 1/10",0
"Found footage horror films these days are almost a dime a dozen, and to a discerning audience who will almost always head to the cinemas regardless, the challenge is to go one leg up over previous offerings, although most of the time many will fail at the final lap providing an ending that is quite disapproved of. The Last Exorcism was something that went out with a bang that was much reviled, but this one, directed by William Brent Bell, who co- wrote the story with Matthew Peterman, got critics and audiences up in arms in lambasting it as the worst film of all time. But is it really?The ingredients for a horror film that serves up its fair share of scares are all inside this effort. There's Rome, there're demonic possessions, there's creepy sound effects and shadow and light play, jump scares, quick cuts, the works, although given that it's of the found footage genre one really cannot complain about the jerky and shaky camera-work that could get a little bit nauseating. It begins with a mystery, where a woman got makes a call to the police confessing having to kill 3 persons, only for us to slowly realize through newsreels that it was three persons involved in an exorcism on the woman who had turned tables around.We then fast forward to the woman's daughter Isabella (Fernanda Andrade) who decides to go solve the mystery behind her mother's deeds, who is now locked up in the Vatican's appointed hospital for psychiatry. A documentary crew she conveniently commissions follows her to Rome, where she meets up with the priests Ben (Simon Quarterman) and David (Evan Helmuth) who soon bring her to experience one of their exorcisms performed on a woman called Rosalita (Bonnie Morgan), where the episode serves as a jump point and catalyst for everything else in the movie to follow on at breakneck speed, with the usual inputs that you'd already come to see in countless of exorcist type movies, and develops with a hint of what's being known as transference.There are a couple of open, unresolved subplots that have opened the doors for prequels and sequels to happen, although whether or not these will be done is a huge question given the very large backlash. For instance, the back-story of Ben was kept very ambiguous, as is Isabella's, both having done something that could either be revealed to be more than meets the eye, or expanded for a little bit more depth. The build up toward the final act was great, because it created such a huge expectation that the stunt it pulled off in the last scene is admittedly very ballsy, although it got a reaction opposite of what it expected to be rewarded for having the guts to be different, pulling the plug and denying everyone a climatic battle to the finish.Many will fault the film for that, and probably bear a grudge to condemn everything else that transpired in the film, which to me feels a little bit unfair. It decided to do what it set out to, and reminded everyone again of going back to basics for the sub-genre - something has to happen in some fashion like this for the found-footage itself to work. It is found after all, and inherently that calls for things to be left hanging, logically speaking. I have to credit the film too for being the only one I've seen so far in a horror film, where menstrual blood got spewed from the source and found reason to be splattered all over the camera. Talk about morbidity when you least expected it, in the most gooey fashion the filmmakers conjured.For what got invested in production, the box office returns already made this a success, thanks to horror film aficionados who contributed to its coffers early in its release, before word of mouth slowly condemned it to fall quite spectacularly at the charts. Still, those looking for some scares will find The Devil Inside serving them up, but you'll just have to hold on to your horses at its ending - if you're open minded enough it's something you won't condemn immediately, especially if you take a step back to consider its few production and narrative merits.",0
"Caught an early showing tonight. I really enjoyed this one. Better than Emily Rose IMO. Shot in the documentary style of Paranormal Activity, it follows a young woman on a quest to Rome to find answers about her mothers possible demonic possession. She follows two priests working outside of the Church who perform a series of exorcisms. Very intense and disturbing imagery. There were quite a few scenes that made me jump. The acting was pretty good from all the players. A particularly creepy performance delivered by the womans mother locked away in an insane asylum in Rome The ending was kind of a surprise but I enjoyed it. They shoulda saved this one for a Halloween release, but since the world is supposed to end on Dec 21st this year,the studio must have been concerned about missing out on DVD and On Demand sales.",0
"This film had a lot of bad reviews on here and the ratings are quite low for this movie, which after seeing it I don't understand why. I love a good 'Found Footage' film, and I don't mind a good possession style movie either, and this has both of those elements. I went in to watching this with some apprehension after reading such mediocre reviews ready to turn it off after 10 minutes, but as I watched it I was drawn in more and more. It had tension, atmosphere and some nice bloody scenes. Throw in some cringe worthy scenes and in my opinion you have a good little film here. I was pleasantly surprised and at the end I was glad I actually watched it. So because of that I give it a solid 7 out of 10.",0
"I'm glad I didn't listen to all the bad reviews of this movie. I own a commercial Haunted House and this movie was entertaining. I don't scare very easily and there were several times where it startled me. Was worth the money. At the end of the movie, there was a scene that was silent and you could hear a pin drop to the carpet in the crowded movie theater (no candy wrappers, talking or noise from the audience). My haunted house bases it's scenes on scary movies and I got a couple of good ideas from the movie. One thing I didn't care for was that the movie was trying to make you believe it was a documentary so the camera was very shaky and made me kind of dizzy at times.",0
"The Devil Inside is a combination of The Blair Witch project, and The Exorcist. The Devil Inside has a warning that it can cause anxiety! The film did cause anxiety with some movie goers when we finished watching it. The film starts off documentary style with some murders and years later a daughter visits her mother in a mental institution to find out what happened. Many people get possessed and many bad events happened. The ending is tragic. The ending reminds me of The Blair Witch project. Not a bad film but the movie was only around 70 minutes, which is short. The film is a seen it done it before film similar to The Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity etc. I give The Devil Inside a six out of ten.",0
"Good movie good plot but you see a lot of the stuff coming. I normally don't like the 'hey let's make a documentary about scary shit and hope it doesn't go wrong' but in this movie they kind of made it work so good for them. The actors were okay. Not the best but it was watchable. Fernanda Andrade was okay she wasn't my favourite tho, she was kind of okay with everything which I thought was weird, because there was literally someone possessed right in front of her. My favourite character was probably Simon Quarterman. He did alright and at least had some character development. The rest was just doing what they already did, with Father Ben we really saw what happened with his uncle etc. The only thing about Isabella that actually stayed with me was that she had an abortion. The ending absolutely SUCKS, it's such a good example of 'damn uhh we're out of budget so meh I guess we'll let the audience decide the ending.' BAM credits. The only two scenes that really stayed with me were when Father David shot himself and when he drowned the baby, lmao looks weird when i write it down. But anyway, that's basically everything you can say about this movie. The storyline could be really good but they didn't execute is the way I thought.",0
"I very rarely walk out in the middle of a movie. But I did last night about one hour into ""Wrinkle In Time""--and I was glad I did. This film had everything wrong with it, direction, acting, scripting. About the only aspect I found somewhat rewarding was the special effects, which kept me in my seat for at least those 60 excruciating minutes. Ava DuVernay's direction bordered on amateurish. Her framing was uncomfortably tight in a number of shots. And I've seen more of Oprah's inside of her nose with DuVernay's camera looking up at the giant actress than I care to remember. The pouting Storm Reid, playing the 13-year-old Meg Murry, was unrelatable as the heroine of the film. And most irritating was her younger brother, Deric McCabe, whose high-pitched voice was barely intelligible. Walt Disney Pictures should be ashamed of themselves releasing this complete waste of time. I've seen film school studio projects better produced than this. I hope the paying public avoids this film and sends this film quickly into the trash dump.",0
"And that was ""What the hell did I just watch?"" and variations. I haven't read the books, I have no idea what the story was supposed to be, but even so I knew there was something deeply utterly wrong with it. It really felt like the hallucinations of a drugged person trying to make sense of the story behind and failing miserably. It was so bad that I suspected sabotage. Is it that someone intentionally didn't want it to be any good? I know I should attribute to malice what can easily be explained by stupidity, but in this case, it is far from easy.The only reason I rated it three stars (towards the funny end of the spectrum) is because of its inadvertent humor, best appreciated while drunk or stoned or part of Myst3k. So many scenes seem to hint to other materials: Star Trek, Dr. Who, Neverending Story. Or maybe it was just me trying to make sense of something completely random. A good description for this movie: white noise. A better one: pretty colored noise.",0
"By the time ""Wrinkle"" reached its climactic scenes, where the stakes are highest and the resolution hangs in the balance, it carried so much forward momentum that I had to keep waking myself up so I wouldn't snore and bother the other theater patrons. Yeah...it was like that. Look, I'll admit: I've never read the book (shame on me, I guess, as a lifelong lover of SF and general metaphysical weirdness), so I can't judge DuVernay's ""A Wrinkle In Time"" as an adaptation of L'Engle's literary favorite. But I CAN measure it as a film that wants to tell a story, and on that scale...um......Uy. Never is there a real sense of conflict with which to engage: the tone and mood are so lovey-dovey, from stem to stern, that the film never feels like it's progressing in any meaningful way. The galaxy-gobbling threat doesn't, and isn't. Good performers are wasted on one-note characters (be they whimsical space-nymphs or oh-so-precious baby geniuses) in puzzling costumes and -- were those hairdos? I think they were hairdos. I mean, they were where hair is supposed to be. Expensive FX fill the screen in service to a plot that *drifts* through its paces instead of *advancing*. If there was variance in the musical score, I missed it (but I think I didn't, because I think there wasn't). Michael Peña is asked to leave his ""Ant-Man"" charm at home and put on a goofy mustache and some red contacts for like a few minutes, and Captain Kirk (the new one, anyway) has a beard and is interesting, but doesn't really do anything and OPE what nope I'm awake not snoring sorry no.This is going to be someone's favorite movie, and that's a beautiful thing; art needn't be categorically *good* to be *effective*, after all, and I love the hell out of ""Xanadu"", so I should know. But a film that wants to tell a story should be equipped to tell a story, and if it can't do that, then...it's doing something else, I dunno, I'm.........huh? No, no, I was just...just resting my eyes. It's nice, maybe you should do the same.",0
"Wow. Something went wrong here. For a movie with the backing of Disney and all the resources that they poses, they must have turned a blind eye to this film, or they must have tried to manipulate and control it super tightly. This movie shocked me with how bad it was, and how Disney would release a movie this bad. They don't do it often. From start to finish, this movie is disorderly, and confusing. Maybe because I didn't read the book, but I shouldn't have to read the book in order to enjoy the movie. The actors all seemed to lack chemistry and understanding of the role. The three children just couldn't carry the plot along. It was a disaster around every corner. A Wrinkle in Time could easily be turned into a rated R film in my opinion, the one thing holding it back was the fact that it was kids and Disney. But had this been Tim Burton like Alice in Wonderland, well it would have been better directed, but it would have set in on a specific style and flow. A Wrinkle in Time never really planted its feet into a specific feel. It seemed to take itself super seriously, but what was happening on screen didn't match up. The score really didn't help. The movie was scored as a dramatic, serious, epic, however, on screen it was kids running around to ""save the world"". The effects were beyond cheesy. I countlessly had flashbacks to the fantastic hit ""Spy Kids 3: Game Over"" and its partner ""Shark Boy and Lava Girl"". In all regards, this movie could rival those movies on the Disney Channel, but this one is too messed up and twisted for kids to even enjoy it. They managed to make a movie that both adults and children could dislike. Disney seems to achieve first still today.",0
"I was speechless after the credits started rolling. The women next to me asked what I thought. I told them some of the crucial, pivotal aspects they had so obviously left out of the film version by choice. It was a fatal mistake and I believe they did it for reasons that directly contradict L'Engle's reason for writing the book in the first place. ""Sounds like we should go read the book."" That was the best message I could offer to anyone else who wants to know about the movie. Forget it. Go read the book. The movie is a hundred-million-dollar backstreet rape, bereft of all magic or joy. This film was made by the creatures of Camazotz and offered at the altar of IT.. Such a shame. I really was looking forward to this one. What we got is smply dreadful.",0
This movie has nothing to do with the books I enjoyed as a child. In fact it was so poorly adapted that to even call it A Wrinkle in Time is an insult to the original book. If only I could fold time and go backwards to get my 2 hours back and the $$ it cost!! Save your money and your time it's not even worth renting!,0
"I'm confused how so much money was put into something the director clearly couldn't care less about. Only Storm Reid seemed to put an effort into her acting. Oprah and Reese Witherspoon were dull but that seemed what the director desired. Mindy Kaling was annoying and distracting as her awful acting took you out of the movie experience. I just don't know how the director shot this and decided ""yes that's a good take."" The adults in this film either mail it in or are just not talented enough for their role.",0
"One of the WORST movies I have ever seen. There was absolutely no plot, and the OVER acting made me cringe. This movie was so bad that I resorted to doing online HOMEWORK on my phone. I would have just left, but someone else bought my ticket. It was the SLOWEST 109 mins of my life! Pure GARBAGE!",0
"Watched it on NETFLIX last night with my four grandkids (13, 11, 8 and four). When it was over, I asked ""did y'all like it ?"" In unison all said NO.My husband and I thought it was a complete waste of our time with the kids. It's the first Disney movie I can say ""I hated it.""",0
"This is probably the worst Disney movie I've ever seen. It's also probably the worst movie I've seen this year. The movie for starters is flat out BORING. The majority of the film is people standing around talking, and they aren't talking about anything interesting or that advances the plot in most cases. There's some beautiful imagery here, but then there's also too much green screen and CGI going on that it just loses it's luster. What is the deal with this director also? There were probably 70+ shots inches away from each actors face. It didn't look pretty and was extremely distracting to me. Somehow this director had all of these great actors and couldn't even get anything out of the majority of them. Chris Pine was about the only person that did a good job here. I would not recommend this to anyone. It's unbelievable that this is a film with a budget over $100 million. They should have never even released this travesty.",0
"This movie is terrible. Cheesy as hell, terrible acting and nothing but garbage. DON'T SEE IT.",0
"I ignored the bad reviews and went anyway. Disappointing is probably an understatement. This movie is a disaster. Not only is the acting incredibly awful, especially from some otherwise accomplished cast members, but the original storyline was all but abandoned. I read the book several times, and even I was confused what was going on in this film. There was no explanation for any of the concepts, character development was nonexistent, special effects were plentiful but meaningless. The most fascinating parts of the book were eliminated, or only presented so quickly that it was difficult to understand why they were happening and how they related to the story. This movie could have been SO great - there was incredible potential here, and Disney and the director literally wasted it all.",0
"I was excited to watch this movie. High expectations based on all the marketing given to it. It ended up being extremely boring, too slow. No action or great parts at all. The story starts and develops so slow and with nothing exciting to tell. There were moments (if not the entire movie) in which all the magic could be seen as fake and special effect only. The acting for the main character is bad. Very bad. I could tell it was too acted. Really, sad too see such a beautiful story brought too life to become so boring and say nothing at the end of it all.",0
"This is what happens when you collaborate talent with a personality that walks on air! Oprah can never get real performances and real feedback because her ego is so blunted with power and control. She lost focus...totally! Her constant desire to evangelize her positions taken to film failed miserable here. Even Disney capitulated to her. This is like Steve Jobs opening a pizza franchise--he's Steve Jobs, of course it will succeed! Actually, not. If this is a taste of Oprah's leadership, she will be a train wreck as bad as Trump! In fact, they have a lot in common, they just go about it differently. Live n' learn Disney. Someone just got fired for caving to the O!",0
"How could this movie with an accomplished director Ava DuVernay and Jennifer Lee, the screenwriter behind the wonderful animated films like Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen and Zootopia as well a beloved yet brillant source material by Madeleine L'Engle turn this adaptation into a beautiful yet disappointing mess? Truly all of this expectations for this film turned into a great let-down.Even a well studded cast is unable to save this wreck. Worse is that the dialogue, character development, the overuse of CGI and the convoluted plot is making it a major disappointment of 2018. Even the acting is not good with one that goes unnatural like Mindy Kaling and Zach Galifianakis while Reese Witherspoon's and Deric McCabe's acting goes over the top and very annoying and even Oprah Winfrey comes as total bland and boring.The only redeeming qualities is that film contains empowering messages as well a great statement to diversity and feminism as well the performances of Storm Reid, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Chris Pine which are the only saving graces. A Wrinkle in Time should have been the next Wonder Woman. It's a big shame that all of the great intentions were given a waste of time, effort and talent.Lastly, it is clear that the adaptations of sci-fi genre cannot work for Disney as demonstrated in the previous sci-fi adaptations that failed before such as Tomorrowland, Tron: Legacy, and John Carter.",0
"This movie made me want to read A Wrinkle in Time again, because I don't remember the book being this trippy....or disjointed...or heavily reliant on colorful CGI... . Maybe the novel really is unfilmable, because this movie is a mess. From the acting to the plotline to the cinematography-nothing really works. It just goes to show that you can't rely on Oprah to solve all of your problems.",0
"What do you get when you take, horrid visuals, terrible acting, some of the worst direction you've seen in a film complete with awful shot composition and a hundred foot tall talking Oprah? You get the worst film of 2018 so far, Disney's A Wrinkle In Time, of course!",0
"I'm always in favor of a good lesson for kids wrapped in an adventure, no matter how out there it might be. The astral travel in A Wrinkle in Time is where teen Meg (Storm Reid) must go through a portal to find her scientist father. He's been gone for 4 years, having discovered that portal as physicist and entered it, foolish dad to abandon family just to go where no man has ever gone before.Unfortunately, Meg's coming of age as she travels with wunderkind little brother, Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe), and high school chum Calvin (Leo lookalike Levi Miller), never involves defining challenges but rather just murky CGI and an evil force straight out of Arrival's Rorschach alien. While we hear about her need to have more confidence and be more aggressive, when she finally achieves those, the film is almost over, and the transforming beats are not obvious anyway. Even the ""Which's"" interstellar guides, play by Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, and Mindy Kaling, are unimpressive personalities with equally unimpressive costumes. While they might be a cross between the benign Glinda of Oz and the three witches of Shakespeare on Prozac, they are not seminal to Meg's development or the plot's.I can advise Oprah to slink back to her kingdom and Pine to go back to his starship. As for you, audience, I advise you to avoid this clunker and see The Shape of Water. No, that's not kids' stuff, but maybe that's all for the good. As Oprah's Mrs. Which intones, ""Trust nothing."" Trust not this film to do justice to Ms. Lengle's original.",0
I do this review justice when I say shark-nado had a better story line.,0
"I had been looking forward to this movie because the trailers made it look like it had potential to be a lot of fun. Unfortunately it lived up to none of that potential. Horrendous acting, insultingly cheesy special effects, confusing directing, and a clumsily written screenplay made for a punitive moviegoing experience. My nephew was bored five minutes in, and I was cringing. I am shocked that Disney released this in theaters. They usually have more respect for their customers.",0
"Goodness, this movie sure didn't go over with a lot of people! Oh, the anger, the disappointment, the sadness! But actually it's pretty good, at least according to my girlfriend and myself.Based on the classic kid's book, this tells the story of two children who go on a crazy, mysterical adventure in search of their father, a physicist who somehow made it into space with nothing more, it seems, than a wish and a prayer.I've read the book a couple of times, once as a kid and once as an adult surprised because he didn't remember how Jesus-y the book was.I like the character of Meg, who is smart and determined and afraid and in desperate need of self esteem. One of the major themes was, love yourself, and I found Meg's growing confidence touching.I was a bit disappointed by Charles Wallace. I recall the character being odd and brilliant, but in the movie he really seems like a pretty ordinary kid. I had an affinity to the book Charles Wallace because I saw myself as odd and intellectual gifted (in retrospect I was more the former than the latter), but I didn't see myself at all in this movie version.The three wise ladies are fun, particularly a funny Reese Witherspoon as the most prickly of the bunch. The special effects looked good (caveat, I saw this on TV) and the story is well paced. Like any good kid's movie there's a nice mix of humor and pathos.The religious aspects of the book have been stripped out, which I consider generally positive, although it does make the whole good/evil thing feel a little amorphous. I also felt the book was more interested in scientific thought than the movie, which leaves out things I loved as a kid like visiting a two-dimensional world.So why don't people like this? It could in part be the disappointment of the movie related to the trailer. The trailer made it look like the whole movie was this stunningly gorgeous bit of magic and female empowerment, but the scenes that made up the trailer are more the exception than the rule. Even though I enjoyed the movie, I think I would have enjoyed the movie promised by the trailer more.There are also super-fans of the book who are going to object to any changes, including the lack of religiousity. There are also, unfortunately, people who object to the children being biracial, wanting them to be the white children they pictured when they read the book. In fact, as I write this, the most-liked review on IMDB specifically complains about that. (The second most-liked review takes pains to say that's not the problem, though, so I don't think this is a simple case of crackers pushing the rankings down).Look, it's not a perfect movie. It's conceptually silly, and it's not one of these kid's films like A Little Princess that transcends kids movies, but it's lots of fun. My guess is it will be one of these movies that becomes more popular in 15 years as a generation of kids who liked it become adults who can offer opinions. Always remember: The Wizard of Oz bombed when it was released.",0
"I was excited when this was announced as this was one of my favorite books growing up and I still enjoy re-reading this series. However, I also kept saying ""I hope Disney doesn't screw this up again,"" after the travesty TV version they made in the early 2000s.Lo and behold, they managed to screw it up again.Let's start with the few bright spots (and calling them bright spots is even generous). First, I did enjoy the visual depiction of the tesseract. Also, the casting was pretty good. Storm Reid was well cast as Meg, and Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which were also portrayed well, despite that they drastically downplayed Mrs. Which's character.Now, the bad (and there is a lot of bad). Mrs. Whatsit was changed into a completely negative character who seemed completely inept and pessimistic. Important points in the book (Ixiel and Aunt Beast, for example) were completely ignored and given only cursory mentions so fleeting that you barely even notice it. The Man with Red Eyes is turned into marionette who literally collapses on screen. I get that in the novel he was a ""puppet"" of IT, but the depiction in the movie was laughable. The ridiculous storm scene when they first arrive on Camazotz came out of nowhere and was so ridiculously portrayed. First, they're struggling to find Charles Wallace, then they go through this ridiculous storm sequence, and when they make it over this wall (which again, was nowhere in the source material), that concern for Charles Wallace is completely gone until he pops out of nowhere saying ""here I am."" And are Meg and Calvin relieved to see him? Nope. It's more like ""meh, okay."" The movie completely left out how Calvin and Dr. Murray got back from Camazotz. All of a sudden, they're just back. Poof, no explanation.I get that certain stories require work to adapt: I didn't get particularly outraged with some of the changes ""Prince Caspian"" and ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" made in the Narnia series because those were short novels whose structure required adaption to make them cinematic. I wasn't necessarily pleased with all of them, but given the structure of the books, it was understandable that some work had to be done. ""A Wrinkle in Time"" was different. It's a very linear story which already was very cinematic and could easily translate itself from page to screen. But instead of a faithful adaption, the filmmakers decided to ignore 90% of the source material.Strike 2, Disney. You've now screwed this same story up twice.",0
"It's amazing that the Disney of the past which gave us Snow White, Pinnochio, Bambi and even 2001 A Space Odyssey is now turning our such complete garbage. It so boring and not true to the book. Plenty of liberties were taken with the story to lower the bar and attempt to appeal people without brains. A Wrinkle In Time should be titled: ""A Wastage Of Time.""",0
"There seems to be a decent story somewhere in this message. But I couldn't make it far enough in. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Now I'm just sitting in the parking lot, writing a review while I wait for my wife and kids to exit the movie in about an hour.",0
"Good: Some of the messages and morals of the story are heartfelt for its intended audience of children. The saving grace is Chris Pine. Even though he had a small role, he fit the role perfectly and was not so excessive. The color scheme is very bright and colorful, which makes the movie somewhat interesting, even with the subpar acting and plot.....Bad: The acting all around is either subar from the cast or over the top from Mindy Kaling and Zach Galifianakis that it comes out unnatural. Even with a good cast consisting of Oprah Winfrey and Reese Witherspoon, they did not add much to the movie's benefit. Disney spent so much money on its adult characters that they forgot to hire good child actors/actresses for the child cast members are not even on par with some of the amazing child stars from ""Stranger Things,"" ""It,"" or ""Jungle Book.""Overall: The movie is mainly geared towards elementary and middle school children with some adult aspects, yet the movie is childish and not up to Disney's standard. Disney should be embarrassed to have produced such a movie with big Hollywood names and have it bomb. The movie falls flat and lacks humor leading to a failure for Disney. Even though this movie is supposed to be a big statement towards diversity with a colored director helming a $100 million budget project, the movie does not do justice.2/5",0
"Twenty years ago, a student died in a high school play called The Gallows. Now the school is putting on the play again, with a jock who can't act as the male lead. The jock's irritating friend convinces him the play will stink and he will be embarrassed. So, along with another friend, they sneak into the school at night to trash the set so it will be cancelled. But they are discovered in the act by the play's lead actress and then everything goes to hell as the four find themselves trapped in the building with the vengeful ghost of the boy who died in The Gallows.Another found footage movie trying to find a hook in a played out horror subgenre. It has most of the usual found footage problems, including my favorite: characters continuing to film the terrifying goings-on in the movie even when all logic would dictate they should drop the camera. One particularly galling scene is when one character is running for his life and has to climb a ladder to escape the hangman ghost thing (don't ask). The guy holds onto the camera with one hand the entire time he climbs the ladder. I mean, come on, that's beyond stupid and unrealistic. The characters are very annoying in this. The guys are the worst, with Ryan Shoos giving new meaning to the word obnoxious and Reese Mishler having a slack-jawed wide-eyed expression on his face the entire movie. I can only assume he calls that acting. The highlight of the film is when Ryan's character calls Reese's character a bad actor. That the characters also share the names of the actors just made the scene all the more enjoyable. I'm sure Ryan loved getting to say what he was thinking about his fellow actor without breaking character. The two girls, Cassidy Gifford and Pfeifer Brown, are fine but ultimately forgettable. It's not a scary movie in any way. The beginning is very boring but, once it gets going, it at least manages to keep your attention. You probably won't like it much but try to stick with it for the unbelievably corny ending.",0
"Remember back when the found footage style was a unique style of filmmaking and only a handful of films used it? (I.E. The Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity, Rec.) But it's common knowledge nowadays that it's become a cliché and a cheap gimmick for studios to save on production costs. Most of the time, there is almost no effort put into the film's storyline, characters, or scares. The Gallows certainly doesn't help its case. Pros:-A few decent performances-Good production design-Has the potential to be scaryCons: -Insufferable main character-Bullshit plot twist that makes no sense-Plot itself is nonsensical-Relies on cheap jump scares-Has a few good ideas, but they're usually screwed up somehow.-Found footage style is given no explanation3/10 (Horrible)",0
"Twenty years ago in the small town of Beatrice, there was a terrible accident that took place during a presentation of the play ""The Gallows"" at the High School.Charlie Grimille, who was the understudy, filled in for the lead on opening night, but ended up swinging from the noose on stage during curtain calls.In an attempt to honour the anniversary, Beatrice High School's drama department decides to revive the play in an attempt to put the past to rest.Pfeifer, the star of the show, discovers her co-star, Reese, and a few of his friends, sabotaging the props one night. But when they are locked in the school with no cell service and no way out, they soon discover Charlie isn't at peace.....When I first saw the trailer for this, I was completely blown away. It was terrifying, and straight to the point. Boom!! The Gallows, girl gets noose around neck and gets dragged away. Trailer done..The film is very different, different as its a complete mess, poorly written, poorly acted, and quite incoherent. We basically spend the mercifully short duration watching teens waste their phone Batteries filming pointless walking back and forth down corridors.On the odd occasion there is a figure holding a noose, but what's horrid about it is that it looks like Kane Hodder on occasion, and totally throws you.The characters are wholly unlikable, and it all ends like you'd expect from a film that cannot decide where to go, abruptly.The bit from the trailer is there, and it's still good, but your eyes will be so rolled back in disbelief that you'll probably miss it. Better still, just watch the trailer, you'll save yourself less anger than having to sit through this rubbish.",0
"I saw ""The Gallows"" with low expectations, but at least expecting to see a decent horror movie, based on the IMDb User Rating (4.3). However, the film is awful in every aspect: the storyline is poor; the twist is nonsense and ridiculous; the screenplay is terrible. The camera of this cheap ""found footage"" genre is a pretext to produce low quality films with low cost. In this movie, there is no explanation for the use of the handy cam. Sometimes I question why I see flicks like this to the very end since time is irreversible and life is too short to spend watching low-quality films (like this one)! My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): ""A Forca"" (""The Gallows"")",0
"Do not, I repeat, Do not fall for the made up 10 star reviews...( It's obvious those affiliated with producing this garbage want to pique the interest of others so they give fake ratings & reviews, hoping others will be interested enough to see it- & they make more $$) Take it from me, Wasting my $ & time on this terrible so-called ""movie"" left me leaving the theater very upset I wasted $ on this trash & annoyed. All found myself wanting to do, was to drop-kick the blonde, camera-holding, guy. (.Whoever decided THAT guy has any talent in acting, needs to have their heads examined.,I can only surmise he has a family connection or paid to be in the film) The story/ acting was way too cheesy to be scary. I have nothing positive to say about this film. It was just plain junk. When I went to see it, it was opening weekend, therefore, there weren't many reviews or ratings accumulated to get a real idea of whether or not it was going to be any good. I believe this crap actually had a 6.1 rating...Now, for horror movies- I considered that to be relatively high ( even from just a couple hundred ratings) Wow, was I duped!! Now,after seeing ( most of ) the movie ( ended up walking out, it was THAT BAD) and then seeing the 10 star reviews, I KNOW the ratings on here can't be trusted...( until you see at least 5,000 - 10,000 people rated it) SO- save your $ , time & irritation -skip this boring, sad excuse & find something better...",0
"I knew The Gallows would be bad. I knew that it wasn't going to be my cup of tea but I love the movies that much that this was the only thing left I hadn't seen so in I went. It wasn't the worst thing I've ever laid eyes on but its the worse thing I've seen in the theatres in a very, very long time. I am constantly amazed how these films are still managing to get wide theatrical releases. I absolutely despise the ""found footage"" genre. Please kill this genre!! I mean, the movie is bad enough but add in the stupid concept of ""this is real, this was filmed on iPhones"" or whatever and it is even worse. Actually, if they just filmed this and any other found footage film like a normal movie it would be exponentially better. I've seen movies that had decent enough stories that are literally ruined by the found footage style. Yes it saves money but how many people would see it and enjoy it more. The Gallows though is poorly written, poorly paced with some very moments of terribly bad acting. It feels like it takes forever to get to the point (another usual issue with these movies) because they are dragging out a concept that doesn't have enough to be feature length. The Gallows further suffers by the fact that they try to give it an intellectual plot twist that is ridiculous and eye-rolling.The actors all portray people with their real names...because that makes it more real? They all have their moments where they are decent and are properly portraying their horribly stereotypical high school roles. Ryan Shoos is our main ""popular kid"" bully who films most of the movie. He is appropriately obnoxious and by the time he gets killed off you're actually glad to see him go because he's such a bully but he also gives one of the better performances in the film too. Reese Mishler is the misunderstood jock turned ""theatre geek"" and he is okay and has these big puppy dog eyes but man oh man does he have some moments of really bad acting. It almost seems like they had no script and suddenly he has no idea what to say. Its ironic that part of the film is how bad of an actor he is on stage in this play because his portrayal is equally as bad. Pfeifer Brown plays opposite him as his love interest and fellow theatre geek. She suffers from the same fate where some of her dialogue seems to get lost and she stumbled through not knowing what to say next. They have no chemistry but she does better than some of them. Cassidy Gifford certainly looks the role of the popular cheerleader, the girl is a stunning beauty and actually she gives a decent performance. I would almost consider her the scream queen of the film because her emotional break down is at least believable. She perhaps overplays it just a little but she's still at least decent.Every movie of this type is trying to carbon copy the only great found footage film and that was The Blair Witch Project. And then they attempt to copy the biggest financial success which is the Paranormal Activity franchise (entirely over-rated as well) so you have a blend of these two things and then they are trying to be creative and unique which I am convinced in this genre is literally impossible. Every scene feels the same and while there are a couple of jump-worthy moments and one particularly creepy scene (which has been done before too and better) the movie falls flat. I was bored...it was forgettable and I thought to myself several times that they needed to get on with it and that's a bad sign. The film is squarely aimed at a late teen demographic with the girls showing plenty of cleavage and the characters being so stereotypically ""teen."" It doesn't surprise me in the least that writing directing team Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing are just making their foray into big screen but my question is HOW?!? How do they get this very very average straight to video fluff released into theatres? And it makes money because it is so cheap to make. Don't waste your theatre cash on this...watch it at home if you must or if you're one of those die hard fans of this awful horror genre. It was forgettable and silly but wasted a couple of hours for me I guess. 5/10",0
"The Gallows (2015) *** (out of 4) During a school production of The Gallows, a prop goes horribly wrong and an actor is killed. Flash forward twenty years and the school is putting the play on again. The night before the show the lead actor and his two friends break into the school to damage the property when they bump into the lead actress. Soon the four are trying to find a way out but realize that they're not alone.THE GALLOWS is a rather strange movie because I started off hating the picture with a passion. I really do mean that I hated this film because I thought the first twenty or so minutes were incredibly annoying. I thought everything about the ""found footage"" film was annoying and especially the character holding the camera most of the time. For the life of me I couldn't help but wish something would happen to him because he annoyed me to the point where I wasn't enjoying the movie.As I said, the first twenty minutes are pretty bad but once the horror elements start and once the characters get locked into the school things really pick up. I really love found footage movies when they're done right and I think THE GALLOWS is extremely well-made and well-acted. As with the best films in the genre, what makes them work is how the camera just floats around and you're mind prepares you for something scary to happen but you just never know when it's going to happen and this just builds up more suspense.For my money there were plenty of very creepy scenes throughout the picture. This here is certainly the most important part but I'm not going to provide any spoilers so I won't go into any details about what exactly happens. I will say that the look of the killer was very creepy and it certainly helped keep you on guard throughout the ending. I also thought the four actors were extremely believable and good in their roles.As I said, I really hated the first portion of this film but a film like THE GALLOWS is made to scare you and I must admit that the film got the best of me and in the end I had fun with it.",0
"1993. A teenage actor in a high school play meets a brutal untimely end after a terrible accident occurs. Twenty years later a theater group at the high school decide to do another production of the play. However, several students take it upon themselves to sabotage said production by sneaking into the school late at night so they can trash the set.This film certainly starts with a jolting bang and concludes on a pleasing dark note. Moreover, writers/directors Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing do manage to generate a reasonable amount of tension and creepy atmosphere. Alas, the laborious opening third proves to be a real slog to get through. Worse yet, the three kids who sneak into the school to vandalize the set are extremely annoying and unlikeable, with obnoxious wisecracking troublemaker Ryan rating as by far the single most hateful and irritating of the rotten lot. The deliberately sloppy hand-held cinematography doesn't help matters much as well. Fortunately, the game no-name cast all give perfectly acceptable performances and the despicable jerks all bumped off in highly satisfying nasty ways. An okay time-waster, but overall nothing special.",0
"From thequickflickcritic.blogspot.com/I went in to ""The Gallows"" with an open mind. And, MAN, was my brain shut down but at HYPER speed.Aimless wandering through the seemingly interminable catacombs of a haunted high school. Entering dark and ominous halls and rooms which were everything short of SCREAMING at these clueless kids ""You'll get killed"" and for no discernible reason whatsoever. And, I swear, one more shot of a hand slowly opening a door to who knows what the hell (yet usually not a DAMN THING) and I'll put the flippin' noose around my own neck for crissakes! The ending (and thank God there finally WAS one) was admittedly and actually kinna cool. But it was WAY too little too late to keep this weak and wearisome found footage flop from hanging itself by it's own regurgitated premise rope.For more of my Movie Reviews categorized by Genre please visit: thequickflickcritic.blogspot.com/",0
"So apparently the plot of this movie is that in 1993 a school is doing a play called the Gallows. The character August played by Charlie Grimille something goes wrong with the props and everyone sees Charlie being hung dying infront of everyone. So in the film 20 years later which would place the film year 2013 the play is revived i am guess as a tribute to charlie. 4 Students break into the school at night and are haunted by a unseen spirit.There is so many things wrong with that i don't know where to being. The acting is decent i will give that to them. But the whole movie lacks really much of a story. Pfeifer tells Ryan your not suppose to say Charlie on stage it is bad luck kinda like a Macbeth thing. Okay fine and well but why is it bad luck? Why can't you say it has the play ever been done after the accident? How did they get the idea to redo the play? When Reese discovers his father was suppose to play August not Charlie question remains why did his father call in sick? Was it truly a accident or what? If one of the students is suppose to be Charlie's kid born after his death wouldn't that put them being 19 or 20 call me dumb but by then you should be out of school. This movie is just so awful really don't waste your time watching it. Don't bother reading the ""Fake positive reviews"" Because shows people don't know true horror movies.I always said a horror movie doesn't always need blood, gore, nudity etc long as it has a great story behind it a story that does not leave more questions then answers. This movie lacks that as you get more questions then you do answers. Found Footage movies should either go away or be made to look better then this bs! So i give this movie a F actually it is so bad it really doesn't deserve a grade",0
"No idea what's wrong with you people and low reviews. The acting was fine, convincing teenagers filming everything they do.I watch horror movies religiously and some of that scared the absolute crap out of me. I did make a few guesses during the film that turned out to be accurate and that's fine, I've seen enough of them to know how these things end but this had fab jump scares and movies don't need to be 'high budget' to be good.I wish I'd seen this film sooner than like 7 years after it was made!",0
"The found footage genre is really odd one.I seen to number of them , I liked a lot of them but I hated few of them else And there are some feel are OK.If we the gallows falls in the hated pile, when I first saw the teaser Trailer at insidious 3, I thought it looked and sound really good . But sadly that was not the case.The doing play on stage but some goes wrong when is accidentally hung on stage.The the movies onto modem time and people getting ready for the same play But the football player who is really bad actor on stage (and off stage as well)They break into school at night and trash stage, then when movie Start to up, with the door that never locks , is locked!What this movie is missing is that that there was no atmosphere at all , I didn't find anything creepy or scary at all.Even the jump scene didn't work and I saw them coming a mile away.I didn't like how the movie ended , it was predicableI going to give this 2 out of 10",0
"In October of 1993, the students of Beatrice High School in Beatrice, Nebraska put on a play called ""The Gallows."" A last minute casting switch had an understudy playing the lead role, who's character was hanged before the townspeople at the conclusion of the play. Due to a horrific accident, shortly after the actor, named Charlie Grimille, slipped into the noose, a malfunction sent him through the floor beneath his feet, killing him almost instantly. Twenty years later, to honor the cast and the late Charlie Grimille, the students of Beatrice High School decide to resurrect the show, with a student named Pfeifer (Pfeifer Brown) directing the play.Former football star turned thespian Reese (Reese Mishler) has decided to take on the lead role this time around, much to the dismay of his father, who wanted him to continue football, and his pal Ryan (Ryan Shoos), who hangs around the set during rehearsals just to ridicule and belittle the castmates. Reese desperately wants to get close to Pfeifer, though his own stage fright and lack of acting abilities prevent him from being much more than just another body on stage in her eyes. In an attempt to win her affection by being there, Ryan hatches a misguided plan of breaking into the school one night through an unlocked door and destroying the set of the play before opening night, presumably resulting in an opportunity for Reese to console Pfeifer. Reese, Ryan, and Ryan's girlfriend Cassidy (Cassidy Gifford) go along with their asinine plan, breaking into the school late at night, but once they wind up meeting Pfeifer at the school, they encounter a barrage of paranormal activity and strange occurrences from what is believed to be Charlie's undead ghost.Such is the premise for ""The Gallows,"" the umpteenth rendition of the found footage genre, which I claimed to be ""uniformly dead"" following the release of 2012's ""The Devil Inside."" With ""The Gallows,"" a film made on a shoestring budget and released by Blumhouse, a known indie horror company, no new ground is broken but the ground that the film manages to chart is interesting, twisty, and a great deal of fun.I've always found high school/college drama rooms and theaters to be creepy places where one can find just about any old prop or relic. Seeing these locations captured with lowlit, dingy lightning only emphasizes their almost inherent eeriness. With ""The Gallows,"" we don't settle for creaky floorboards and shifty objects, but rather, detailed props and set designs of colonial periods that really intensify a feeling of discomfort. Being that there are only four characters, confined to the spacious setting of a theater-focused high school, there is a lot of room for which to roam and play around, which adds to the fun of the film.The writing/directing team of Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing also have fun toying with the visual possibilities of their setting. Consider the scene where they evoke an effect that almost communicates an optical illusion to the audience, showing a long, narrow hallway in the bowels of the school, captured in almost complete darkness, with the bottom half of the walls painted dark red. The visual effect makes it look like we, along with the characters, are wading through a thick, black sea of sorts, or are encapsulated into nothingness. These visual tricks, whether conscious decisions on part of the filmmaking team or fortunate occurrences, make for a film that is never visually boring, constantly finding ways to invigorate its setting.The videography and editing, while shaky, also works to help the film create this spooky atmosphere. The nauseating effects of found footage films are well known, and this year saw some of the shakiest videography the genre had yet to see in ""Project Almanac,"" which still wound up succeeding in my mind on a plethora of different levels despite its guerrilla filmmaking. The shakiness of ""The Gallows"" is never a real issue, for it continues to add to the suspense and Edd Lukas's cinematography, which is very fixated on the lowlit and the ominous.""The Gallows"" could've also fallen prey to the faults of ""As Above, So Below,"" last summer's low-budget horror effort, which failed largely in part because of its interchangeability in its execution. ""The Gallows,"" however, keeps things moving not only with a great setting but narrative twists and a persistency to show what other found footage films won't always show. We have multiple different camera perspectives, and once we see a character is doomed from one angle, we will eventually see the event unfold from his or her perspective and not just the one that closes us off from the events. So many found footage films leave us in the dark when it comes to the fate of the film's characters, figuratively and literally, but Cluff and Lofing seem to be sick of being left in the dark and, in turn, give us multiple different perspectives to show us what we wanted to see in the first place.If you're no fan of the found footage genre, ""The Gallows"" certainly won't make you one. It lacks the power of being the subversive piece of horror that the genre really needs now (look to films like Patrick Brice's ""Creep"" for that kind of quality). However, this is a film that does the very bare basics of the genre correctly, and with a budget of approximately $100,000, ""The Gallows"" finds itself stripped to the genre's minimum, forced to focus on narrative and the creepiness of its setting. This is the perfect horror outing that makes audiences active in the mystery and the looming ominousness of the story, rather than passive observers simply anticipating the next jump scare.",0
"THE GALLOWS is a low-fi found footage horror flick about a group of amateur dramatics students who end up trapped in a theatre one night, where they're haunted by the events of the past in which a student was accidentally hanged during a school play. It's one of those films which typically consists of a lot of screaming and a lot of running around through dark corridors. There's little in the way of special effects and the actors have to put a lot of work in to convince you of their fear, but they're generally not bad. On the downside, this is an entirely predictable outing and nothing that takes place hasn't been done better before. However, I still enjoyed it to a degree, as it's one of those amiable time-wasters that gets the job done.",0
"The positive thing about The Gallows is the fact that it was well promoted worldwide, you can find it in every shop selling flicks and all magazines were talking about this found footage flick. But the hype was a major let down for me. I can understand that teens will love this kind of horrors because there's the usual nerd loves cheerleader story and pranks being done until things go really wrong.Bur for me there wasn't any frightening moment or so typical with those found footage flicks a jump scene. And you have seen it all before, people levitating, being thrown in the air, the usual stuff.On part of the effects, it's well done but it's so low on horror that I even thought to push the stop button and go hang myself...Gore /5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5",0
"The teaser trailer for this film was great and I was looking forward to what looked like a savage and rather nasty horror film.Sadly I found The Gallows to be utterly tragic in every way. The film is another entry in the overcrowded found footage genre and the story's cameraman was obnoxious and idiotic right from the start.All the characters here are paper-thin and clichéd, they make stupid decisions to put themselves needlessly in peril.But generally there isn't much peril, or danger, or scares. Distractingly amateurish, The Gallows looked as if it was shot for fifty quid in a spare weekend.It's very annoying to pay a lot of money to see a film as awful as this in the cinema, because it's not even worth a rental.Avoid paying to see the full film and just watch the trailer for free, that way you won't feel robbed.",0
"During a High School performance of play The Gallows, one of the actors accidentally dies. Years later the school revives the play, and strange things happen when 4 students enter the school the night before the play is due to start.Yes, folks, it's another found footage horror film.I'll deliver the good news first – the high school play setting is novel.Now for the bad news. One, there isn't an ounce of originality here, apart from that setting. Two, the first half is anchored by the most profoundly annoying camera-wielding loudmouthed, A-hole: it's his fault the others are in this fix and – apologies for spoiler – thankfully he gets wiped out first, and it's a huge relief when he does. Three, this school has more hidden corridors, hideyholes, odd staircases etc. than your average mediaeval castle. Four, the basic premise of why the four of them are in the school is, let's say, flimsy at best. Five, there is a really lame twist ending. Six, the school decides to have a revival of a play in which one of the students died? Right. Seven, they have had a cast photograph of that ill-fated ensemble in the trophy cabinet ever since? Right. Eight, and one of the lads in the show has never recognised his Dad in that photo? Right.I don't mind it not making that much sense, but the final two thirds is creeping and running around in darkened corridors and spaces by the light of video cameras and mobile phones, with nothing much happening. Which is boring. I find that much more difficult to forgive.",0
"I have never been so angry leaving a cinema, I really disliked this film I have seen the same plot a million times and found footage has had its day in my opinion. The actors were terrible, there was so many plot holes after the ending. I was spending most of the time in the film saying to myself what will happen next and 90% of the time I got it right, such a clichéd film. Some of the acting was laughable to a point where I burst out laughing in the cinema. I was also surprised that the cinema was fairly packed I thought I as the only idiot to go see this film. I see films like this making over $18 million on a $100 thousand pound budget and then more and more of the same film comes out. I understand me watching it is feeding these films being made but nothing unique is coming out in the horror genre. Spend your time and money on other films, like 'It Follows' which came out this year a way better psychological horror or even Insidious 3 where they have much better intense moments. I would give it a 3/10 only because I admire that they tricked so many people to think it would be a good film by the trailer.",0

"The Gallows documents a conniving high school student who convinces his jock friend — a bad actor starring in the school play— to trash the set before opening night in order to sabotage the production; along for the ride is his girlfriend. Things get progressively messy when they are interrupted by the play's female lead who comes to investigate, and they find themselves locked inside the school with the vengeful ghost of a student who died onstage in the same play twenty years before.Where do I even start? As everyone knows, this is a ""found footage"" movie, widely abhorred and widely berated by hardcore genre fans and casual moviegoers alike. Make no mistake, ""The Gallows"" brings zero to the table in terms of innovation in regard to the sub-genre— but honestly, what more innovation could be had? ""The Blair Witch Project"" essentially set the standard over fifteen years ago, and more or less, every post-millennial found footage horror attempt is toiling in its wake. We know this. Critics know it. And yet, these films are still trending nearly two decades later. Why? Well, because some of them do work the formula well, even if it's absolutely silly. ""The Gallows"" is one of these. The actors do senseless things, the camera is always inexplicably rolling, and yet we're still watching, either shaking our heads or enjoying the ride. Technical presentation aside, what I think I found appealing about the film was its use of setting— an old high school after dark. A motif that goes back to the 1980s, we have a bunch of teenagers running amok inside a high school (which by virtue is spooky at night), tormented by an attacker— here, it's a supernatural one. The film is traditional in that sense, and almost plays out like a supernatural slasher flick, and the noose and stage plot devices are definitely different from the norm.The typical use of shadows, noises, and bumps galore are utilized to their full extent here, and were even able to get a couple of jolts out of my jaded genre lover's body. A particularly stunning sequence bathed in red light, which appears on the film's poster and as the staple of its advertising campaign, was one of the most craftily-orchestrated scenes I've seen in a horror film this year. The acting is overall pretty good, especially for a cast of young unknowns. Amateurish at times, but overall very serviceable, particularly the two female leads. The ending of the film is admittedly absurd and follows the found footage formula to a T— for that I do have to knock it a bit. This could have ended with a bit less fluff and been all the better for it.Overall, ""The Gallows"" is an enjoyable flick. It is not innovative or refreshing in the slightest, but it plays up its best qualities for maximum effect, and it's engaging and at times surprisingly thrilling in spite of filling its found footage shoes. There are some throwback elements as well that recall slasher traditions of the eighties, which may be a major reason that I inexplicably enjoyed the film no matter how silly it was or became. A fun, contrived ninety minutes. 6/10.",0
"Unsurprisingly, this movie has gotten a lot of hate around the internet. With a 4.7 on IMDb based on only 164 ratings, a 16% on rotten tomatoes and a 31 on metacritic, you'd expect this to be a complete disaster. Fortunately, The Gallows is a surprisingly intense and effective little found footage flick that has a few good scares up its sleeve. The Gallows is a supernatural found footage film about a group of teenagers who break into their school the night before a play, appropriately titled ""The Gallows"", so that the show can't go on. However, 20 years earlier, a freak accident happened during the same play that resulted in the death of Charlie Grimelle, the star of the show. For the most part, this film is rather tight and controlled. Clocking in at a criminally short 81 minutes, this does allow the movie to move at a pretty brisk pace, but a few scenes do feel rather rushed. Some of the scares do fall flat because of this and go for a jump scare that would have been much more effective if there wasn't a ""big whoosh sound"". Other than those few scenes, there are quite a few well- timed jump scares and a lot of incredibly intense and scary scenes that, luckily, don't end on a dramatic jump scare. Watching the four characters roaming the dark, empty corridors of their school is rather unnerving, especially when they find hidden rooms underneath the school. The sound also makes this movie very atmospheric and unsettling. The Gallows isn't without its glaring problems. This movie definitely won't win any awards in the originality department, and the acting (something I usually never mention) is largely uneven from a couple of the cast members, but the worst thing about The Gallows is the atrocity that is the ending. I don't want to spoil anything, but the big plot twist at the end was insanely predictable and cheesy. It was almost as if the filmmakers couldn't come up with a decent way to end the movie, so they just wrapped it up with some lame plot twist that makes no sense at all. That might have been why this was only 81 minutes. The worst thing about the ending is that it actually created more questions than it answered, which really frustrated my friend and me. Despite the absolutely awful ending, The Gallows does not deserve the scorn it's been getting on the Internet. It's a very intense and sometimes scary movie, and it's definitely a movie you'll want to watch in the theater.",0
"As one of the most marketed horror films of 2015, The Gallows was strictly made to pick up money from teen audiences. The story revolves around a drama class at high school and drama between characters. The story is set up terribly making no sense at times and the characters were unlikable and had terrible dialogue. The writing was awful from the start. Besides the found footage technique which wasn't really needed, there is an element of originality with some of the concepts so I'll give it points for that. However, the film crashed for good once the ending rolled along, it was just terrible. Skip The Gallows unless you're looking for a movie with lots of jump scares or something to laugh at with your friends at the films absurdity.",0
"*** review contains spoilers*** worst movies of (2015) well the first time when i saw the trailer it looked so scary dark and red intense Most of the time we're treated to feet treading floors, epileptic hand-held cameras prowling creepy passages, and dramatic lapses when the characters avert the cameras from the action. Unfortunately, sound of horror movie and also i like the ideas of movie but then when it turned out to be one of worst movies i have ever seen no likable characters let me tell everyone i am done with found footage movies they even don't go for long as 81 minutes long it was little longer then Unfriended but unless it was better movie then this. and no likable characters in movie, completely one of idiots in movie acting is very terrible very terrible theyneeded to go drama school more they were worst actors and characters in movie they could got someone else in but even the movie is boring half way i was bored completely i wasn't scared expect for when it was dark and felt same way it was scary Plot: 20 years after a horrific accident during a small town school play, students at the school resurrect the failed show in a misguided attempt to honor the anniversary where Charlie Grim is student who did the play then got hanged in stage then later on it still goes on 2013 then these stupid characters(Ryan shoos)Ryan was such pointless, idiot pointless character making himself number 1 idiot front of people at school and specially stage in movie even such a worse movie i have ever saw and he was with friends with Reese and Cassidy specially they find Pfeifer Ryan wanted trash the play down not respecting the place when someone died ? hello does this person has to be respected no wonder why these characters had no personalty bullying Reese to this especially his girlfriend got angry when he destroyed theater for noting she got very disappointed to Reese but Ryan made him to say yes to go with him at school and destroy the play ? thought he can get away i thought the doors were locked that was never locked, they could smashed windows or smash the doors down but somehow why don't they don't try to call cops with there IPHONE could of called cops try but they don't. Cassidy boyfriend to Ryan she doesn't have brain Reese said don't leave the door when Ryan was screaming like little girl. she keeps running out to yell help and door keeps locking like they can't get out smash it down find something before that scene when they said trash the school Cassi wanted to change her mind clean the stage and fixing stage said i am fixing the stage ? you go there for noting just go home her boyfriend got everyone killed especially Reese wasn't that bad but he still did wrong thing agrees Ryan for noting. and even the girl he liked girl and ruined the stage killing i thought it was lame death scenes all the characters got hanged because it's called gallows they don't die different way lame every different horror kills them the different way but this just hanging, the title of gallows is lame name i liked the trailer all staff but movie was going to be titled stage fright witch has better name apart from using boring name the gallows witch sounds like boring name it's only 1 Gallow there's not many gallows title should of named the Gallow that's it. movie was going on since 2012 even Ryan making things a lot worse for all his friends got them in danger but i wish he's friends said no that's it got all his friends killed in movie the thing is all actors are so bad like i can't stand it i always think about leaving the theater this movie wasn't scary at all it was just worst story, i love idea of movie with darkness how scary it was i like found footage films but this killed it the all thing no point of making it :/ some of scenes are very scary and dark i like idea of movie with scary is haunted and all that but this with gallows and another crap was like what ? but the trailer didn't had same scenes in movie i can't remember witch ones but then some how movie didn't do much there's not much too say i am glad this movie got 4.5 very short story line like grade 3 kid had written this movie, movie needs to be more to be scary, more of running around the all school surviving but ending killed it there's not much to write about all plot it mean to watch movie goes for 91 minutes no need for to write plot for this review. gallows needed to be 2.1 least and even this movie should have went to DVD the movie budget think's it is made more then Paranormal Activity ? least Paranormal Activity is $28.015 million and Unfriended 1 million still didn't noting like gallows got $100,000 from what did they got budget from toilet ? boy i would have done better movie then this better characters , better plot, much scary then this ? 1.10 one of worst movies in 2015 worst acting ever and ending killed it with cops i rather watch cops or end of watch. BEST HORROR MOVIE IT FOLLOWS",0
"I love found footage horror when it's done well, and there's a lot to choose from, and a lot of it sucks. So when I see one that doesn't have me cringing and eye-rolling from start to finish, I give it a break.The Gallows moves along quickly, the storyline mostly makes sense and is engaging enough, the characters are identifiable, typical and even likable, and the ending was somewhat original and unexpected, so to me, this is worth a viewing.The majority of bad reviews seem to be from people who already hate found footage, so it's hard to give those reviews any credence. But if you are like me and enjoy found footage horror, and understand going in that most of those films are pretty bad, then this film is for you.",0
"Most of the time I'm against, or rather tired of found footage type horror films. Earlier this year, Unfriended came out. I saw it and I truly enjoyed it. When I first saw the teaser trailer for this, I didn't really know what to expect. When the real trailer was released, it looked a lot better. I saw this film yesterday, and I also truly enjoyed it, almost as much as Unfriended. It was short, scary, creepy and to the point. I can't believe it's getting such bad ratings. As long as I feel scared by the atmosphere, the lighting and shadow of the ghost, the jump scares, the tension, and if the ending is good, then I'm happy with it. Just the thought of going to an abandoned dark school at night, being locked in by a supernatural presence, and being stalked and killed is a very scary concept to me. In 1993, the drama class of Beatrice High School is performing a play called 'The Gallows' Near the end of the play, a boy named Charlie is set to be hung at the gallows. A freak accident happens when the door beneath Charlie's feet opens and he falls through with a noose around his neck, killing him and traumatizing the whole school. In 2013, a new group of students are finally going to remake the play the way it was meant to be seen as a tribute to Charlie. The man behind the camera is Ryan, going around the school and filming his friends as they rehearse and prepare for the play the next day. Ryan's friend, Reese is set to play the part Charlie had. Reese has a crush on the girl wanting to redo the play named Pfeifer. Ryan soon comes up with an idea to break into the school at night, and destroy the sets so the play can't go on. They soon realize every school has its spirit when Charlie himself comes back from the dead and begins stalking and killing them all in the dark and deserted school. In conclusion, I really thought this was a decent little horror flick that deserves some more attention. It's miles better than Paranormal Activity. I highly recommend THE GALLOWS!!!",0
"Watching Artemis Fowl is like listening to someone read a complicated instruction manual at a very quick pace, without pausing to allow for questions or reflection. I get that they had to cram a lot of story into one 90-minute movie, but it just doesn't make any sense. Artemis is unlikeable, Mulch Diggums is annoying, I felt embarrassed for Dame Judi Dench, and the rest of the cast is forgettable. If you're interested in this story, skip the movie and read the books.",0
"Before I watch this movie I had heard people say it was pretty bad but I knew it was based on a book so I thought people may have hated it because it didn't live up to it. This isn't the case it is just a bad movie.It is so boring and like aimless. To top that off it is also really nonsensical and confusing. I don't feel like I watched the movie because I couldn't tell you anything about it, it's just like a blur.The acting was pretty bad and I don't know why but when I was watching it I just got this like early 2000s vibe from it and I don't know why. Like I think this would have done better if it was made then. It just had that type of feel.The writing was also pretty bad too. It is never good when a movie doesn't make you want to read the book it's based on.So skip it it's pretty bad",0
"It's actually been a long time since reading the book series, but from retrospect they were certainly better than this film version. Love Disney and Disney+ has been a godsend recently and watched regularly actually, one of many reasons as to why my reviewing here has slowed down. Kenneth Branagh is a gifted director, absolutely love his Shakespeare adaptations with 'Much Ado About Nothing' being a personal favourite (though others will prefer the also great 'Hamlet' and 'Henry V'). Love Judi Dench as an actress too.'Artemis Fowl' was a real disappointment. As an adaptation it's an abomination, one of the worst book to film adaptations there is in existence. Am not kidding here. It fares even worse on its own terms, despite what those that have defended the film say some that have hated the film have not read the books and saw it as fans of Branagh and Dench, my parents being among those people. Almost nothing works and Branagh has never been this uninterested in his directing in what is easily his worst film (those that disliked 'Murder on the Orient Express', didn't care for that myself while not hating it, will appreciate that film better after seeing this).The least bad asset is actually the music score, which is actually beautiful to listen to, authentically Irish and lilting. Sadly it was one of those scores that were pleasant enough on their own but failed to fit within the film, this score sounded like it belonged somewhere else. The scenery also wasn't bad in parts but the photography generally is rushed looking and some of the images thanks to some very disjointed editing and garish lighting are quite ugly so that was wasted too. Any special effects are afterthought-looking.Moving on further onto the criticisms, the acting is really not good. Ferdia Shaw is monotone and charisma-free throughout. Lara McDonnell has more perkiness but the character is very underwritten and bland on the whole. Colin Farrell is completely wasted. Josh Gad tries too hard is gets very annoying after a while, actually thought he didn't blend very well with everything else. You know something is wrong when Dench gives the least bad performance and still manages to give one of her worst performances, that affected accent and voice was not needed and she doesn't look engaged at times. At least she showed some signs of having command over her meagre material.Branagh was clearly not interested in the material, as his direction throughout is uncharacteristically indifferent and phoned in. One would not think that he is a great Shakespearean director, and he did prove with his wonderful 'Cinderella' that he could do non-Shakespeare too, as this is quite inept. The target audience also felt confused, my mother was very unsure at who 'Artemis Fowl' was aimed at, children will find it hard to follow and it is too dull for adults. Even teens, the main target audience of the book series, will question the target audience.Script is stilted and is too exposition-heavy (apparent right from the beginning with an over-explanatory narration), a lot of the film screeching to a deadening halt in the more talky sections and there are a lot of those. The storytelling is incredibly thin and not does it feel like a hodge podge of cobbled togther ideas it is all executed in a dull fashion and with little coherence, literally only one event happens. There is one action show-piece pretty much with a troll very late on but even that doesn't thrill and even the troll doesn't look that good. There is no character development whatsoever, nobody is given time to breathe, the villain is a non-entity and Artemis himself is practically useless. What little there is of the action is sluggish, incoherently edited and the sense of danger just isn't there. To cap it all off, the ending was a completely abrupt anti-climax.In summary, very poor. 2/10",0
"Fans of the books will be immensely disappointed as this movie changes everything, and not in a good way (think a wrinkle in time, percy jackson, or mortal engines). If you're going to rewrite the plot, it should at least be entertaining and make sense.However, not only is this a bad adaptation, it is also a bad movie in general. You're not going to attract any new fans by pumping 90% of your budget into CGI, and then glossing over your characters and screenplay. Absolutely no one is going to say ""I liked this movie, now let me check out the books.""It used to mean something when you saw the disney castle at the beginning of a movie. Now it just means the movie you are about to see is going to be a disaster.",0
"You ever watch a movie and then realise that the writes think they are clever but actually they are not?It's one of those moments in this movie where they are not even trying to write intelligent dialog, it's meaningless scenes that are pretending to be meaningful.If this is what Disney is producing now you might as well give up on them. I canceled my Disney plus subscription after watching this, because if they are promoting this as being ""good"" then there is no trust left in Disney.Want to watch something good from Disney? Go back at least 5-10 years before the rot set in.",0
"This movie succeeds in being bad for those who haven't read the books, like me, and especially for those who have, like my wife. We crawled to the finish line of this movie, which we couldn't wait to be over. I was so lost. And why is everyone talking like their throat itches? And what does Artemis Fowl ACTUALLY do?!",0
"Artemis Fowl is a complete disaster right from the start. A hectic and frustrating 94 minute movie with no emotions, weak CGI and an incoherent screenplay. It's awkwardly staged, with rusty dialogues that is unexplainable and unacceptable.A movie made out of a long series of books, Artemis Fowl is bland and incoherent, with paper-thin character development, unimaginative world building, and an awful story telling. Kindly skip this and watch some old Disney classics instead. My Rating : 0.5/5",0
"Truly an awful film. Scraps literally all the charm and myth of the book and misses every mark that would be necessary for even a decent film. The tone is confused, the scene direction is 10/10 for cringe. All those years of Shakespearean study and practice was a waste of time Kennith? Clearly. Packed with all the muddled and addled virtue signalling nonsense that you could ever need. It not only defuses any sincerity about the characters but also manages to destroy any possible tension. We seem to be in a place in film making where it is taboo and forbidden for anyone to represent negative qualities of any kind. Everyone is good and nice to each other except for characters hidden in cloaks or the colonial British man.Josh Gads narration is not only entirely unnecessary but delivered like a high school students first assessment project.Holly is wrecked. Root is wrecked. Foaley is nothing. Mulch is intolerable. Butler is wrecked. Juliet is nothing.0 tension. 0 nuance. 0 technique.It may be the worst adaption of a book I've ever seen. Definitely at least in the top 5.",0
"Okay, so I watched this movie and it was awful. It could be ok to watch it if you're like 6 yo, but that's it! Although I'm not famliar with the books, I found this movie pretty confusing and disappointing. Also, second-class Hagrid played by Josh Gad (can't stand this actor), comon guys?! I really hope the next Disney movies and TV shows are gonna be better than that, and especially the Marvel TV shows.... Haven,t seen a good original Disney movie for a while now... Or maybe am I just too old?",0
"This has been a strange year for new movies. From studios releasing some of their anticipated films early on-demand to straight-up selling the rights to streaming services, Disney must not have had faith in Artemis Fowl, but nobody thought twice about it going to their streaming service, due to theatres being closed anyways. Well, they have officially dropped their newest original film and I'll admit that I was mildly curious about seeing it since the first trailer. There's no beating around the bush here though, because this film is just really bad, all around. I'm not one to rip a movie apart, seeing how much work really goes into making them, but sometimes the end result is just too much of a mess to praise.With all the confidence in the world, young Artemis Fowl (Ferdia Shaw) makes it his mission to hunt down the magical fairies that kidnapped his father. I mean, that's the set-up of the film and all, but this movie takes far too many detours to really get a grasp on what's unfolding. The most annoying aspect of this movie is present for a lot of the duration as well. Mulch Diggums (Josh Gad) is a character that is front and center from the very beginning, even though he's very far from the main character. They choose to have him narrate at least a good 30 minutes of the film and it's not just to provide context. His narration is pretty much there to describe every detail of the characters and the plot they are in so that nobody misses anything. This movie treats the audience like very little children. On top of that, this movie gets so bogged down in other side plots that the narration becomes useless anyway.After watching Artemis Fowl, I had to do a double-take when I remembered that Kenneth Branagh had directed it. Although I wasn't a huge fan of his rendition of Murder on the Orient Express a couple of years ago, I thoroughly enjoyed his work on movies like Thor and the live-action remake of Cinderella. His direction has always been strong to me, and I could be wrong here, but there's no way that he had the final say on a lot of this final cut. Over a year ago there was a trailer for this movie and a lot of the footage seen in that trailer was clearly from a different movie. This is yet another movie that has fallen victim to the studio pushing the filmmakers in many of the wrong directions.For the most part, the visual effects are definitely worthy of a mainstream theatrical release, but they made the movie also feel more childish than the story really was. In addition to that, I'm really not sure who this film is supposed to be aimed at. Obviously it was made for kids in hopes to start a franchise for them, but I don't see many kids being able to follow this film from start to finish. They will have many questions for their parents and I fear that the movie will be so uninteresting for them, that they won't even know how to explain it. This is a complete mess of a story that was taken apart and pieced together multiple times in the editing room, so I'm not even sure who's most at fault for this one. I don't want to single out a particular department here, but I would be fascinated to see a behind-the-scenes documentary for this movie.Overall, Artemis Fowl is a film that starts out as a Spy Kids rip-off but very quickly becomes this overdone film, which reminded me of how I felt about Jupiter Ascending, but honestly even more of a mess. I could see some solid elements of family trying to jump out of this movie, but anything worth noting is buried too deep to notice. I've never seen young Ferdia Shaw act before, but I hope he is given some smaller roles after this to improve himself because I believe his acting abilities were not to the calibre that a movie of this size requires. Even some of the musical cues in some of the more dramatic moments felt like epic pieces that belonged in an adventure or action sequence. Everything about Artemis Fowl just feels off and I was both uninterested and frustrated pretty early on. Even though it's available to stream if you have Disney+, I still can't recommend it.",0
"The movie centers around Artemis Fowl, a child prodigy who also claims to be a criminal mastermind. The story is narrated by a rather large dwarf named Mulch Diggums who is being interrogated. Artemis Fowl's dad has been kidnapped and he goes on a quest with his servant, Domovoi Butler and a fairy he captures, Holly Short. He and his crew are confronted by the other fairies as they try to reach a conclusion that will help them reach their goals.So Artemis Fowl is Disney's latest sci-fi family blockbuster. It is based on Eoin Colfer's novel of the same name. What is odd about the film is the fact that Disney decided to send it straight to Disney+. Disney did not even try to find another theatrical release date for this film despite having a budget of $125,000,000. I decided to watch it today and after seeing, ooh boy, I now know why Disney made this decision...Artemis Fowl is an absolute disaster of a film. Just about every element of the movie falls flat. The story is barely a story. There are a couple of interesting elements here such as the fairies' ability to wipe out memories and stop time, but it is not explained and it comes off as unoriginal more than anything. The biggest problem with the movie is that it is incoherent and that it is an ""adventure"" film that pretty much takes place in one setting: Artemis' house. Artemis does not go anywhere else until the end of the movie and it is only to wrap up the thin plot. The world building could have been good, but it is sloppily executed which makes the world feel shallow. The movie cannot decide whether it wants to be campy or serious and it fails at both. The characters are terrible too. Artemis Fowl is such an unlikable protagonist that has that attitude where he thinks he is better than everyone. He belittles Holly when he captures her for no other reason aside from gloating about how he is better than her... and that is our incredibly likable hero. I heard that in the novel that he is supposed to be the villain, but movie never treats him like a villain at all. He makes up with Holly in the most forced way possible and they suddenly become good friends after just few minutes. Artemis and Holly have absolutely no chemistry with the performances or with the characters. They just suddenly become friends because... the plot requires it? Speaking of performances, I just want to say I feel so bad for Ferdia Shaw who played as Artemis Fowl. He is trying his best, but his performance is just dreadful. It is just painful to watch and his performance is definitely on the crew that failed him. It's actually his first role and it definitely shows. I hope that he will shine in another project some day, particularly one that is more competent than this. The supporting cast is not much better. Colin Farrell is completely wasted on one of the most thankless roles I have ever seen as Artemis' dad. He gets nothing to do. Why go through the trouble of casting Farrell if you're not going to use him? Lara McDonnell is okay as Holly Short, but her character is just the generic action girl with no interesting traits. Judi Dench is easily the standout as Holly's commanding officer, but she can only do so much with the dreadful material that gives her little to work with. Josh Gad plays as the comic relief and narrator, Mulch Diggums. Admittedly, he seems to be having a lot of fun in the role and he got some chuckles out of me, but the narration was rather pointless. In fact, most of the narration is boring exposition that explains to the audience what the plot of the film is. They also do something really stupid with his character in the middle of the film. Nonso Anozie plays as Artemis' servant and he pretty much phones it in the entire time. His character is just completely indifferent and flat. The cast is not the biggest problem with the film, but no one can save the material they have to work with. I mentioned that the film had some humorous moments and aside from a couple of scenes that made me regrettably chuckle and one particular scene that put a smile on my face, most of it falls completely flat. It feels so tone-deaf and amateurish. I honestly thought at the beginning that the film could be so bad that it's good, but it quickly became really boring. There are some unintentionally funny moments of dialogue, but for the most part, the film is just painful to watch. The climax in the film is just awful. Not only is it incredibly anti-climatic, but the twist for it is dumb.Despite having a huge budget, the movie looks incredibly cheap for 2020. The CGI is atrocious in this film. None of it looks believable or even pleasant. The fairy designs look ugly, the water effects look like something that would come from an PlayStation 2 game and the fairy world looks terrible. It is some of the worst looking effects I have seen in a blockbuster film. The only thing that looked good were the ships that the fairies traveled in. The set designs look better and there are parts of the fairy world that look imaginative, but it's buried under the poor CGI effects for the most part. The action scenes are badly shot and edited. The camera work during the fights is shaky at best and there are too many jump cuts in these scenes. Even then, none of the action is memorable or entertaining. It's just uninspired visual noise. The costume designs and makeup look okay, but their nothing special. The cinematography does feature some really good shots, but it also has some of the most choppy use of slow motion I have ever seen. Also, there is a scene near the climax that legitimately made my head spin and not because it was thrilling. The musical score is not the best in the world, but at least it is pretty decent. They fit the set pieces nicely and it is mostly pleasant to listen to while you are listening to it.Artemis Fowl is a horrendous sci-fi adventure flick on its own right and I doubt that it is any better as an adaptation of the novel. I know that this was made for kids, but that is not an excuse for this movie be as bad it is. It sucks because I would like to see more action-adventure films that are made for younger audiences, but they also deserve something a lot better than this. If you are looking for a live-action blockbuster film that the whole family can enjoy, skip this movie and there are much better options such as The Jungle Book remake, Detective Pikachu, Chronicles of Narnia, Sonic the Hedgehog or the National Treasure films. Those are all much better than this. Between this and Cats, I think it is safe to say that Judi Dench should probably fire her agent.",0
"Never read the books so im not judging as an adaptation, but that was pretty bad. Lazy use of a narrator, tons of bad expodumping, and pretty boring characters. No emotional moments because I just genuinely didnt care about the characters. left a bad taste in my mouth /:",0
"Artemis Fowl (1.5 out of 5 stars).Artemis Fowl is a pretty horrible fantasy adventure film that is based on a novel of series. Sure, it is the beginning and the end of a movie series. For a movie with a big budget, it is surely wasted and not sure where it went. The script is terrible and wasted with so much going with the story crammed in such a short running time. The plot is a mess. And the whole setting of the movie takes place with the fairies army invading Artemis house by the beach. The movies narrative structure by Josh Gad was just plain stupid. And annoying. The performances are tedious and bad. There was no emotional connections with the characters. The villain is undeveloped. And no explanation to the bad guys motive. The action sequences are boring. The visual effects seemed incomplete and cheesy. The direction by Kenneth Branagh is a complete wreck with this film. From the director that did Thor and Murder on Orient Express. This movie sure fails to entertain. I do wonder how would this film even be in theatres cause it definitely felt like a straight to TV movie with its quality. I do recommend to save your time and skip this film.",0
I felt nauseous while watching it. I want a personal apology from the frozen head of Walt Disney.,0
"I've been a fan of Artemis Fowl for years. When I saw the trailer, I was, of course, furious. My brother, another fan, watched the whole film, while I didn't get very far. He said it got worse. I believed him and only wasted 9 minutes and 6 seconds of my life. In less than ten minutes there are numerous errors. For example, Artemis doesn't surf. The therapy scene is from the second book. That Mulch stuff? Nope. From my understanding, it would also be a bad movie on its own, without the shame of being a shoddy adaptation.",0
"The story was all written out for you, this day in age it really shouldn't be that difficult to take a fantasy story such as this and adapt it to the big screen. So many creative libraries were taken with this story, you are basically telling a different story. Might as well have changed the title too.",0
"This movie seems like it was written by someone who read the Wikipedia for this book series but never actually picked up the books. When making a movie based on a book, there are liberties that have to be taken because some things can't translate from the book and some effects (like the size of the fairies) are a hard to produce without costly CGI. However this movie doesn't seem to care about using CGI, and even uses it effectively but uses it in all the wrong places. The biggest issue with this movie is not the complete changing of story line but the betrayal of every single character's base traits for what appears to be no real reason. If you never read the books, this movie is passable, but if you're a fan of the series, prepared to see a torpedoing of all your beloved characters.",0
"If Disney put half the effort into the movie as they did into making a trailer and promotion, Artemis Fowl might have been only horrible instead of nauseatingly unwatchable. Thanks to the other 1 star reviews I will be reading the books so I can understand exactly how badly they dropped the ball. My kids and I haven't been this disappointed since the Last Airbender movie M. Night butchered.",0
"Hey Disney did you even read the books before coming up with a script?!? 20 minutes and 3 seconds is all I could handle. Utter disgrace to this phenomenal book series! I'm soo upset you've done this! Infuriatingly disappointing. 1. Mulch does not narrate the books so wtf is that about?!? No narrator is needed if you followed the damn book. He would also never say anything about magic or fairies to the police/government!!! Like seriously?!? Major foundation of the entire series is that the Mud People (humans) have no idea The People (fairies) exist....except for Artemis and the Butler... because he's a sneaky, genius, wealthy, law breaking teen. 😤 2. Why are they talking about his mom like she's dead - she's not. Just crazy every since dad disappeared. 3. ARTEMIS DOESN'T SURF! 4. EVERYONE CALLS BUTLER, BUTLER!!! Artemis has no idea what his first name is until later books for a specific reason. I'm not going to continue watching this because I can only imagine the further mistakes you've made and that would be even more upsetting to me. I've been a fan of this series for years now. Breaks my heart. You ruined the Percy Jackson books by Rick Riordan as well. Nothing nice to say - you've wasted your money making this horrific nightmare. Did you even include Eion Colfer?!?!",0
"I haven't been this disappointed with a book turned movie since they tried to force us to accept that Jack Reacher shrunk 12"" in height and lost 100 lbs. This begs the question of, how far should one be allowed to change characters and deviate from plot lines while still being allowed to use the name of the book or character which the story is supposed to be derived from?If you loved the books, just stick with them as this loose interpretation coupled with rollercoasteresque cinematography really is a travesty to the story line.While a few of the actors are always outstanding because it's just their nature to be so, they alone couldn't save the film. Credit due to makeup, costuming and special affects artistry because they did a great job as well however you couldn't always appreciate the efforts with the camera spinning like it was placed upon a top.I'm deliberately not including spoilers because people who don't know Artemis may enjoy this different story",0
"I have no words to the describe the story of this movie, actually doesn't exist. No Comment!",0
"Why Hollywood thinking it's a right to destroy any fantasy book? why they can't understand fantasy books are serious? by making this garbage, you don't making just a bad movie. you ruin the memory of this book.",0
"My 10 and 13 year old loved this book series - the antihero vibe, the magical element. When Branagh and crew opted not to be faithful to the books, they made a calculated risk: piss off the fans and create something more accessible for the masses. Unfortunately, if our house is a useful test case, everybody pretty much thought it sucked. My kids disliked it because it ""ruined the books."" I disliked it because it felt like a paint by numbers Disney adventure with horrible (gravelly?) voiceover narration by Josh Gad. In trying to make something for everyone, they made something for nobody. When Artemis called himself a ""criminal mastermind"" towards the end, we all literally laughed. Nothing about this film established his character or the story. Instead, we were told about everything...the world, the people, why it mattered. Show don't tell is rule #1, and this movie broke it. Artemis Foul, indeed.",0
This movie is the definiton of money grab. They took the name Artimis Fowl and the base idea from the books and threw everything else out. This movie is garbage.,0
"Did the writers actually read the books, or did they just skim the pages and jot down the characters? The special effects were brilliant, but wasted. I enjoyed the Irish accents and Artemis is adorable. However:1) His mom becomes a more important part of the story, so why did they have her be dead?2) His dad never made an appearance in the book, but yet they had him featured quite a bit in the movie. I guess they needed an easier transitional plot to introduce Opal?3) What were they thinking when they adapted Butler? He is literally called Butler in the majority of the books, since part of his training was making his first name a secret.4) Artemis is not vulnerable like this movie portrays. He is calm, cunning, and calculating.5) Why is Mulch so large and why is that made part of his character insecurity? It has literally NOTHING to do with the story.6) The thing with Holly's dad? Why did they create that? The ENTIRE point of the oak tree was for the ritual to recharge her magic, and was the only reason Artemis was able to capture and keep her. And that stupid device to somehow block her magic?7) They made the entire movie about a device that wasn't in the first book, let alone ever in the Fowl's manor.8) With the troll part and with Butler dying and being brought back, I understand they needed something more cinematically climactic than what happened in the book.9) Why did they bring Juliet into the first movie?I understand making some changes for movies, but they took too much creative license with this. What a shame.",0
