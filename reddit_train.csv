0,"Melissa gives easily the best performance of her career, one that is absolutely worthy of an Oscar nomination, maybe more than just that.  But Richard E Grant stole every scene and if he isn’t nominated for Supporting Actor I will fucking riot. The film is unbelievably good. Such a fantastic surprise. Also features a great Paul Simon song - Can’t Run But I was so surprised by this movie. It's not so much a biopic as a deeply empathetic look at loneliness. This is easily Melissa's best performance which is too bad because she's blown out of the water by Richard E. Grant. He nailed a certain kind of gay man that died off during the AIDS crisis. He was so lively yet such a tragic figure who wouldn't let that define him. And just in general it was perfect at representing the struggles of being older and queer and feeling the community leave you behind.",0
1,"Also it was so interesting how Lee was the architect of her own destruction. That scene at the end of the date where Anna goes in for a kiss and she refuses her is so tragic. She knows she damages people but she can't help wanting to feel love. What a brutal character moment in a single scene.  Richard Grant was the best part of this movie, not that Melissa McCarthy wasn't amazing as well. I absolutely loved this film! For me, 2018 has been a highly disappointing year for movies (but I shouldn't complain, since 2017 was my personal favorite year in film). I have to say, Can You Ever Forgive Me? is my favorite film of the year. I really wanted to cry when Lee's cat died. Melissa is terrific, and I loved her friendship with Jack. Lovely cinematography and some comedy thrown in. Great film!!! This was a good movie, I really liked it. Mccarthy and Grant are amazing!! The scene where she finds the cat almost made me cry.  Both Grant and McCarthy have great chances of being nominated at the Oscars but especially at the globes. Best performance of McCarthy career and I'm not a big fan of her but I loved her performance. ",0
2,The whole cat part of the film made me sad :(. I'm not even all the way through but had to pause to tell someone how much I love this movie already.,0
3,"The script really hits the spot, the acting is flawless, no masterful. I'm not quite feeling the pacing so far, but that's not all too much of an important thing to me anyway.",0
4,"The characters, and their relationships are magic. Really authentic. Almost as if I'd been there myself.",0
5,&#x200B;,0
6,"Kudos to everyone who made this such a special movie. Found this movie to be delightful! Reminded me of an old woody allen movie, and the writing of Holofcener was evident throughout.",0
7,Heller’s direction was wonderful here and she kept the pacing of the movie moving quite nicely.,0
8,"McCarthy was fantastic, as was Grant. He might be my favorite for supporting actor. Both Oscar noms were much deserved! Holy shit that last scene between Grant and McCarthy. Grant in that scene. You can see the battle between his life’s charade and his current illness right in his eyes. What an enjoyable movie. The more I think about it the more I enjoyed it. I kept hearing how this was Melissa McCarthy's serious role, but I also thought the movie was very funny and witty.",0
9,"I wasn't paying attention when she said the cat feeding directions. They focused on the cat food, did Jack follow the instructions Lee gave him?  That dinner scene between Lee and Anna really struck a chord with me. Can’t really explain why but it did. The scene that made me happiest in this movie was when she kicked her friend out of the apartment after she was told it smelled really bad and he still knocked on the door and offered to help clean up and that he didn't mind. It was very.....I don't l know, it just made me happy. Anyone knows name of the song sang by cross-dresser singer at the bar?",0
10,"Great Movie, BTW, capture the lonely mood really well. This was decent. I could easily see Grant & McCarthy nab up a bunch of nominations (and maybe even a Golden Globe win or two). ",0
11,"If anything, this is a reallllly good sign for the Mr. Rogers biopic with Tom Hanks next year. Marielle Heller's got insane potential. I loved this. McCarthy's performance was incredible, as was Grant's. The writing was great, too. Just delightful.  I've been wanting to see this, but our arthouse theater just got rid of it.  Damn!  That scene where she holds her dead can is fucking devastating. ",0
12,"The loneliness in this film is so palpable from the first five minutes, when she gets fired I would have liked to know more about Jack Hock - where he lived, his life, how he knew Israel...he's sympathetic and enjoyable thanks to Grant but he's also difficult to like b/c we know he gives Lee away and is at least somewhat responsible for her death. ",0
13,"I haven't read the book but I suspect he was even worse than Hock in the film, and much less charming than Grant. (Anyone who read the memoir know otherwise?) What did Grant mean when he said ""teeth are dead giveaway"" after he got his bleached?  Yeah this was the best acting I have seen from her, when she finds the cat awww.  I cried at this scene! ""Will you make me 29...""  He did. He broke every other rule, but he remembered to break up the pills in the food.  im with you here..  ",0
14,"the dialogue was spot on. i mean it was so authentic. im still confused if they were into each other or not and i felt all the insecurity and the questions and the what ifs and all that. amazing. Goodnight, Ladies. Originally by Lou Reed.",0
15,"Imagine getting court side seats to an eastern conference semifinals game and then 7 years later, a movie starring Adam Sandler comes out where he points to you in the broadcast footage and calls you a fat fuck. Can we just take a moment to praise KG in this film? He had more screen time than Lakeith Stanfield! I loved how Idina Menzel's character knew about all of Howard's antics from the get-go and we didn't have to see a drawn out breakdown of their marriage. y'all we just saw Adam Sandler fight The Weekend one of my favorite moments is when Howie is on the phone with his doctor and he says something like “Colon Cancer has cost me a lot of family” and the doctor says “Well colon cancer bought me a house in the Hampton’s” ",0
16,"There were quite a few good one liners here It hit me on the way home, right after they do the deed at the end and are smashing and stealing everything, the door is still missing the file. They can't get out of the jewelry shop without the door being fixed and they just shot the guy that fixed it before (where two others failed). Also, his wife was freaking out (about the trunk thing and weird phone call from earlier) and was about to call the cops. They didn't show you what happened, but they gave you everything you needed in the last few seconds to figure it out. Kevin Garnett should seriously act more ""I THOUGHT WE WERE THE CHOSEN PEOPLE"" is prob my favorite line of the year. I think this movie is secretly space jam 2 I want someone to want me as much as KG wanted the opal. This movie is a perfect example of how to build tension throughout a movie. ",0
17,"From the moment Howard is introduced, we see how tight of a rope he is walking. I don’t know how Sandler did it, but he elevated and already amazing story. The pace is so tight and the camera is right up in the actors face that you get everything. I want to know how the duck they filmed the kidnapping in the car. ",0
18,"Kevin Garnett was surprisingly really good. I mean, it’s not like an amazing performance, and I don’t know basketball or Garnett personally, but he really pulled it off, along with all the other actors. ",0
19,"This movie ties with the Lighthouse and Knives Out as my movie of the year. The whole movie definitely had this steady, building tension, but the scene where KG comes back with the Opal and they can’t get the door open while the phones are ringing and the camera is just panning around the jewelry shop really stepped on the gas. It felt like the movie didn’t let up from there, and when it finally was over I felt like I could finally breathe again.",0
20,"*edit* the fact that Howard’s tag was sticking out of his sweater the whole time was driving me CRAZY The moment he went and immediately pawned Garnett's ring nearly gave me an anxiety attack and that feeling didn't stop the whole movie. This shit was bananas and the ending left me speechless. Don't know if it's been mentioned much but the auction house lady on the phone is Tilda Swinton. And KG's manager, who he threatens to sue, is Natasha Lyonne. I loved how Arno from the trailers seemed like your run-of-the-mill pissed off gangster, but that wasn’t the case at all. ",0
21,"I was blown away when it's revealed he's Howard's Brother-In-Law and you can tell throughout the whole movie he kinda cares about him and took Howard's negligence to heart. It makes it more tragic on how he fucked up hiring those goons to scare Howard which eventually led to both of their deaths. [deleted] I really think Julia was the only character who actually loved Howard. She constantly defied my expectations, I figured she would be shoehorned into the gold-digger role. In a movie that depicts the corruption of wealth and the suffering that comes with it, she was a diamond in the rough ;) It seemed as Howard lived a pretty luxurious lifestyle between the big house in the suburbs, the apartment in the city, the Mercedes Benz and all the fancy jewelry he had. You would think that $100k isn’t really that big of a hole for someone like him. He could just sell off some assets and pay that off. He went through ALOT for only $100k including it costing him his own life I NEVER RESURFACED ANYTHING! Ah yes, my favourite psychedelic colonoscopy Was not expecting that ending but, looking back on it, that was the only way out for our boy Howard That final 20 minutes had me feeling like i had placed the bet on the celtics. Everytime KG scored i cheered.",0
22,"Masterclass film-making right there. Throughout the entire movie, I kept telling myself no way this has a happy ending. Then when he wins the bet, I was like how about that! Spoke too soon.. ",0
23,What a movie. Intense from start to finish. The ending was super effective and the perfect conclusion. Also an amazing way to utilize real past events for anyone who already knew the outcome of Sandler's bet.,0
24,"Reminded me a lot of 1974's ""The Gambler"" starring James Caan. Similar fitting ending for a difficult to like protagonist. This whole movie really impressed me, but the scene that I fell head over heels in love with was the ending when Sandler has the goons trapped in the glass box. That’s really clever writing. The fact that he’s got these people imprisoned but the threat is still squarely on him is a remarkable twist of tension and subversion of the typical rules of conflict. I had a smile on my face the whole time and really felt like I was witnessing some brilliant cinematic storytelling.",0
25,Lots of feelings for me.,1
26,"She used to be somebody, a member of a community that treated her as an equal. We see her meet the family in the store and realize that she is no longer part of their community. She is someone they have whispered about “are you homeless?” instead of calling on directly to ask how she is. ",1
27,She used to work in a place that she was proud of. She used to have a home that she loved and in which she felt at home. Now she is pooping in a van while people knock. She is in constant fear of being told to move on. ,1
28,"She used to own her space, it was her space. Now she is offered spaces that will never be hers. The only space that she can feel ownership of and be at peace in is nature, and her van. ",1
29,"If you have ever had the rug pulled out from under you, and you look back on what you used to have, what you used to be, the silent spaces will be completely filled. My favorite scene was when Swankie was telling Fern about all the amazing moments in her life that make her feel fulfilled. Her description was so vivid; she felt so alive. I was afraid she won’t be able to make it to Alaska, and almost cried when Fern saw the video she sent. I really, really liked it. What a beautiful little film about life, connection, the American struggle and how so many have been left behind/forgetten, and more.",1
30,"This is my first exposure to a Chloe Zhao film but I will definitley be seeking out *The Rider* now (and hoping she's allowed by Marvel to bring her own flair to *Eternals*). Beautiful cinematography of sweeping landscapes, fantastic score. There may not be much semblance of a plot as we typically know it, but I was enraptured nonetheless. Did anyone see the shitting into a bucket in IMAX? I wasn’t sure where the story was going and I was waiting for some kind of plot twist but I’m glad that never happened. I teared up a few times during this movie and it left me thinking all night about it. Some of my favorite imagery/directing I’ve ever seen. Some of those places made me really want to travel the country just for the fun of it.",1
31,"If you told me the lead actor was some random person off the street, I would have believed it. She did an amazing job and made the movie feel so human. It didn’t even feel like a movie is the thing- it felt like watching humans be humans. Watching what poverty and homelessness does to a person and how they cope with it. It never had any moments of “woah I never saw that coming” and I’m totally fine with that. Just human interaction and a look into a world that most people have probably never seen before. ",1
32,"I give this film a 4.5/5 easy and will be watching it again. Amazing movie [deleted] I get that the movie is actually literally repetitive and thus can get boring to watch, but every scene made sense to me and the movie is absolutely meaningful— It’s about Fern learning to cope with the grief of losing her husband and old life, and more broadly it’s about learning to accept loss and still finding meaning and beauty in the vast expanse of the world. Every experience Fern has in the movie allows her to piece together a way forward from the holding pattern that had her completely disconnected from her surroundings. For her, the nomad lifestyle turns from an escape to an embrace of the earth’s small treasures and the transient beauty of the human experience.",1
33,"Even though it’s like The Florida Project in that it’s about  “poverty”, I would say it’s more focused on the general concept of loss— loss of home, loss of loved ones, loss of meaning, loss of the American dream. It sort of made me think of synecdoche New York, just grounded in a ‘Florida project’ type world. I strangely am glad I didn’t get to see this in theaters and instead watched it on Hulu at home. What a perfect setting to watch a movie that makes you rethink the very definition of what it means to have a home. I've seen people be nominated for Oscars for far less than what Swankie gave us. I mean, even if this were the type of awards juggernaut that sweeps up every nomination it could plausibly get, I still don't think she'd be nominated. But her scene talking about the simple majesties of the natural world is one of my favorite moments on film in the past calendar year. ",1
34,"It was such a small role but so unbelievably potent, and she stuck with me through the film more than just about any other aspect outside Chloe Zhao's direction. I love the focus on objects in this film and how when you live a minimal lifestyle, the smallest things and the value a person puts into them can mean so much. When her plates that she emphasized early on break, it’s absolutely heartbreaking. The chair that Swankie gives to her is just a chair, but even after Swankie exits the movie, when ever you see that chair you think of her. The lighter she gives the kid and then when she sees him later, that's how she remembers him. ",1
35,"Because of the value people put into these objects, scenes like Swankie selling her stuff and Fern being unable to sell the van are just heartbreaking. When Swankie sells something to a passerby, she says, ""my grandmother made that, so take good care of it."" This object that has a history and meant the world to one person, is simply just a thing to someone else, until they put their own value to it. The fact that so much discussion here is about the director possibly being rich and how that would exclude her from telling a truthful story is such a aharp indicator of the level of discussion had in this sub. Very little conversation on the storytelling techniques, blend of docu-narrative, performances by non-actors or elements of light and framing. Just...she's rich and didn't deserve to tell this story. Fuck cancel culture and fuck anyone who comes to this conclusion based on rumors and devalues a beautiful story with TMZ level gossip. Fern, quoting her dad: “What’s remembered, lives.” Reveals that her husband Bo didn’t know his parents, nor did they have kids together.",1
36,"“I may have spent too much of my life remembering.” Hit me like a truck. I didn't like it. It's clearly a good movie, but I found myself more drawn to the directing than anything else.",1
37,"It almost seemed like a documentary. Using some real life nomads helped, I didn't know that beforehand but it seemed like they were telling stories more than acting.",1
38,"The visuals are great, the music was good, and Frances McDormand deserves her praise (that scene with the alligator was my favorite of her performance).",1
39,"But something about the movie seemed off for me, I found the beginning to be very difficult to get through and towards the end I started to appreciate the film, but it just wasn't for me.",1
40,"Maybe it's my mood, my mindset, or my pandemic brain? It's frustrating watching what you know is good filmmaking in many different ways but just not enjoying it. JEFF DANIELS: I'm the the star of the greatest sudden on-screen poop scene of all time!",1
41,FRANCES McDORMAND: Hold my flute. This film will really affect some and not others. ,1
42," Beautifully done, Frances McDormand was amazing in her immersion in to Fern.  It hits on many different angles: grief, economics, aging, pride, friendships, hardships, and beauty.  It is a peek in to an alternative lifestyle.  Whether forced or voluntary, this film resonates with those in this lifestyle or those seeking options.  There are so many stories that can be told, this was just one.  It doesn't explain a lot, but the film is one of those where you can feel 'in between the lines'.    ",1
43,"I may be biased, I have been there.  Have met a few of the nomads in the film, they are exactly how they appear, good people.  Hit the RTR a few years back, just a group of real people doing the best they can while sharing experiences and helping each other.  I am glad the film touched on this in a positive aspect.  Although nomads often feel alone, there is community out there.  I saw the beauty in this film. There were several moments in this where I just started crying. It’s a deeply emotional film that feels like it can resonate with damn near anybody, and it does so by really sneaking up on you in very natural ways. When she’s saying bye to her friend Linda and they hug was just UGH. Really loved everything about this movie. [deleted] I wish I could have enjoyed it as much as everyone else did but just couldn’t get into it. Couldn’t shake the feeling that with the quasi documentary nature of the film this wasn’t more than a vanity project for Frances with some poverty porn on the side. Very compelling stories that I would have loved to see in a documentary rather than this film. I enjoyed the film.  It kind of reminds me of The Florida Project in the way they tell the story of poverty.  It felt a little slow at the last 3rd, but a beautiful film overall. Just finished it. I have tears in my eyes and I'm not 100% sure why. I didn't want that to end. I could have watched that for the rest of my life. Would anyone be mad if McDormand won her third best actress Oscar for this? Because I wouldn't. She's perfect in everything and she blends in perfectly here. I was really looking forward to this movie.  I love Francis McDormand.  The movie felt like it was almost a documentary.  I found that having all these real Nomads and their stories in the movie mixed around Frances McDormand's fictional character to be really off-putting.  Like after each shoot, Francis just says ""See you guys later, time to go back to my mansion"".   I just could not get over the fiction mixed in with all the real elements.",1
44,"Also, I found the movie to be too slow paced and boring. Wow. It's so interesting reading all of these comments. I don't think very many people got the movie. Some of you see it as poverty glorification. Other seem to see it as just a woman down-on-her-luck by economic disaster, who finds peace by letting go of the past, through the storytelling lens of homelessness in American landscapes. But I didn't see any of that. ",1
45,"I saw a story of a woman finding happiness. Its a feminist anthem. I saw a woman who has always been capable, independent and comfortable in her situation, no matter the situation, as long as it was a ""choice"" she actively made for herself. Its about freedom. She's always lived her life away from the traditional, ""rational"" choices. ",1
46,"She left her happy family young and somewhat spontaneously got married, moved to a middle of nowhere town and lived out the majority of her life there, with seemingly few complaints. She wasnt starstruck in love, because that's not how most relationships work, and she's not that kind of person. She prides herself on self-sufficiency and likes to keep things simple - no drama, if you will. She made a choice to leave home and be this other person in Nevada. ",1
47,"Then Beau died, and that wasn't her choice, and was the first thing she couldn't control. ",1
48,Her solution to dealing with that was to simply stick it out and try to maintain her life as best she could. ,1
49,"But then the town and economy went under and that was also not her choice. The world around her kept taking away her freedoms, and her ability to be self-sufficient. ",1
50,"And since she's always been a survivor that likes to get by on her own independence, she felt like her only option was vanlife. Which, at first, wasnt a choice to her (at least not consciously). She thought it was thrust upon her, that she was a pure victim in its decision. ",1
51,"But as the story reveals, vanlife WAS a conscious choice she made. ",1
52,"She was a victim of some things, sure, we all are, but living in a van was NOT one of them. ",1
53,"She did have friends and family to lean on. But going to them would be choosing against self sufficiency, independence and freedom. So, she doesnt consider those options as realistic. She even had a potential love interest (a rich hot guy too, might I add!!) to make a life with, and a home on the pac nw coast to maybe grow old in. But she also turned that down. She was also relatively healthy, young and educated with a good work ethic and could easily get a job and rent an apartment somewhere else. But she never even considered those options. ",1
54,She DID choose vanlife. ,1
55,"And for some reason, accepting this reality, seems to offend everyone. ",1
56,"If you think she's a victim of economic evils, you're happy to tell the sad narrative of the aging nomads as a FU to capitalists. If you think she's an aging hippy or slack jaw yokel making bad decisions, you're happy to accept her choices as fleeting ""alternative lifestyles"" or bad choices that uneducated people ""make"". ",1
57,"But really, she's just a woman doing her own thing. And guess what? It does not need a justification. ",1
58,"The ask for it to be justified by her family, old friends, society, movie goers, etc is the very problem and the thing that takes her sense of freedom away. And the very point that the movie is making. Stop asking so hard for a REASON as it devalues her choices and makes her happiness seem questionable. ",1
59,"People are trying so hard to politicize her choices, they're forgetting that its a movie about a person, not a situation. ",1
60,"And to be clear, this expectation of who she COULD be and what she SHOULD do is what led her to think she was unhappy for portion of the film. Even she didn't realize her happiness was already available to her until she had the opportunity to make a CONCIOUS choice to vanlife, confidently. In other words, her situation never changed throughout the whole movie, but her perception did as her confidence of her choices to live this way changed. ",1
61,"Yes, letting go of her past memories is part of this, but even without that whole plot point, her real catharsis moment was walking away from the free guest house and choosing the van and solo life. ",1
62,The film is consistent in showing this narrative. ,1
63,"Its about being a woman that is happy being alone, as aloneness isnt loneliness. And peaceful aloneness isnt only acceptable for men living out their ""Into The Wild"" dreams of adventure and romanticism. As society makes it okay for men to make these choices. The movie even showed this as none of the male characters had conversations justifying their homelessness, but all the main female characters did in one way or another.",1
64,"My other favorite depiction of this truth is Sparky. Sparky told a lovely story of her happiness as adventures in nature she experienced in solitude. She didn't go on and on about how you need partners, droves of friends, children, etc, or how she missed out on these things, or how she was rushing back to those things in her final moments. No, she talked about flying with birds while kayaking in Alaska and seeing a moose alongside the road. She and Fern were both the same. ",1
65,"And that's okay. That's the moral of the story. I liked the first half and was into it until I realized it was just doing the same loop over and over again with different locations. Then it just became too samey and started to lose me. Like they got the point across I feel like pretty early then didn’t really know what else to do for the rest of the movie so they just repeated themselves to fill the runtime. It wasn’t bad but after all the awards and hype I just expected it to be better. But I seem to be in the minority so maybe I just missed something Great film, very beautiful and very human. Felt like a documentary at times. I would have preferred a more robust score or soundtrack, though maybe that would have altered the mood too much.",1
66,"One thing, is this movie rated R solely for the brief nude swimming scene? Apart from that and a few mild swears, I feel like this could be a PG movie.",1
67,That ending was incredible. So satisfying. That’s what your bitch ass gets for cheating On Rooney Mara The violence really stuck out to me in this. It's a much more subdued story than I thought it'd be which lent itself to a real feeling of impact from it. Bradley Cooper killed it. Disclaimer: I've never seen the original or read the book.,1
68,"Guillermo del Toro is my favorite director. I absolutely love his style and his stories. The first half of the film felt at home in a Del Toro flick. The darkness. The production design. The second half slowed, but still had some Del Toro touches.  I don't know why but the man loves tile walls and floors.",1
69,Overall I enjoyed it. The ensemble of fantastic actors came together for a dark story that was foreshadowed early on.,1
70,"I did leave the theater confused about Cate Blanchett character's motive behind the double cross.  I wasn't sure if she just wanted the money, or she wanted to get back at him for humiliating her during his show.",1
71,"Also. The murder / suicide in the middle of the film was SOOO loud! I might be in the minority, but I liked this a lot more than Shape of Water. I loved this movie. The ending hit me hard and my mouth was open and I was just so shocked. The brutal irony. I think this is Cooper’s best work - that scene of him laughing and crying will stay with me for a while. There's been a few longer films this year and I'm glad this one didn't feel it. I thought it was pretty consistently entertaining.   ",1
72,That being said....,1
73,This movie just felt weirdly shapeless to me. ,1
74,"I know ""What's the point?"" is an overused/pointless criticism but in this case I really didn't know what I was supposed to get out of this experience.",1
75,"The ending was incredibly telegraphed from the beginning of the film, which made it feel less weighty. ",1
76,Stanton fucks up and then pays in a pretty terrible way.. OK? ,1
77,He decides to start drinking because Dr. Ritter looks at him coy a couple of times. Later he suddenly shouts at Molly that he doesn't need her anymore. OK? ,1
78,"His characterization was also all over the place. I don't think he, or any of the characters, had much in the way of motivation. So we're just watching archetypes go through things and have things happen to them - Molly is sweet and innocent, Ezra is arrogant, etc. ",1
79,"I just wish there was more meat on the bone. I felt like in the end none of what happened really was of any consequence. But you can’t be any geek of the street… Earn your keep. I want to live in Cate Blanchett’s office. That is the most gorgeous movie set I’ve seen in years. I saw this last weekend at a screening where Del Toro was doing a Q&A after the show. The Q&A went long, and the people running the theater politely reminded the moderator, Nicole Holofcener, that they needed to get ready to screen “House of Gucci.” ",1
80,"To which Del Toro said, “Gucci can wait.” And they kept going and it was awesome. I didn't know this was a remake but I liked it for what it is. I think Willem Dafoe was the standout. I thought this was beautiful, stunning. loved the buildup. I hated Stanton for the entire movie because he didn’t help the geeks at the start, so his end was perfect. That final scene is gonna stick with me forever, of course you give that role to Tim Blake Nelson Some things that were *chef kiss* splendid about the movie in my opinion:",1
81,"* The very last line of the film is different in the book. The book version is “I was *made* for this.” vs. 2021’s “I was *born* for this.” Extremely small change that dramatically shifts the meaning of the movie. In the book the implication from made is that his transformation to a geek is the culmination of his life choices and what happened to him. del Toro’s “born” implies that this was Stan’s destiny. That regardless of what he did in his lifetime, his fate as a geek was inescapable.",1
82,"* The fact that del Toro put the Rorschach tests on the walls of Dr. Ritter’s office. He mentioned this conveys a sense of perfectionism in her office, one that masked the hidden chambers. Which was symbolic of her character. Exquisite and put together, but at the same time a carefully crafted facade to mask her true intentions. ",1
83,"* The main focus of the movie is obviously witnessing a full circle in Stan’s character development as he goes from looking down on the geek with a superiority complex, to becoming the geek himself at the lowest point in his life. This theme is represented symbolically by the Ferris wheel.",1
84,"* In the book he is not the only one who’s life can be described as circular. Molly’s father was a compulsive gambler and her husband after leaving Stan also turns out to be a gambler. She too arrives where she started as the victim of a man’s addiction. Which hits hard IMO because as the most moral main character, you would think her morality would exempt her from this fate, evidently it does not.",1
85,"* The line when Stan enters Dr. Ritter’s office for the first time, “Did you hear? We’re at war.” Stuck out to me but I wasn’t sure why. I later read that this A keeps the timeline of events in our peripheral, but more importantly B it’s not just the US that is at war, but war describes the relationship between Stan and Dr. Ritter perfectly. They both need to feel powerful and superior to the other. Their time spent in her office is a battle of the wits. You see their perspectives shift constantly from Dr. Ritter looking down on him, to Stan looking down on her to demonstrate the back and forth between them. I saw many people where confused by her character’s motives. I think at the end of it, she needed the last laugh on him. She was not motivated by money but power. Money was a tool to get power over Stan. She needed to beat him as his own game. Film Noir tale of rags to riches to rags fueled by murder, greed and vengeance. How a man that smart and good at scamming didn’t prevent Ezra Grindle would go running to “Molly” as a mad man? That scenario was very possible The set design was fantastic. Cate Blanchett's office was BEAUTIFUL, the round lounge where Stanton and Molly are performing their act was great, and the carnival in the first half was engaging and felt alive and bustling (the fun house scene where Bradley Cooper is looking for the geek was great). I loved all of the art deco in the second half.",1
86,"Pretty disappointed in the character development and pacing. I honestly think that each major character could have used an extra scene cementing their motives in the movie, and that's saying a lot for a movie that I think was at least half an hour too long. ",1
87,"I have a few issues with Bradley Cooper's character. To start, I didn't get why he joined the circus in the first place. Maybe I missed it, but they didn't explain at ALL that he was on the run, looking for a job, etc. I knew nothing about the movie going in and my hypothesis after the very first scene was that it was some mob hit. Then Bradley Cooper just gets on a bus and joins a circus on a whim? Surely he had a job or something right? I thought he was taking the bus back home or to the office or something. Really threw me off. ",1
88,"I see lot of people saying that he's a ""think he's always the smartest in the room""-type character, but he starts off the movie SO incredibly meek. His lack of dialogue through the start of the movie almost had me convinced that he was playing a mute character. Then when he gets a bath at Zeena's, they do a terrible job selling him a suave, confident character (in fact it seems quite intentional that they were selling him as the opposite). But then he spends a few days as her Barker and all of a sudden he's got grade-A schmooze ability that he carries on through the rest of the film? The rest of the film plays out in a very circular manner, so I didn't get why didn't his confidence crash back down like the rest of him? It didn't sit with me.",1
89,"Him starting to drink really threw me off as well. I thought they had done a good job setting him up as someone who would never drink, and not in the way that prepares you just enough to see him succumb. In the moment, it was just ""oh, that's weird, he said he would never drink but now he is. Cool."" I thought he was convincing enough when he told Cate Blanchett that he never drinks (Cate Blanchett pressing him saying ""Never. There's that word again."" left me wanting A LOT more in that discussion, but it was never really brought up again iirc), but small things like him fetching Pete a bottle of alcohol without taking even a small moment to consider a drink himself sold me that he wouldn't break. There was no foreshadowing at ALL, and him taking a sip from Blanchett's alcohol was not a satisfyingly dramatic, shocking twist because they hadn't set up the plot point that his father was an alcoholic. It becomes clear later in the movie how devastating this is (that scene is pretty much the turning point for his character arc), but you don't get that in the moment. His inevitable downfall after taking that drink felt predictable, but I didn't really know why because (again) that hadn't built up any weight to that action (aside maybe from foreshadowing with how it was Peet's downfall, too).",1
90,"~~Super minor point, but the him having his father’s watch felt really underdeveloped too. I’m pretty sure they don’t explain that it’s his father’s watch at all until later in the movie, then have him say that he hates his father which imo throws out any emotional attachment that may have been built up to him owning it. Him pawning it off at the end still felt pretty sad, but I think the scene could have easily hit harder.~~ Edit: nvm, its mentioned when he goes to Zeena’s and talks to Pete",1
91,Not all scenes were terrible though. I thought the scene where the sheriff and police storm the carnival was a real bright spot in the movie. It was so satisfying watching Bradley Cooper talk his way out of that.,1
92,"Thankfully the rest of the acting was pretty great. I really liked Bradley Cooper's performance regardless of how his character was written (his fluctuating accents kinda bothered me, but perhaps it's intentional and a throw back to when Zeena tells him to lay on different accents for different crowds) as well as Willem Dafoe's, Cate (lol it's spelled Cater in the post) Blanchett, Ron Perlman, and David Straithairn. Just a shame to see such great acting carrying an otherwise tough script. Molly didn't really do it for me - I think Rooney Mara's acting was a little stiff but I think she's really the only knock I can give the movie acting wise.",1
93,"The closing shutter transitions felt a little unnecessary. I get that it was trying to invoke an older era of film making, but it really stood out in contrast to the rest of the film's clean, digital look. It didn't feel coherent at all. Like you can't just throw in old-style transitions like that and say the job's done. If they were trying to harken the entire movie back to 40's, they did a pretty terrible job imo (although I may be missing some things, I'm not a film studies person at all or anything). I really hope the black and white cut fixes some of this.",1
94,"As I mentioned above, the movie was also pretty predictable. I guess that's not necessarily a bad thing, but I think I prefer to be surprised. I knew as soon as Bradley Cooper hid behind the cages of chickens that he would become a geek by the end of the movie. I also guessed the ending line pretty early on too, but I guess it was a satisfying end.",1
95,"Also, not sure if anyone else picked up on this but some of the camera shots were really offputting. There was something really unnatural in the way that a few character's heads were bobbing in several close ups. At one point I honestly started to wonder if they were using heavy facial animations, and not in a good way. I liked this but I was still a little disappointed. This movie is 40 minutes longer than the 1947 version and you really feel that extra run time. On top of that, the original felt like a much more focused film that was really trying to play as a critique on religion and this movie mostly dropped that theme, but there are still some vestigial remnants in the story that just feel underdeveloped. I also don't think the remake handles the tonal shift near the end as well as the original did. ",1
96,"On the positive side, I thought the set design was really good. The carnival felt dirty, the fun house was creepy, and Cate Blanchett's office felt big and expensive. Willem Dafoe was tremendous in his relatively small role. He really felt like a sleezey old-timey carnival barker. I also thought the ending really improved on the original. In the 1947 version it felt like it sort of cops out for the happy Hollywood ending. This one is dark and depressing and Bradley Cooper's performance in that scene was haunting. He resented his father for two things: Alcoholism, and letting his mother cheat and escape with another man. ",1
97,"Coincidentally, the first and last things he does in the film are:",1
98,Sleep with a married woman.,1
99,"Accept the geek job after not even getting the chance to perform his mentalism act due to smelling of alcohol. Seeing a lot of comments saying that the ending is hugely telegraphed, presumably by the scene between Cooper and Dafoe after the first Geek is dropped off, but for my part I think it enhances the ending. It would be one thing if Stanton is blindsided by the geek job at the end, and if we actually saw him in the role I think that would be a detriment. But as that offer is given, he knows exactly what job it’s gonna be and that wouldn’t be the case if it weren’t signposted ahead of time The best things about this movie in my opinion are both Cooper’s acting and the writing for Stanton.",1
100,"Throughout the film you constantly want to like Carlisle until you remember how absolutely terrible of a person he is. The con man character manages to con you throughout the entire movie. What makes the role even more fulfilling are the not so subtle, stereotypical gaslight lines Carlisle will pull throughout, and they are delivered so well that it takes just a second for the true intention to click. A great example of this is when he is chasing Molly into the men’s bathroom trying to convince her to help him and he says “please dont leave me like everyone else” or something along those lines. Gaslighting 101, but the scene is crafted so well and Bradley Cooper does such a great job that for a second you think this is a romantic moment, only to realize it’s typical manipulation that Carlisle has been pulling on customers the entire time, now just expanded towards those he “loves”. Seeing Nightmare Alley and Spider-Man No Way Home on back to back evenings was a trip because of Willem DaFoe. Two completely different performances but the masterclass of DaFoe’s acting was amazing. No pun intended. This 1000% gave me Uncut Gems vibes while watching this. Stress, tension, bad decisions.",1
101," Only difference was I wanted Howard to succeed while I FUCKING hated Stan. I felt like the Cate Blanchett might have been a step too much, the reveal didn't really hit with me.",1
102,"Him turning into a geek at the end was such an awesome ending tho. I swear this man would make a pretty good Bioshock movie. I feel all us Nightmare Alley fans now look like ""the final shot"" now staring at the box office difference between Nightmare Alley and Spider-Man.",1
103,There were parts where I thought it was a Lady Gaga origin story “Music is essentially any note between twelve octaves. Twelve notes and the octave repeats. It’s the same story told over and over. All that the artist can offer the world is how they see those twelve notes.”,1
104,"Really loved this quote, and it made me wonder if they were playing along to the fact that this is just a retelling of an older story from a different point of view. I thought it was a nice touch at the end where they flash to Jackson singing ""I'll never love again"" but in his normal voice as opposed to his ""brother's voice"". It felt that it showed that Jackson had found himself through Ally. Was it just me or was the cinematography really great? I’ve never noticed it to the point of stopping my viewing of a movie to compliment it. I haven't seen any previous versions of A Star Is Born, so I'm not sure where credit is due for this, but it's beautifully poetic that he starts their relationship by completing one of her song ideas, and she honors him at the end by completing one of his. The look in Jack's eyes as he realizes he would end up being the reason Ally would not be heard was heart breaking.",1

108,"Fuck that agent guy. When I saw that steak, I was like awww man this is it.  Any recovering alcoholics in the thread?  I knew it was gonna be tough, but holy shit....seeing him be so mean to her in the bathtub, and the Grammys, that hit me harder than the ending (which was also excellent)",1
109,"Also when his brother told him “I told you but you were drunk”, that hit hard too",1
110,"I’m six months in, I don’t know if I could have done it earlier in my sobriety....great job by all I think Ally becomes a Star in the final scene of the film. Although she achieved mainstream fame she wasn’t being true to herself and Jack could see it. When he tells her having something to say and a way to say it so that people listen is what really matters...and she delivers the final performance of the film...after such a shocking and tragic turn of events...the most incredible performance of all time!  A scene I don't see talked about: Ally meets Jack in rehab and he breaks down crying and apologizing for embarrassing her. Such a great scene.  It's honestly baffling to me how this movie was so good.  I mean, it is a pretty standard story that hits all the normal beats, but everything is so well done that it really elevates it.  My only complaint (and this says a lot), is that I thought it should have been a half hour longer.  I wanted more Chappelle, more Diceman, more everything really.  I ALWAYS complain that movies are 20-30 minutes too long and this is the first time in a long time I thought a film would have benefited greatly from a little more breathing room. There was some obvious foreshadowing throughout the movie, but something I noticed was how Jackson offered up his vinyl collection to Ally's dad. It's never a good sign when someone starts giving away the things they have spent years collecting without thinking twice.  Jack struggling to tell his brother that he was the one he always looked up to, not their father, absolutely gutted me. And Ally’s first experience on stage with Jack was another moment that sent shivers down my spine. Amazing film, looking forward to seeing it again.  That cut at the very end where we transition from Ally on stage to her and Jackson at the piano. Good lord that released the tear buckets for me. Hands down one of the best moments of editing I’ve seen all year Holy shit, their chemistry. Insane. I could go on and on about the different aspects that I loved. Especially the little things. Like the title drop at the beginning felt like a throwback to 70s or 80s films and got me smiling right away. Great film. Sam Elliott backing the truck up trying to hold back tears gave me all of the emotions. Absolutely loved this movie. Shattered my heart. Hated the manager from the moment he came on screen. Dick. I went to her Joanne tour and was amazed that they actually shot a scene there. You can really tell that without Gaga the scope of the movie would’ve been probably much smaller with very different music. I also loved the SNL bit with Alec Baldwin. I had no idea they shot that.  Getting high and seeing this movie after getting broken up with my girlfriend of eight years was ill-advised. I thought Gaga couldn't do it, but walked out remembering the 80's when all of a sudden we all realized that Cher was a great fucking actress and started racking up Oscar nominations left and right, for multiple roles.  Gaga killed it.  She's on her way. >I'm off the deep end  ",1

115,"RIP this song is super morbid now An aspect to the dialog I really liked was that they would frequently talk over each other. It made it feel a lot more real to me. Also when they're in the bar, they struggle to hear each other and it just plays like a very natural conversation. A small aspect of the movie that just really made it for me. I love the fact Bradley Cooper gave Lady Gaga first billing. It really showed how much he respects her.  The first time Jack brings Ally on stage and her performance had me fucking crying in the theater  Bradley Cooper sure has come a long way since The Hangover. Dude has some serious talent.  I probably should have looked up the plot of the originals beforehand. That ending brought back so many feelings from the past (that I’m thankfully past now) - feelings of dragging your friends and family down, and that it’s all due to the weight of your own failures.

116,"Fantastic movie, top tier performances, one of my favorites of the year, never want to see it ever again.",1
117,"When the person they thought was a corpse starting screaming at the beginning of the first battle scared the absolute shit out of me Andrew Garfield's boyish smile when looking at his wife is the greatest thing I'll see all week ""He even carried down some Japs... they didn't make it though.."" Of all the horror movies I've seen this year the green flare nightmare in this scared me the most I don't get emotional at movies. I sit through most of them stone faced, hell I didn't even shed a tear at the end of Marley & Me. Hacksaw Ridge made me cry. ",1
118,"Mel Gibson did a very good job at showing the harshness of Doss's world, from the beatings of his father to the hellscape on top of the ridge. It would be so easy for Doss to succumb to this violent, thuggish place. But he doesn't. He just saves people and something about the strength of his resolve and the purity of his intentions really struck a cord with me. When Capt. Glover describes Doss as the ""bravest man he ever met"" during the credits I just lost it. It's been a very long time since a movies done that to me. Actually I think the last time was when I saw Braveheart for the first time.",1
119,"Glad to have you back, Mel.  I knew the violence was coming. I knew this movie was going to be brutal, but when the battle finally started I still wasn't ready. How did this movie only have a budget of $40 million with all the names in the cast, much less the battle scenes ? I really liked Hacksaw Ridge. It was edited so well and each actor did an amazing job. ",1
120,The dinner scene when Desmond's parents find out his brother has enlisted was so well done. Hugo Weaving as Thomas Doss was perfect. ,1
121,I think one of the most moving parts was when he came down and was walking through everyone in silence.,1
122,Loved it loved it loved it. The final battle sequence was so well done. Not the visceral moment-to-moment intensity of the previous battles but rather a montage of violence shot with extreme beauty. Like that shot where the camera seemed attached to the back of the rifle as it fired.,1
123,"Also very glad to see a Christian movie done right. Not a cheesy story where religion is the primary focus but rather a film with a dramatic arc and a legitimate character piece displaying how his belief helped him achieve something beyond himself. As a Christian myself it felt great to see that depicted so well here.  Has Hugo Weaving ever not nailed a role? Sam Worthington's accent varied between ""so Australian he probably has VB tinnies in his grenade pouch"" to ""sort of American"" Hugo had me on the verge of tears when he saw his son in the uniform at dinner. Also, the first battle scene... so intense. Hard to watch. Loved that this movie did not glorify war in any sense Out of all the gore in this movie the biggest gasp that came from my audience was when Desmond hit his brother with the brick [deleted] Absolutely moving performance from Andrew Garfield.

124, Did it bother anyone else they didn't mention/show brother after dinner scene. ,1
125,"Felt like they really rushed the ending. Like they had 20-40 extra minutes and just said ""eh fuck it, let's end it here"" The very beginning of the first firefight is permanently etched in my memory forever. I couldn't believe what I was watching for those first ten seconds.",1
126,"Mel is one hell of a filmmaker. Seeing Vince Vaughn in a more serious movie scared me at first but every time he was on screen he killed it. Such a good fit  Man I read one of the negative reviews linked on RT and the reviewer is whining about the violence in the film and how it's not necessary for a war movie. Apparently a war movie about an unarmed medic shouldn't show just how gruesome it is. It's rare that a movie can come across as inspiring and uplifting despite being one of the most violent films in recent years. Mel Gibson balanced the two wonderfully.  I think the dude at the very opening of the movie who is yelling over him being carried was Mel Gibson himself. Can't be sure though! Wow. The part where Desmond is telling the story of the moment he took the vow to never pick up a gun again (with violent intent?) really resonated with me. I know what it's like to some extent to hold certain beliefs that are irrational to most others that are based upon rough patches early years of life. I think others might have found it corny during the explanation when he says ""but I killed him in my heart"" but that line was very powerful to me. Great movie with a lot of interesting things to think about. The movie was fucking amazing. It was so brutal and yet very uplifting. I got pretty emotional when he roped himself down and started walking while everyone was staring at him. Was Andrew Garfield ""talking to god"" or the Academy during that scene when Smitty died? That's an Oscar if I've ever seen one  It's funny...this comment thread is actually a good representation of how Reddit treats any popular/recent film. The comments from 1-3 days ago almost all hate on the film, while the comments from 21 - 30 days ago are showering it with praises.",1

135," I liked the movie even tho it has a lot of flaws. One of the things that is bothering me the most is Saw Garrera's tentacle monster (sorry I don't remember it's name). It had close to no purpose and Bodhi only seems a bit confused for 10 seconds before getting back to normal. It blows me away that they didn't just delete those scenes after deciding not to go with a storyline where Bodhi loses his mind...  I don't know why, but one of my favorite aspects of the movie was that as everyone else in the Alliance is squabbling and politicking, Admiral Raddus just says ""Fuck this shit"" and takes his entire fleet and attacks the Empire. They're still trying to decide whether to take the Death Star plans to the *Senate* to get a court set up against the Emperor and Raddus is already in a shooting war with the Empire and he seems like he couldn't be happier.  I liked the nice little touch that Vader's helmet had the red lenses for his eyes like he does in Episode IV. Good bit of continuity  The Vader scene at the end was amazing. It literally bumped the movies score for me. We finally got to see Vader in his prime tear shit up!  Let's all be thankful we weren't forced to watch a makeout scene right at the end. ",0
136,"Also Vader is a sassy motherfucker and I love him for it.  Are R2D2 and C3PO going to be the Stan Lee of the Star Wars universe? Darth Vader wasting those Rebel soldiers in the last 10 minutes is one of the best scene in all of Star Wars movies and it really shows how ruthless and terrifying Vader is I throughly enjoyed seeing some AT-ATs get blown apart by Rebel air power. One of them got split in half by an x-wing. And seeing Y-wings pull off bombing runs? Rogue squadron 2 all over again.  Did anybody else wet themselves a little when half the rebel fleet came into view from hyperspace during the final battle?? It reminded me so much of the epic moments you had playing through the rogue squadron video games.  My biggest beef with the movie is by the end of it I didn't retain anyone's names. Looking at this cast list, I am surprised by the names of some of the characters. No weird powerpoint presentation transitions 0/10 star wars movie.  Is it me or did the pilot flinch when he heard Saw Gerrera use his breather? Seems like it reminded him of Vader maybe. I thought it was a nice detail That Darth Vader scene at the end left me with no words. I really liked the movie, but that last scene just totally blew me away. It was brutal, and you could totally feel the fear of the rebels as Vader slayed them effortlessly. Never seen anything like that on Star Wars before and I loved it. It really shows you just how lethal Lord Vader was, something only spoken of in novels and never seen in film. This movie probably had the best starship porn I've ever seen.",0

Beatlemania but for Hitler with “I Want to Hold Your Hand” in German playing. Absolutely brilliant. Saw it tonight and loved it. Just wanted to share my theater experience as I thought I witnessed something really sweet:",1
146,"So I was in a really small theater and directly in front of me was a mom and her probably 13 year old son. As the previews began they started going back and forth arguing because the son wanted to get popcorn and the mom was telling him no. This went on for what seemed like 5 straight minutes as he kept persisting and it got to the point where she just goes, “I will drag you out of this theater right now if you don’t stop and watch the movie.” Needless to say he was pissed but finally gave up when the movie started and I just laughed to myself.",1
147,"Fast forward to the end of the movie, and we obviously just sat through this very deep and emotional story centering around a close mother-son relationship. As soon as the closing credits started rolling, I look down and see the boy leaned over tightly hugging his mom. ",1
148,"It was a small thing to witness, but I just found it really touching to see how the story clearly moved this boy. i didnt see much comment on this, but i loved the scene where the older hitler youth kids are being sent off to die on the front and still acting like stupid teens, mocking some dumb kid. it really drives home how young and immature they are and makes even those guys sympathetic. I think the movie did a great job capturing how silly Nazi ideology is, while also showing the damage and human suffering it causes. The shot where Jojo sees his mother's shoes is probably now one of my favourite shots in film ever.",1
149,I expected the laughter. I didn't expect so much crying. What a fantastic film. Something I haven't seen many people talking about yet is how immediately after the butterfly scene as Jojo is mourning Waititi lets the camera sit on the roof dormers (like the one Elsa can look out of in her hiding spot) looking over the hanging. The thought of other Jews hiding in all those homes mourning with Jojo brought the scene up to 11 for me. I needed way more Yorki. That kid had me dying every line he had.,1
150,"In all honesty though, one of my favorite movies of the year. Sam Rockwell yelling at Jojo calling him a Jew and thus saving him really was amazing.

Sam Rockwell's last scene had me sobbing into my popcorn Considering the current climate, this movie could've really been mishandled but Taika nailed the perfect balance between comedy and seriousness by always having the brutality of the Nazi regime bubbling underneath the surface ready to pop out at any moment. Two scenes in particular really highlight this (the Rabbit scene and that OTHER one, I'm sure I don't have to describe). That German Shepard bit was worth it alone having trouble digesting the content of the critics’ negative reviews - i thought this was a blithely beautiful melding of comedy and the atrocities of war. scarjo and rockwell were excellent, but my god, the kids. a lot of good child performances are created in the editing room... but not here. raw and honest and hysterical. sweetness without sappiness.",1

155,"I love how gradual Jojo's respect and love for Elsa grows throughout the movie (despite the extreme adversity between the two), the chemistry between them was fantastic. By the time they were dancing at the end, I had a huge smile on my face; it felt like the true beginning of a beautiful friendship While a lot of people have pointed out the focus that was put on Rosie's shoes and how it sets up the future gut punch I feel like I haven't seen anyone discuss the relationship between Jojo learning to tie his shoes, how it parallels his evolving worldview, and how it relates to one of the over-arching themes of the movie.",1
156,"At the beginning of the movie, Jojo doesn't know how to tie his shoes and needs his mother to do it for him. At this same point in time his worldview is immature (you could even argue that it's non-existent); he's entirely bought into Nazi propaganda and parrots all their beliefs. He needs someone to tell him what/how to think as he doesn't have the experience to form his own ideas. ",1
157,"As the movie goes on he takes these beliefs and ideas out into the world where they begin to be challenged. He sees the bodies of Germans being hung, bonds with Elsa, and discusses the war with his mother. Ultimately, he discovers her body as a result of her involvement in the resistance. He tries to tie her shoes for her as he mourns but ends up failing halfway through. ",1
158,"To me this represented the true test of his beliefs. There's an internal conflict between his support of Nazi-ism and the love of his mother & Elsa. He's struggling to reconcile his support of the war with the horrors he's seen.  How can his mother, his caretaker, the best person he knows, be will to sacrifice everything to fight against everything he believes in? While he doesn't completely denounce Nazi-ism at this point you can tell that, at the very least, he's halfway there. While he couldn't tie his mother's shoes, he was able to get halfway done.",1
159,"His disillusionment continues to grow through out the battle preparations, his discussion regarding Jews with Yorki, and the conclusion of the war itself, culminating with him yeeting imaginary Hitler out of a window.  It's only after this that we finally see him successfully tie Elsa's shoes.",1
160,"Tying your shoes requires a base level of coordination, dexterity, and fine motor skills and is considered a developmental milestone. It's one of the first things you learn that requires actual effort and practice; it requires trial & error. It marks the transition between infancy and childhood.",1
161,"In the same vein, a nuanced and mature out look on life isn't something that you're born with or can be given. It's something that is constantly evolving, refined by life experience; it's something that you have to be open to and to continue to work on/towards. Realizing this is a milestone and marks the transition between childhood and adolescence. ",1
162,"To me Waititi is saying that Nazi-ism and other worldviews based on massive generalizations and hatred of those who are different than oneself are immature and childish. Recognizing this is so fundamental; so incredibly basic; that it can be compared to learning tie your shoes. Much like how tying your shoes is a key marker in growing up, hate-based ideology is similarly juvenile and must be left behind. Scarlett Johansson dying in this film gave me a far greater gut punch than her death in Endgame ever did.",1
163,"She was really charismatic in this film, the characters were all written great!! I’m thinking the recurring motif of shoes is also a reference to the thousands of shoes on display at various Holocaust museums that were taken away from those arriving to the concentration camps. It’s always a startling image.",1
164,"I got a kick out of the Watergate ending because it felt like I was watching a post-credit scene teasing the next film in the American History Cinematic Universe I Fucking loved that Bob and David had their first scene in the movie together.  Anyone else love how they showed the typesetting machines near the end? I love that kind of stuff in movies. I love how they tried to make the movie feel super feminist, but when that lady started reading out the results of the trial, that dude just jumped in and shouted out the answer. Literally lol'd. It’s the most dramatic re-enactment if people carrying folders with papers in them.  Over and over again.  But it was great [deleted] Do you think the final scenes of the movie were to set up a Nixon Cinematic Universe? The sequel could be a remake of All the Presidents Men, and then maybe onto other major historical events of the 1970s. I love that OP snuck Meth Damon into the credits haha Great tweet from Tyler Simpson (@braintasm) -",1
165,"“Went and saw The Post tonight. I watched a film about newspapers inside a movie theater inside of a mall. It was a dying industry turducken.” Don’t have time to post a thorough detailed analysis, but I absolutely loved the ending! The way they transitioned it to watergate was amazing. I enjoyed it. It has the hallmarks of Spielberg's late works. Especially the preening Americana of reading the Majority opinion of the SCOTUS to the newsroom aloud and Meryl Streep walking down the SCOTUS steps as a row of women look on. It's the kind of hokey bullshit Spielberg does when he's on auto pilot. It's an exclamation point where a period would have been better. ",1
166,"The bulk of the movie, following all these people doing the reporting is quite exciting although I wish more time was dedicated to spending time with Daniel Ellsberg and some of the attempts to actually get the Pentagon papers out into the public record like Sen. Mike Gravel actually reading them on the senate floor. It's a tight movie but not expansive in the ways it could have been. ",1
167,It's still a good movie. I would recommend it. The performances all around are pretty stellar.  ,1
168,"I will say John Williams action material played over the end credits was quite good. Reminded me of his days working with Oliver Stone on Nixon Overall the film is pretty mid level Spielberg but goddamn can Spielberg block and shoot a scene. So many elegant walk and talks and great visual storytelling. I saw both the Commuter and The Post today. I was surprised to see more people at the screening for the Post than for the Commuter. It was mostly a bunch of old people that went to see the Post and surprisingly they were a fun crowd.  I actually didn't really know anything about this going into it. I knew it was Spielberg, Hanks and Streep. I knew it was about a newspaper fighting to publish. I thought it was going to be more court room drama, we got like 3 minutes in the courts, if that. ",1
169,"But the cast was stacked. Phenomenally written and acted and I just all around loved it. Might watch it again to share with my family, but for the most part this was a one and done affair for me.",1
170,And I have to say I love Spielberg's love of history. I love how he'll do a big budget action flick and then one of these cool period true life period dramas.  The sequence of Streep making her decision was incredible. My audience actually clapped at the end of it.,1
171,"My complaint is that in the first half the drama really seemed to halt whenever it went to Streep. 2nd half was engaging throughout, but it did drag a bit in the first half.",1
172,"And not enough Carrie Coon or Michael Stuhlbarg, but obviously excellent performances across the board. I enjoyed the movie, but was surprised to be the only person under 50 in my theater.",1
173,"The biggest surprise for me was **David Cross**. I'm a huge *Arrested Development* fan and was shocked at how good he was in a dramatic role.  If you liked Steve Jobs in the sense that it felt like all the action took form in the place of words, you should love this. I had a great time personally. (Edited Jobs to Steve Jobs. I mixed the two up) This film is ""important"" in the most shallow sense of the word. ",1
174,It only scratches the surface of the journalistic process. *All the President's Men* and *Spotlight* completely blow this film out of the water in that respect.,1
175,There were so many cringey moments that had me rolling my eyes. ,1
176,It's just okay. 6/10 [deleted] As a companion to *Lincoln* and *Bridge of Spies* this is disappointing. It’s a pretty shallow look at the meaning of the fourth estate as opposed to the nuanced depiction of political action in *Lincoln* or his analysis of a country’s morals in *Bridge of Spies.*,1
177,"As a journalism movie, however, it kind of rocks. Given the way it was advertised I expected a somewhat sluggish period film. Instead I was decently entertained from the beginning and found myself surprised at how brisk it felt by the end. ",1
178,"I feel like this is getting misidentified as a prestige film because it’s way more of a blockbuster in its verve (hell, Williams score sounds like a damn action film at times). It’s a film about the flow of information, and Spielberg kind of captures that invisible kineticism with his camera and blocking. There’s a lot of overhead shots of papers flying in and out of frame and people moving from location to location. This movie may **feel** relatively rote but the Beard does still have great technical skill and feeling. ",1
179,"Also I know people hate it but the ending to this is so goofy I kind of love it.  The scene of Kay walking down the steps after the Supreme Court hearing into a crowd of hippie women had me rolling my eyes.  It’s almost as if Spielberg rolled out of bed and directed a movie with all his buddies (literally everyone and their mother is in this movie). This is about the most generic Spielberg drama you could possibly get. It’s fine, harmless, somewhat interesting, but ultimately forgettable. Meh.",1
180,This movie was meh.,1
181,"Competent but on autopilot. Hanks and Streep were OK but not at their greatest, a lot of the supporting cast were wasted and the script was alarmingly unsubtle and shouldn't have been nominated for a Globe. The themes were pretty much spelled out on the most annoyingly on the nose way possible (like Sarah Paulson's shoehorned speech and that eye rolling court walk scene).",1
182,Oh and that ending was just ridiculously goofy and dragged out what could have been a nice ending.,1
183,"It's not all bad - the score's great and some scenes of the journalism and printing were genuinely quite enthralling. But this is really just bogstandard Spielberg historical drama and is one of his weakest efforts. Certainly of the big awards contenders that I've seen so far this is comfortably the weakest one. I loved this movie, I live in Venezuela and used to work in a local tv station banned by the regime, it touched a nerve in me. I'm disappointed by some of the comments here, I guess you don't know what you have until you lose it. ",1
184,The right for free press must not be taken for granted. I really hated the part where Sarah Paulson spelled out Meryl Streep’s character arc to Tom Hanks.,1
185,"I enjoyed it, but I would have appreciated more discussion about the music and its creation in the studio.  It seemed to focus heavily on the culture that surrounded them, which is fine and intersting, but not enough on the actual music. It felt more like a John Cale and Lou Reed biographical documentary, rather than a music documentary.  It took too long to get to the creation of the VU, and not enough time on the demise of the VU, which felt like a small paragraph in this novel of a documentary.  ",0
186,"Still, I'm glad it was made. The Jonathan Richman interviews were fantastic.  I could watch a whole documentary of just him talking about the Velvet Underground. I recommend Owen Gleiberman's review, which I agree with 100%: [https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/the-velvet-underground-review-todd-haynes-john-cale-lou-reed-1235013500/](https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/the-velvet-underground-review-todd-haynes-john-cale-lou-reed-1235013500/)",0
187,"As a casual (far from hardcore) fan, I was quite disappointed in the coverage. Would have liked to see much more on the post-Cale albums (especially the 1969 self-titled) and on the reunion. Doug Yule is once again completely memory holed. So unfair given that he was nothing but a professional and had a major part to play in two excellent albums that have a place in music history. No mention at all of the Velvets' significance in Eastern Europe: [https://www.kcrw.com/music/articles/how-the-velvet-underground-influenced-the-velvet-revolution](https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/the-velvet-underground-review-todd-haynes-john-cale-lou-reed-1235013500/) and how that played into how they were received in the 90s right after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Very little screen time for Moe Tucker. No Laurie Anderson (she must have refused to participate but her absence is glaring). Reed's sexuality is treated awkwardly, almost with embarrassment. Not even a nod to Candy's trans identity in ""Candy Says."" I could go on.",0
188,"There were some really moving and interesting parts, especially about Cale and Reed's childhoods, reactions from audiences while on tour, East and West Coast rock rivalry, Nico's aspirations, and so on. The visual style is effective, suits a prestige doc - but it's too niche and experimental as an intro to the band and too cursory for fans. It should have been a two-parter for streaming like last year's Laurel Canyon rather than trying to cram everything into a 2-hour theatrical feature. I'm about to watch it. Just so you know, the podcast No Dogs In Space just started a series on TVU. Episode one was great, and the podcast is always a great balance of fun, and in-depth research. Saw it in the Big Screen at London Film Festival. The music sounded incredible on a massive sound system. Didn't really care for it.",0
189,"The first hour or so was boring, I wanted to watch a documentary on The Velvet Underground, not whatever that was.",0
190,"When they finally get into the music part, everything gets glossed over.",0
191,"A quick look at their Wikipedia and it says that the drummer soent the 80's working at Walmart which seems insane. It's technically well made... but it's reverent to a fault. I kept getting reminded of how Bohemian Rhapsody felt because it alluded to many things but was more interested in being stylish than it was substantial. I would've preferred a slightly more objective approach. I love The Velvet Underground & Nico, one of the best albums ever Will watch it next week in theater. Will come back here If only it was on anything but Apple TV :( I agree, it was a 2 hour documentary, but it seemed to dwell a lot on the tangential stuff, and not so much on the music. It was still good, but not so much a documentary about the band, more a film surrounding the scene that birthed them. The interviews were cool though. I have to say I wholeheartedly disagree. If you want to know that side of the story there’s a thousand Uncut and Mojo articles about ‘the creation of The Velvet Underground and Nico’. Haynes does an exceptional job of visually telling the story of New York in the 60’s/the whole Warhol art scene without the film ever feeling didactic or like you’re just watching someone (who is usually tangential to the scene) tell you what happened. Jonathan is the only person who can play the role of the ‘talking head’ and is fucking awesome. Great music film, I’d actually say the best right next to Don’t Look Back. I strongly agree with this,wish there was more in the doc about Angus MacLise and his time in the band Not a bad review, but the guy says HATES their second album. What the absolute fuck? I can't really take him seriously after that. Todd Haynes made a commitment that he would include only people who were contemporaries to the Velvets. Doug Yule was invited to participate but refused. Laurie Anderson who met Lou several decades later, has nothing to do with the VU. I would say I am a fan of TVU, but not a diehard, and really enjoyed No Dogs Left In Space covering the Velvet Underground for I think 5 podcast episodes.  I went into this doc expecting a compressed version of that story, with talking heads, actual music, and whatever footage may still exist from that time period. ",0
192,"What I got was a seemingly meandering first third/half, then onto a bit of the first few albums, a quick gloss over the collapse of the band, Andy's dead, here's the credits.  ",0
193,"I wanted something with more substance.  Dive into Lou Reed's post VU career for 2 minutes, touch on how Mo turned political decades later, talk about how Songs for Drella could have been a true reunion album, there's so much out there, but what we got was mostly smoke. Thanks, I'll have to give that a listen! Oh I missed that - guess I don’t agree 100%! Yeah, with a week's worth of hindsight I can understand his choices better and appreciate the film for what it is. But in the moment I was left unsatisfied and I still probably won't revisit or recommend it.",0
194,"“Even though I am 64 and have a dead gay husband, I manage to get up every day, live my life and feel pretty good about myself!”",1
195,"god bless julie hagerty Something that I found somewhat heartbreaking towards the end was the fact that Grandma wasn't calling him ""Charlie Bird"" anymore and didn't hug him the same way, she was just playing with the other guy. So do you watch married couples often?",1
196,"No, why would I-",1
197,"I was kidding. Driver is (rightfully so) getting a lot of praise for that argument scene, but I think that the part where he breaks down during the sidebar with Alda is equally heartbreaking. I can’t believe he didn’t think to put a picture frame over the hole in the wall. I’m not sure why, but for me the most devastating moment was Charlie walking in on the mom being goofy with the new boyfriend. It feels like the whole movie is leading up to Charlie reading what Nicole has written for him. Such an emotional gut-punch. Maybe if they had opened up to each other in the beginning and communicated what they really felt in a clear and concise manner, the divorce could've been prevented. ",1
198,"Also, another thing that I love about the movie, so much set-ups and payoffs. The knife, Henry's struggle to read (And the excellent emotional payoff of him reading the letter with his dad at the end), Nicole having to cut her family's hair and how shaggy Charlie looked during the separation. Wonderful writing. One of the best movies of 2019. Never would have thought I'd hear the voice of rex from toy story say ""four time oscar winner sucking my dick!"" But here we are. Adam Driver buying like 20 houseplants for his flat is like the most accurate break up behaviour I've ever seen Movie should be called:",1
199,"Three Lawyers Divvy Up a MacArthur Grant When Charlie tells Nicole in the end that he’s taking a residency at UCLA, there’s such a nuanced and incredibly powerful moment where Nicole just wonders, “Then why did we go through all this”? I fucking love this film. As a lawyer, this might be the most accurate legal movie I have ever seen. It nails how insane the process is to clients who have not navigated it before and how the lawyers are so divorced from the humanity of their clients and who they are opposing.",1
200,"EDIT: Even little stuff, like the tactic (which they did on Big Little Lies too this season) of meeting with lawyers to conflict them out of representing the other side.",1
201,"It's little but that scene of the lawyers chummily ordering lunch while Charlie and Nicole stare on with dead eyes was amazing. This movie cemented Adam Driver as next level actor. Holy shit, the argument scene was intense, the end where he reads the note and starts quivering - wild. This must have been a rough watch for Jennifer Jason Leigh. It has to be so weird to have your ex make a movie about your divorce. Anyone else need to take a deep breath after the argument scene in Charlie’s apartment? Some of the greatest acting I’ve ever seen One thing I noticed was that their Halloween costumes represented how they felt at that point in their lives. He was the invisible man, unseen and sort of lost. She was David Bowie, a rock star, living her best life.",1
202,"Same thing in the end, he was a ghost and she was one of The Beatles. Glad to see Ray Liotta rocking again. The fight in the apartment felt like when you see your parents screaming at each other and you desperately want them to stop fighting. It was one of the most heartbreaking scenes I've seen in any movie, which got even more devastating when Charlie collapsed on his knees and Nicole held him. Easily the career-best performances from Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson.",1
203,"Also, I had no idea Adam Driver could sing so when he belted out ""Being Alive"" I was stunned. You could feel how cathartic the song was to Charlie Between this and Jojo Rabbit, it’s a really big year for Scarlett Johansson tying shoelaces. The moment when they're closing the gate, tiny but powerful. ""Nora's great I feel like we could be friends with her.""",1
204,"""Why do I feel like that won't happen?!"" It’s a close battle between Adam Driver and Joaquin Phoenix this year. I don’t mean for the Oscar, but for who had the better scene helping a frightened person open an apartment door with bloodied hands. Loved the ongoing commentary on LA and space I caught this in theaters a couple weeks ago, and it’s my favorite film of the year. Funny, devastating, sweet...",1
205,"One thing that really worked for me was Randy Newman’s score; it has a very similar feel to his Pixar music (though totally works for this film on its own). As a 26 year old, Newman’s *Toy Story*/*Bug’s Life*/*Monster’s Inc.* scores were the soundtrack of my childhood before getting into the works of people like John Williams or Hans Zimmer.",1
206,"Hearing the playful, deeply heartfelt sounds of Newman’s music throughout this film lent it an extra emotional layer that helps it play as both very sweet and incredibly heartbreaking (like the best of Pixar). It’s a weird thing to have such a grown up film feel like an extension of my childhood.",1
207,"On a similar note: the opening sequence of Charlie and Nicole listing what they love about one another was one of the most emotionally engaging film openings I’ve experienced since *Up*. What I loved most about this film is that you could understand why she needed to divorce him also understand why the divorce was unfairly hard in him. I think Baumbach was very successful in his desire to show that ""to take sides is folly""",1

Zordon as the red Ranger was dope as fuck Man the opening scene with Zordon in the red suit crawling through the rubble was fucking amazing. I wish there was more of that. I lost my shit when they recreated the zords running to the original opening theme. For about 5 seconds I was a little kid again. People keep asking how they are going to make six movies. It's pretty clear that it'll be funded by krispy kreme. when the Megazord forms and like QWOP, instantly falls over. That elevated the movie.  That was cheesy as fuck. And I thoroughly enjoyed it. I mean, they had Rita say ""make my monster grow"" and bitch-slapped her to the moon.",0
213,Huge props to the main actors too. They had great chemistry and really sold the characters. And Banks was appropriately hammy as Rita.,0
214,"It wasn't anything groundbreaking, sure. But it was good fun that had the nostalgia rocking out. The Megazord *supplexed* Goldar and they *slapped Rita into fucking space*. If nothing else, this movie ended strong.  I went into the movie wanting to see Power Rangers punch things and drive Zords. I got Power Rangers punching things and driving Zords. I have zero complaints about this movie. Did anyone else's crowds go absolutely bonkers when the actual Power Rangers theme played?? This movie was honestly way better than I expected it to be. I actually gave a shit about each of the Rangers. Props to them all!  My favorite thing about the movie was how Elizabeth Banks wandered around town incoherently mumbling ""crystals, gold, Krispy Kreme. "" Pink ranger always making me fall in love 😊 I'll echo the sentiments of everyone else.  Very surprised at how not bad it was.  I believe most people left the theater enjoying it.  I wish I knew about the mid credits scene.  I didn't get to see it.  Goddamn. This shit actually worked. I'm really glad they avoided a romance between Jason and Kim. I was smiling the entire time and I can't wait to see it again.  I hated how good it was. I went in not expecting much, the trailers made it seem like the gritty reboot we didn't want. ",0
215,"But Jesus Christ, this movie. It does thing so well. It's shot interestingly (the beginning car chase really stands out to me), it's edited together actually coherently, the effects are just beyond great, and more importantly...the characters are amazing. ",0
216,"I have a brother on the spectrum so when I heard someone was on it, I hoped they did it justice and didn't hamfist it. I loved how it, along with Trini's lesbianism, aren't *the main aspects* of their characters. That really shines when they're around the campfire and sharing secrets. We expect Billy to say that since he only ever told Jason at the start...but nope. And when Trini says it, it's not forced and she goes out of her way to say she hates the labels her parents give 'em and actively avoids them. ",0
217,"It weaved cheese-factor and realism together in a way I didn't think possible. Rita bitch slapped into space, literally crying when Billy dies because we all expected him to come back on the docks right?, and the actual theme song playing when they're in the zords after they have the most feel-good-we're-a-team-moment ever.",0
218,"I worry people went in expecting an hour and a half of a power rangers TV show, that would get old for me. Nope, we got a full movie with characters I actually care about and related to. We've all been Jason Scott, screwed up big time and have to face our parents. We've all been Billy, a little eccentric and picked on. We've all been Trini, trying to find ourselves. We've all been Zack, doing what we think is right even if it doesn't really benefit us immediately. And we've all been Kimberly, done shitty, mean things and had to live with it but come to accept we're not shitty people.",0
219,"I'm actually blown away by how good this fucking movie is. Maybe it's my inner-child, maybe it's me tired of the dark and real movies, or how formulaic super hero movies are, or maybe it was my amazing theater packed with kids, teens, college kids, and adults alike. But I can't find anything truly, glaringly, wrong with it that warrants giving it bad marks. ",0

I was so glad that the main message was not another generic ""chase your dream"" but rather about family The Frida Kahlo part was brilliant, I could completely see it as something she would do, especially being a metaphor for birth where she gives birth to herself and then feeds her own selves. Also, fire! I’d kill for high quality stills of the city of the dead. ",0
235,"They talked about how they made it the beginning of the movie and they weren’t exaggerating it’s beauty.  Those last 10 minutes. Crying my eyes out. Incredible movie. But fuck that frozen short.  When the true reason Remember Me was written was shown, me and my girlfriend couldn't keep it together. The film was beautifully animated, the songs were sung gorgeously and the story reminded me so much of my own family in Mexico that I couldnt help but relate to a lot of Miguel's life. One of the best Pixar films in the last decade for me, hands down, and I cant wait to go re-watch it with my Father to get his reaction! I know it was a minor scene, but when Chicharrón was forgotten. It was such a poignant and moving scene, especially the drink. This is likely to be my favorite movie of all time.  I'm a 37 year old Mexican American, and although I'm no longer the Miguel, I identified with his family so much.  His abuela is MY abuela.  Mama Coco is my Mama Antonia.  I recently lost my grandfather just under a year ago, and this film reminded me of him so much.  He was always big about Dia de Los Muertos and would go back to Mexico every year to visit his parents graves.  ",0
236,"There's just so much that I identified with in this film.  From the chancla, to the Abuela always wanting to feed you, to every freaking detail that they got right.  I feel so thankful for Pixar having made this movie.   The amount of complaints I have gotten at my theater because of the Frozen short is unreal. ",0

Towards the end I thought I finally got through a Disney Pixar movie with my heart unscathed.. and then Miguel sang to Mamá Coco. My showing started at 7. The movie actually started at 7:40.  I'm actually quite surprised that this film went into dark territory with Ernesto and Hector's deaths. I also did not expect to hate the ever-loving fuck out of Ernesto by the end of this film. It was such a nice turning of the tables. Pixar, you did it once again.",0
251,Me watching the trailer: Interesting. I wonder what the movie is about.,0
252,"After watching the movie: Interesting. I wonder what the movie is about what was the smell in the back of the Tulsey Town if it wasn’t varnishing? That ""Directed by Robert Zemeckis"" bit cracked me up, idk why [deleted] Not having read any other comments, my wife and I came up with the interpretation that the whole movie is the wandering mind of the janitor while he cleans the school. There's definitely a lot being said, but the structure of the movie falls into place. He still lives at home and takes care of his elderly parents. His thermos is at the front door. His work clothes are in the laundry. ",0
253,"He's imagining or remembering past girlfriends as an idealized woman who is a painter, poet, biologist, physicist. The paintings and poems are all from his house. Her name always changes. He knows all her references, she knows none of his. These relationships always fail. At one point after he is done watching the movie at work, she is replaced by the actress. However these relationships are never comfortable and never work out. ",0
254,"He was a diligent young man, but never had the acumen to get away from the brutal, lonely life on the farm. Every day he stops at the ice cream place, where the girls in high school make fun of him, to bet a Brr and throws it in the trash when he gets to work. He imagines a dance number, accepts the Nobel prize while sweeping the stage, then sings a beautiful show number. ",0
255,"He thinks of committing suicide from hypothermia in his car, but then comes back after sleeping in the school and starts up his car to go home and start it all over again. Just finished this. If I'm being honest, I really think I'm not smart enough to even remotely comprehend what I saw. ",0
256,But there were parts I appreciated like the dance scene and obviously all the acting was good. Jessie Buckley was very good. ,0
257,"It's times like this that I appreciate how out of my element I am as a movie fan or even an art appreciator. I'm reminded that I'm just a random pleb who watches a couple more movies than the average person, not a true film connoisseur or cinephile. I think I will revisit Kaufman in about ten years when I'm older and hopefully a bit more knowledgeable and intelligent and maybe his work will connect with me then. Shout out to Jessie Plemons for nailing the ultimate Philip Seymour Hoffman role. Scratches on the basement door??? I’m tired of turning my lights on at 2 AM to make sure Toni Collette isn’t watching me sleep at night there were a couple times when she looked right into the camera which was pretty unsettling but I was loving it Why were all the title fonts so tiny? You trying to hurt my eyes Charlie? I haven't been able to stop thinking of this movie.",0
258,Spoilers ahead:,0
259,"I never read the book, so I have no other context other than the movie, but I think it became clear towards the end that that everything outside of the some of the scenes with the Janitor are the complete fantasy of the Janitor himself, who is in fact Jake at an older age. Apologies if this is obvious to most people.",0
260,"The Janitor's life is shown in a few quick snapshots. We see that he is aged. We see that he lives alone. We see that he works as a janitor at a High School where the students don't respect him, make fun of him, or are creeped out by him. He is not living a satisfying life, and as his life approaches its end, it becomes clear to him that there is little he can do change things.",0
261,"Instead of trying to change things, he does what he has probably done for most of his life, which is to use fantasy to try to construct a potentially better life. It is hinted at in dialogue that Jake/the Janitor has probably been lonely and socially awkward for most of their life. His mother says that he never had many friends in childhood or adulthood, and it seems clear that he is not comfortable around people.",0
262,"This brings us to his fixation on the Young Woman, sometimes called Lucy or Louisa or Lucille. I think that a portion of the story that she tells about their first meeting at the dinner table is accurate. It is likely that Jake did go to a a trivia night and did see the young woman and maybe even exchanged a few words with her. I doubt there was anything beyond this, but it was enough to begin a fixation within Jake. He probably first admonished himself for not asking for her number. This grew into something more and at some point in his life, he began to think of this moment as the last time he could have done something in order to have a happy life. If he had just asked for her number, or if she had asked for his, everything could be different.",0
263,"Everything we see of the Young Woman and Jake's relationship in the movie is Jake creating elaborate fantasies about how the relationship could have worked out. This accounts the various changes in the Young Woman's character throughout the movie. He always fantasizes that she is intelligent and creative. Sometimes this means that she is a poet, sometimes a painter, sometimes a physicist, but she is always idealized in some way. In a monologue near the end, the Young Woman addresses this. In the fantasy Jake is always smarter than he is, and the Young Woman is always perfect, not necessarily because he wants her to be perfect, but because he wants her to be respected, which in turn would bestow respect on him, something he dearly desires.",0
264,It also accounts for the name changes. He never actually got the Young Woman's name so it changes throughout the movie and as his fantasy develops. It also indicates how little Jake actually knows about the woman he has constructed his fantasies around. She is a complete blank slate that any characteristics can be applied to.,0
265,"I think it's interesting that even deep within Jake's fantasies, the relationship is still imperfect. He imagines fights and even that the Young Woman may not want to be in a relationship with him at all. This is likely the insecurities, depression, and anxiety that have plagued Jake for all of his life coming through in his fantasies. He is a person who feels unworthy of other people's love and affection, and it is likely these feelings that have stunted all of his relationships throughout his life. Even attempting to create a fantasy in which he is happy is difficult for him to do.",0
266,"Throughout the movie the phrase ""I'm thinking of ending things"" is thought by the Young Woman in reference to their relationship. At the end this takes on a new meaning, of Jake/the Janitor ending their life. I think it is very likely that he does in fact do this at the end of the movie, ending his unhappiness and regrets.",0
267,"What I'm less certain about is what the overall theme of the movie is. It could be about missed opportunities, but I think that's too simple. There is no indication that had Jake actually asked for the Young Woman's number that his life would have been any different, or that he would have somehow been saved from a life of unhappiness.",0
268,"I think more generally it is about allowing depression and anxiety to take control of your life, which in turn makes life unfulfilling and full of regret.",0
269,This is a deeply sad movie and the Janitor is a truly tragic figure. Unfortunately I think there are far more people like the Janitor than we realize. People who suffer inside of their own heads day in and day out while never letting anybody else in. Imagine being the unnamed girl from Jake’s fantasy. ,0
270,Having no idea that you are such a potent part of the death and mental decay in a person you don’t even know exists.,0
271,"The girl is probably nothing like Jake’s “girlfriend”. Also, just a question, but when the Janitor Jake asks her about her boyfriend, do we hear from the real girl’s voice? Like when she compared Jake to a mosquito and said that she was celebrating her anniversary with her girlfriend. Whose voice was that? If anyone can explain to me what the ice-cream girl's line about the smell not being varnish means, it would be greatly appreciated. The whole sequence with her, and the apparent overlap between the Young Woman and Jake is what I'm struggling with the most rn Her poem was absolutely hilarious IMO..",0
272,"It's like ""ahh I'm kinda a poet"" he's like let's hear the new one! ""Nah!"" Come on let's hear it!",0
273,"Then she goes into this shockingly devastatingly depressing poem that goes on fucking FOREVER and somehow just keeps getting darker lol that was amazing That dinner scene was fucking batshit, yet oddly relatable and real in a way. Kauffman really captured an awkward 'meeting the parents' then cranked the creepiness up to 11. This was by far a movie. This really hit me hard. I'm not sure if what I'll describe below was the precise intention of the movie, but the film reminds me of how I used to exist in the world when I was younger. Getting over this type of thinking was basically the most important feature of becoming an adult for me, as well as escaping from frequent anxiety I felt when I was younger.",0
274,"Up until around my early/mid-20s, I basically performed my life for an imagined audience. I didn't think of it in this way until I started recognizing it and trying to force myself to stop doing it so much. It sounds cheesy, but I had to force myself to ""live for myself"" in order to stop being anxious all the time and feel comfortable enough to pursue what I wanted to do in life. The first time I noticed it was when I studied abroad in Argentina in college, and I was going to fly from Buenos Aires to Ushuaia (southern tip) and backpack toward BA for two weeks with my roommate from the US. My roommate canceled last minute, so I had to decide whether I would fly to Ushuaia alone or also cancel. I couldn't explain to him why I was so anxious to go alone. After a few days of backpacking alone and feeling very eerily ""alone for the first time ever"", I kept noticing that I was behaving as if people I knew were watching me, even though, I literally knew zero people for 1,000 miles in any direction. It was the first time I was not with someone I knew for more than a day or two, and I was surprised that I was still inventing or imagining the people in my life to watch me in order to judge whether my actions were worthwhile or not. It's not like I literally imagined them, but I non-linguistically sort of guessed what ""my people"" would think about everything I did or thought. Actually being alone gave me a lot of anxiety at first, because I kept feeling like ""what the hell am I doing?"". But after a while I realized that the source of that feeling was stemming from my interpretation of my life through an imagined ""my people"". I didn't notice it until I was actually alone and could separate actual people from this imagined version that I used to harshly judge myself. I think doing this is inherently human, and nobody gets over it all the way. But I did it way too much, and the shock of being totally alone at the southern tip of Argentina was what allowed me to identify it and start to work it out of my system over the following years.  ",0
275,"This process of imagining some observer in order to interpret oneself to judge oneself is how I understood the film until I read some articles after. The ""my people"" I passively imagined were a sort of ""normal people soup"" that my brain came up with from popular or likable classmates (especially women), as well as characters from books and movies. I felt like the young woman was basically an imagined person that the young man was using to assess his life in order to determine whether he should kill himself. I recognized the negative self-judgement through the imagined eyes of others as something I did to a great degree when I was younger. I think if I hadn't started working on it I might have ended up being an unhappy person like the main character.  ",0
276,"(I apologize if this comes off as a humble brag that I traveled in Argentina. I imagine the realization could come without access to privileged and bourgie experiences, but that's how it happened for me. I hope this post might help someone who needs to do so come to the realization I came to, actually.) Jessie Buckley is so great man. Her performance in this, every laugh, or line delivery increases the feeling of dread and anxiousness so effectively. Especially from when they start driving to the high school. Hi I have a few questions first of all what the fuck ",0
277,"To me, the book and also the movie are about lost chances. ",0
278,He lost the chance of talking to the “Young Woman”. ,0
279,"He lost the chance to be a teacher and eventually became the janitor and stayed in that job, well, obviously until very old. ",0
280,"It seems to me that he also lost the opportunity to see his parents getting old and also lost the chance of supporting them when they needed him. That’s speculation, because it’s not really implied, maybe just a little when he’s in his truck and remembers very briefly a scene with his parents. ",0
281,"I don’t think he has a disorder per se. It seems to me that he’s just really lonely and everything happened in his head. That makes everything only worst and very, very, very depressing. I watched Tenet the other day and actually understood the plot so I was feeling pretty smart. Then I watched this and remembered I'm a fucking idiot. I still really liked it though. I found this movie to be incredibly sad and heartbreaking. It’s basically an old man both reflecting on his life but also bombarding his own thoughts with a made up fantasy. Jake is a sad, lonely janitor with nothing going for him and no one in his life. Everything happening in the movie is just him creating this fantasy life with a woman to help cope with himself. She’s the only thing keeping him alive, and her reflections on their relationship is basically his own self-reflections on his life. Shes starting to not see any reason to stay with him, and that’s basically just Jake not seeing any reason to continue living. The scene close to the end with the girl speaking to the janitor about how she didn’t remember the guy from the bar and how he was basically just a mosquito was Jake throwing out his last shred of self-worth. When she hugged him and left, he was recognizing her for what she was, a fantasy. The only thing that was left was to end things (his own life).",0
282,"The saddest scene in my opinion was the janitor sitting there alone watching that lame romantic film, because it’s basically just fuel for his continued fantasies, hence the actress in the fake movie briefly replacing Jessie’s character in one scene. To anyone who’s been in a real relationship, that film clip came off as corny and dumb, but to Jake it’s something he admired and craved (hence the actresses appearance in his own fantasy). I kind of compare that to how certain people interpret “500 Days of Summer” *very* differently.",0
283,I also think that whole scene with the father talking to the woman about paintings and how literal he needs them to be was Kaufman taking the piss out of the audience. I really hated all the changes they made from the book. ,0
284,"They made the protagonist one of the many oddities in the movie instead of the book which made her a normal character reacting normally to all this strange shit going on around her. We think she’s a real person and that this is really happening, in this film it’s pretty clear halfway through that this is either some warped dream world, or that she’s not real. We the audience cannot relate to her or feel scared for her in the film, as she’s just another piece of symbolism. She was the only normal person in the book, and thus she acted as a conduit for us into this strange world, because she felt like a genuine person. ",0
285,"They sort of abandoned the slow build up of pure dread the book gave you. In fact, they basically took most if not all of the scary parts out. The phone calls she receives are a big deal in the book and scary as fuck. The girl at the ice cream stand with the rash is creepier because you believe her when she says they’re in danger, you have no idea this woman is just a piece of symbolism, you think she’s an actual person actually living this. In the book when they’re in the car and he sees someone watching them, it’s really fucking creepy and unsettling, because these felt like real people in the real world who were in danger. Knowing that it’s all symbolic and not real halfway through just abandoned that sense of dread and fear the book built. It’s pretty clear he had no interest in adapting the scary sections, which is depressing because they’re SO creepy in the book. ",0
286,"Up until the very last pages in the book are you convinced that all of this is really happening, in the movie you sort of realize halfway through that it’s all mostly imagery and symbolism, and that most if not all of it isn’t actually happening. I have no idea why Kaufman sort of gave up halfway through in trying to convince the audience that this is all real, and sort of just shrugs and says ‘yeah, it’s all symbolic and/or not happening the way it looks’, as evident when Jesse Buckley sees her poem in one of the books in the house and sees the parents aging 30 years within segments and shrugs it off like it’s nothing. It makes her less relatable and makes the situation less creepy when they’re basically telling you she’s not a real person from the start. As someone else here said, it loses all sense of stakes and danger. ",0
287,"It’s clear Charlie Kaufman didn’t want to make something that was scary or dread inducing and instead wanted to make something more strange and symbolic. Which is fine, I’d just probably like it better if it was closer to the book in that regard. Maybe if I hadn’t read the book and expected the same horror and dread I’d have liked the movie more. It’s not terrible just not great imo The part where the mom says something along the lines of, “you had no friends on your 50th birthday- sorry 20th birthday” showed how disappointed and how much she wanted her son to have more meaningful connections.",0
288,"I loved when one of the reporters told a protesting Jaguar to ""go back to the jungle!"" To which the Jaguar replied ""I'm from the Savanna!"". Made me think about people telling black people to ""Go back to Africa.""  That ending payoff with the speed racer was hilarious. I loved the characters in this film. The design, voice, and animation worked together to make me care. The relationship built between Judy and Nick in particular felt fleshed out and believable.",0
289,"Overall the movie was great, it was  imaginative, kept me entertained throughout while bringing up surprisingly deep ideas for a children's movie.",0
290,"The tigers may have been TOO sexy though... The scene of Judy arriving by train to Zootopia is one of the best animated scenes I've seen in years. Total sense of wonder and youthful excitement of going out in the world for the first time. The movie itself was pretty good, but I want to see more of that world they built. The city and it's diverse geographic neighbors were beautifully designed.  [after the conference](http://imgur.com/eAEqkjF) This movie was really surprising with its fair treatment of mature and current themes. No wonder why all they showed in the first trailers was that funny sloth.",0
291,"Seriously, the only flaw that kinda annoys me about this is how they forced Shakira's character for no reason but to deliver that theme song. And even then, the song is stuck in my ears. Everyone is already talking about the characters and story so I'll go and say this: THIS MOVIE IS SO INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL!",0
292,"I could tell the animators put in a ton of time to make their characters as detailed as possible in the movie posters and trailers but in the movie they take it even further. Even tiny stuff like Mr. Otterton's graying hairs, the various canines' nosepads, or even stuff like when Nick was playing around with Bellwether's hair, the movie is just bleeding with fine-combed detail. Not easy when you have just about every single kind of mammal represented.",0
293,"Even then the locale and huge range of scale within the city of Zootopia is amazing, especially since the vast majority of the film is done on Judy's and Nick's level so people like elephants or Bogo all the way down to hamsters gives the feel of such an impressive scope to everything around them. Even cooler to see how Zootopia accommodates everyone due to that fact.",0
294,"As everyone else has already said, the characters feel real in their personality, the story is a little cliche but well executed, and overall it's a solid film. I'm not sure how plausible a Zootopia 2 could be but I could easily see a lot of shorts coming out in the future even if they didn't focus on Judy/Nick just to explore the world even more. Young Nick was soooo cute! It breaks my heart to know that's probably the saddest sequence in the whole movie. Saw this film with my sister yesterday. Couple thoughts.",0
295,"1) This movie is great. Wonderful design and animation. The story is good. The voice acting is spot on on. Kudos to all involved. So, so much better than the trailers. So cute!",0
296,2) Judy Hopps is one of the most feminine characters I've seen on screen recently. The chest head-butt crying scene. That's a thing! Girls do that! ,0
297,"3) I love what they did with Gideon, the bully fox from the beginning. I know so many people who turned out like that. ",0
298,"4) This movie is smart. It takes its chosen issues head on, but in a way that lets everyone feel like it's talking about them. As someone else said, it's not about the racism or sexism of a specific time and place, it's about the ideas as a whole, and shows how everyone experiences prejudice in one way or another.",0
299,"5) What a fantastic piece of propaganda. There is a moral message you are intending to push with this film, and even seeing it happening, it didn't bother me. I even liked it. ",0
300, Do I consider Zootopia one of the smartest Disney movies I've seen?,0
301,"Yes, I concur with that statement. At 428 comments my input is practically pissing into the ocean but I'll throw my two cents into it. (for reference this is from the prospective of a 17 year old guy and his friends)",0
302,"This movie is fucking fantastic. We were planning on going to see London has fallen. As a joke I said instead why don't we see Zootopia as a joke because I REALLY don't care about London has Fallen. Somehow I got everyone to agree and so we went in knowing literally nothing, other than there was a sloth in the movie at some point. We were all shocked immediately by the darker/depressing themes of giving up and settling and of course found them hilarious. ",0
303,"It turned out to be a very serious movie covered up in incredibly beautiful animation and cute animals. Also I can't stress this enough the voice acting and the animation are goddamn incredible. Personally I believe this is most well-animated movie I have seen...ever. The themes of racism, sexism, and corruption are not too heavy handed that they become annoying however they are there for anyone who may have been forced to take their kids to what was assumed to be a rather childish movie, but disney managed to make this a movie enjoyable for kids both young and old as well as adults. If you haven't even considered seeing this movie and are for some reason reading this post. GO SEE IT. I thought Finding Dory was going to be my favorite cartoon of 2016 but damn it's going to have a seriously tough time beating Zootopia. ",0
304," I love that Judy became the *Godmother* to the shrews baby. I found it really nice that they credited first the lead designers, animators, etc. at the closing credit, instead of the lead actors and actresses. It goes to show how much importance they put into the animation, which in turn, rewards the movie a beautifully designed animated universe. This has to be one of the most craftily creative 3D animations made, especially in terms of environment design. ",0
305,"That reconciliation scene between Nick and Judy when she steps out of the shade and into the light, pinpointing the exact moment of the pair reuniting. That, that was animated poetry. I loved how Judy's nose twitched every time she noticed a crime. That was the only time her nose twitched while other bunnies noses twitched during conversation. Nice visual cue that she's all about the crime stopping. Anybody catch the very end of the film where all the cops were getting their assignments? One team was assigned to go undercover and the wolf put on a sheep outfit.",0
306,*A wolf in sheep's clothing.* the two loud antelopes was my favourite gag beside the sloth gag,0

308,"""you shut up""",0
309,"""you shut up""",0
310,"""you shut up"" The sloths absolutely killed me in this film.",0
311,"Seriously, whoever came up with having sloths as DMV officials, you made the rest of the week for me. The fact that Kristen Bell voices the female sloth at the DMV kills me. Probably her dream role! ""Hold on, Walter and Jesse are at the door.""",0
312,"I thought that scene felt similar to breaking bad. I liked this movie way too much. I don't think the overall message was heavy-handed at all. The characters are so lovable. The references to other Disney films (Bogo saying ""let it go"" immediately after saying that life wasn't a musical) and other films and series (Breaking Bad and Godfather). ",0
313,"*clears throat* can't wait to get a Judy plushie  Of all the messages in the movie, the most complex message in my opinion was that you can be someone's friend and think the world of them in a particular capacity but still think that they are inferior to you due to some immutable characteristic. Judy thinks highly of Nick, believes he'd be a great cop and shouldn't let the fact that he's a fox define him, and considers him to be her friend. Almost immediately thereafter Judy speaks to the public and expresses her belief that all predators are savages and predetermined to behave in a dangerous way based on their DNA. She even admits that she finds Nick to be dangerous based on his genetics. How do these two schools of thought interact with each other? Is my friend of a different ethnicity really my friend? What if he believes I am inferior/dangerous/stupid/untrustworthy due to my ethnicity? Is he still my friend? The movie takes a position and says ""No.""",0
314,"Consider this: a person is accused of being racist for their treatment of blacks. The accused responds truthfully that there's no way she is racist because her best friend is black! Couldn't Judy have made a similar argument if she was accused of being racist? And would her argument have been persuasive? I don't think so, especially before the apology scene, because despite being friends with Nick, she holds a belief that he is inferior due to his genetics. So you, you might have good friends that are of a different ethnicity, but does that preclude you from being racist? I don't think so.  ""I'm just a dumb bunny, but we're good at multiplying""",0
315,"did.....disney just making animal sex jokes? Just saw Zootopia tonight, and it really *is* as great as everyone is saying. The movie tells a well-constructed story in a fleshed-out world, with absolutely *brilliant* design and animation, and a cast of lovable characters. It's on the high end of what you would expect from a Disney movie.",0
316,"But what really, *really* made the movie for me was the surgeon-like precision and delicacy with which it imparts general lessons about prejudice and acceptance. A lot of people have been saying the movie has allegories for racism, sexism, and the like, but I think it actually does *better* than that. You can take *any* sociological lesson away from this movie that you come into it with, and that's the real beauty of it. Can we just appreciate ginnifer's voice acting on the scene under the bridge?? LOVED this movie. The bootleg DVD scene was the best. All the ""Disney"" movies. Including a Frozen reference as the weasel name was Duke Weasleton.",0
317,The foster parents are pure wholesome and joy.,0
318,Was absolutely surprised by the appearance of the shazam family.,0
319,John glover still playing a dick father from his smallville days. That bullet immunity scene had me fucking rolling That cold shoulder from his mother was ICYYYY Something I really liked about the movie was the fact that they never explicitly said whether Billy was truly pure of heart. Having the 7 sins be freed before Billy meets Shazam was a good way to explain how a little shit like him could earn the power. ,0
320,"And when he held the power of the 7 sins at the end and seemed unphased, you can take it as him finally becoming pure of heart or maybe the 7 sins having no effect on Shazam. It's a nice message that you don't have to be perfect to be a good person. When Freddy’s superhero self immediately started flying after his first transformation, I couldn’t help but think that the disabled version of himself always “believed” he could fly and that’s why he was able to fly so much faster than Billy could T_T  Do you guys think the two jock bullies said ""no homo"" before getting on a ferris wheel ride together Everybody is talking about how great Zachary Levi is in this (and he is) but Mark Strong is fantastic as well. He plays cartoonishly menacing so well without falling into ""too ridiculous"" or ""too serious""  It’s insane to me that we’ve gotten to a point in comic book movies where they’ll put in someone as comic booky and goofy as Mister fucking Mind and play him for 100% seriousness.  I loved that they were playing Mortal Kombat X, I can only assume Billy chose Raiden. ",0
321,"It’s kinda funny cause if MKX exists, then does Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe exist? cause Shazam was in that game lmao. Zachary Levi did an absolutely phenomenal job holy crap. I fully bought that he was a fourteen year old boy in a man's body.  Billy Batson’s Mom is a better super villain than Thanos change my mind Best part (and realistic) part of the movie was that Billy and Freddy initially use Shazam to make some quick money to do stuff like buy beer and go to strip clubs. Absolutely hilarious and probably accurate for a 15 year old kid in a mans body “Yes! You guys finally figured it out!” ",0
322,"Easily my favorite line in the movie.  As brutal as the deaths in the boardroom were, to me the most shocking one was the poor scientist who turned to dust when she touched the door in Sivana’s office. Damn. Say my name scene with the family was amazingly funny at my theater.  That bus had some strong windshields.",0
323,The Shazam family coming together was one of the best superhero scenes I’ve seen in a long time. The dad didn't age... “This must be the cool security guard that all of the kids talk about” ,0
324,"“No that’s another one, this one sucks” ",0
325,"Best laugh I got out of the whole movie. Man I loved it. DC really are starting to get back on track. For a movie seemingly more kid-centric than most modern superhero movies, the 7 sin monsters were legitimately horrifying.  ♪ **Hands!** ♩",0

332,"It took awhile, but they finally got to be in a DC movie after all! Haven't seen anyone mention this, but the mom at the carnival scene really struck a cord with me, when he remembers it it's all colorful and happy and his mom is smiling but then when his mom remembers it (and since she's grown I would think her version is more accurate) it's actually kinda gloomy and she's stressed out which goes to show how we tend to look at the past through rose tinted glasses, then it got darker as not only did his mom left him as a kid but also she doesn't really want him back now either she didn't even hug him, seems to be working a dead end job (based on her waitress-like work uniform) and seems to be in a toxic relationship, hopefully she does better in future movies I honestly think one of my favorite details are the differences between the Flashback of his mother losing him at the carnival. In the first one the mother is incredibly pretty with perfect make up and is just glowing. ",0
333,"But in the ""real"" flashback from his mother's point of view. She has no makeup, looks dead tired and snaps at him when he asks about the tiger.",0

335,"""Gross""",0
336,This movie is amazing.,0
337,"Anyone else watch the whole “Truth or Dare” scene through the cracks of their fingers? Seriously couldn’t stop squirming until the lights to her front porch turned on I teared up when Kayla asked her dad if he was sad to have her as his daughter. I definitely remember feeling like that as a kid, so for her to put the notion out there and for him to reassure her that he makes her so *so* happy was very cathartic for me. kayla: i feel like if i had a daughter that turned out like me she’d make me sad",0
338,"me: stop the ride im gonna die Ironically the Truth or Dare scene in this movie was more terrifying than the entirety of the actual horror film called *Truth or Dare* The dinner date with Gabe was so hilariously wholesome, which felt needed after that truth or dare scene. I really want to know where they found that kid. ",0
339,"""You know what would go great with this? Szechuan sauce.""  It's nice to see such a positive portrayal of a single dad As a former 8th grade band geek, that national anthem was the hardest I've laughed in a theater in a long time. Fucking perfect recreation of how bad a junior band sounds. I loved it.  *takes bite of chicken tender*",0
340,"""Do you believe in God?"" Whats funny is that even if the memes weren't relevant  now, because its middle schoolers, it still workd  A lot of people mention how this really captures middle school, and all I could think while I was sobbing in theaters was how much her social isolation and anxiety reminds me of my life now -- and I'm in my late twenties.  I keep thinking I'll escape that intense loneliness and awkwardness one day, but I haven't yet. It's just repeat ad nauseum in every situation. That kid she goes on a date with at the end is 100% a redditor. One of the more heartbreaking moments in this film for me was after the scene where Riley tried to take advantage of her and she tells him ""Don't tell Olivia about this."" She thinks Olivia would find her less cool because she ""chickened out of"" ""doing stuff"" with a boy for the first time, when in reality Kayla trusted her gut, and did the right thing. Plus Olivia would have kicked that dude's ass for what he did. Olivia was the absolute best person to tell about it, and it was in Riley's best interest for her not to find out. Just devastating. So glad the high school friend didn’t turn bitch! Nice to see a cute girl portrayed as nice in a movie.  Man, this movie has some uncomfortable moments. Outside of the obvious moments (the car scene), Kayla being mean to her dad who’s just trying to support her made me really sad and, based on my own dad, worried that he was going to snap on her. But this wasn’t that kind of movie. The dad was just a super nice guy who wanted the best for his daughter. I loved that. I smiled so damn hard during the graduation scene when it looks like Kayla is about to go running after the boy in the hallway but instead goes to confront those bitchy girls  The scene where she prayed to God and just asked for the next day to be good even if the other days will be bad. I wanted to cry. I’ve done that so much as a kid, I didn’t think i’d ever see that on screen. Also, when she told her dad if he feels sad having a daughter like her...the amount of times I have said that to my mom isn’t unreal. I love that a movie finally captured all of this.  ""I can't wait to be you"" had me tearing up bad The scene with Kayla's dad while they're burning her time capsule made me cry. I wish someone had said anything like her dad's monologue to me at that age.  I really liked how her dad gave Kayla the advice to ""put herself out there"", and she initially blows it off like all teenagers. However, her next video is about putting yourself out there. I really liked that. It was an effective way of showing her dad's impact on Kayla and how she does take what he says seriously.  Gabe is my new favorite character in any movie ever... maybe because I know I was the EXACT SAME. Thank you Bo for making me confront my past self arguably TOO much The banana scene was my favorite. The whole theater was screaming.  There's been a lot of talk about how accurately the film portrays that age and modern teenage life, but I haven't heard anyone talk about what I believe to be the actual theme of the movie. Even more than awkwardness, I believe what Burnham is trying to convey is empathy. ",0
341,"I'm not a girl in her early teens; I don't even *know* any girls in their early teens. Still, this movie made me really care for Kayla and her problems in a way that most movies don't. Suspension of disbelief lets us identify with the protagonist, but usually this is in service to the plot. In Eighth Grade, the plot itself seems to be a vehicle to bring us closer to Kayla. It's also emphasized several times that one of Kayla's strengths is her empathy for the people around her, and we see this play out in her interactions with Gabe (the nerdy boy) and even Riley in the mall. Furthermore, it's usually the other character's *lack* of empathy that makes them ""villainous"": the boys seeing Kayla only as a sex object and the popular girls not seeing her at all (literally). Olivia is cool not because she's popular but because she reaches out to Kayla, sees what she's going through and tries to help.",0
342,"I believe what Bo is trying to do is instill a sense of empathy in us, the audience. And I *think* the intent is for it not just to be for Kayla during the movie, but hopefully to train us to be more empathetic in our own lives. I have to admit I'm biased in favor of that effort myself, so I may be reading too much into it there, but it wouldn't be that far out of line with other things Bo has done. His works often have a moral of sorts. And certainly Eighth Grade has made me want to care more about other people even if their problems are different than mine. I hope Elsie Fisher at least gets awards buzz for this. One of the smallest, but so real, details was that little ""blah"" noise she makes when she stumbles on or mispronounces a word in her videos. Growing up, I remember so many people nervously doing that when speaking in front of the class room. She brought that character to life. It will be a damn shame if this doesn't get attention at the Oscars. I will be very surprised if I love another movie more this year. Is no one going to mention the dabbing principal? 😂",0
343,This was captivating.  And it should make more people interested in learning more about Fred Hampton and his work.  He was truly a case of a visionary cut down way too soon (he was only 21 when he was murdered).,1
344,"Daniel, Lakeith, and Jesse Plemmons were all great in their roles as well.",1
345,"It’s not really a biopic of Hampton though, which might surprise some people. Dominique Fishback should be getting praise, I think people are carrying unfair baggage from her role in Project Power, which is not good, also because she’s not the main focus of the movie, but she should be getting Best Supporting Actress noms left and right. There have been Best Supporting actress nominations given to worse performances in the past, she deserves at least some recognition.  Kaluuya has such a strong screen presence, his speech scenes were completely magnetic and commanded the screen. He handled the softer scenes well too, especially liked when he was laughing with his girlfriend and reflecting on Emmet Till. Stanfied's performance was reserved but he nailed it, the tears in his eyes when he has to put Hampton to sleep was excellent. I enjoyed the movie, even as someone who knows a bit about the Panthers and especially the Rainbow Coalition in Chicago. I would highly recommend the documentary *American Revolution 2* (Parts [1](https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/191346), [2](https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/191347), and [3](https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/191348)) for those curious about the Rainbow Coalition, as well as [the PBS documentary](https://www.pbs.org/video/the-first-rainbow-coalition-q9hsug/). The Rainbow Coalition isn't given much attention, which disappointed me a little. But there's a lot to cover in a 2 hour movie while also telling the story of COINTELPRO. There seemed very little ""both sides"" kind of stuff going on. The police were absolutely villains throughout, as they should be. Which I appreciated. I can already predict the outrage from right-wingers and police unions about the depiction of killings of police officers. While there wasn't needless both sides kind of stuff, there obviously was the humanizing of O'Neal and the depiction of Mitchell in some shades of grey. But I think it does well to show the insidious way the system gets people to carry out oppression.",1
346,"One very small detail of the movie that I appreciated was the reference to [intercommunalism](https://viewpointmag.com/2018/06/11/intercommunalism-the-late-theorizations-of-huey-p-newton-chief-theoretician-of-the-black-panther-party/) at the beginning of the film. [There's a good talk over this theory developed by Huey P Newton by the author of the linked article](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bpS49ytdm4). The way various Panthers developed theories of revolutionary socialism I am also interested in, [like Lorenzo Komboa Ervin](https://blackrosefed.org/announcing-black-autonomy-podcast/) who is still around. [Kuwasi Balagoon](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273895582_Maroon_Kuwasi_Balagoon_and_the_Evolution_of_Revolutionary_New_Afrikan_Anarchism) is another who is no longer around, who [has inspired](https://cooperationjackson.org/lumumba-center) groups like [Cooperation Jackson](https://cooperationjackson.org/) that [build and fight for a better world](https://truthout.org/articles/build-and-fight-the-program-and-strategy-of-cooperation-jackson/). Many Panthers are still incarcerated [or did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o05OYFKHpew) very long [stints in prison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxxnjlJ2nNo). [The Jericho Movement](https://thejerichomovement.com/) was [founded by ex-Panthers](https://www.treyfpodcast.com/2020/07/28/47-ashanti-alston/) that [now support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKrpMLDyev0) the many political prisoners from various movements. The [echoes of the Panthers and their politics run through anti-prison movements today](https://incarceratedworkers.org/freedom-first), which are [happening right now](https://rampantmag.com/2021/02/09/this-is-genocide/). Anyone catch how when Mitchell was handing Bill the keys to the gas station, it looked like silver pieces? Kaluuya was captivating from start to finish. Also Plemmons once again nailing this role of seemingly harmless yet deeply disturbing villain. Gave me vibes of Todd from Breaking Bad where he seems gentle but clearly inside he's void and capable of some messed up stuff. The scene where Bill asks if he's going to kill Fred was so heartbreaking. It was that desperation in Bill's voice ""you won, what more do you want"" and Plemmons' soulless eyes that really made it clear who he was. Damn I loved this movie. Kaluuya and Stanfield were amazing of course. I specifically loved Kaluuya’s take on Fred Hampton. The way he just observes and hangs on to every word someone is saying in a conversation is a great touch. ",1
347,"I also loved how Shaka King explores the Black Panther Party in this. The scene where Ms. Winters is grieving over her son and says something along the lines of “Yeah he did that...but that shouldn’t be his legacy.” I took that as to how the Black Panthers are still viewed today. Yeah they were militant, and they took extreme measures in practicing their second amendment rights; but they did so protecting their neighborhoods from a tyrannical unjust system, the amount of good they did for the people in their neighborhoods shouldn’t be overlooked, from the money they put into it and the clinics they’ve built. ",1
348,"Anyway, great film. Definitely will be taking advantage of its HBO Max run. The ‘I AM A REVOLUTIONARY’ scene inside the church is absolutely phenomenal. Not only is Kaluuya’s performance incredible but the scene has so much stakes involved for All the characters that elevates this very powerful Hampton speech to an amazing scene. With constant shots to Fred’s pregnant girlfriend, as well as the back and forth between Stanfield and Plemmons the tension keeps rising to a fever pitch, the scene is just perfect. That scene in the prison where the guy has RABBLE ROUSER carved into his chest really drove fear into me. Jesus, what a performance from Daniel Kaluuya and what a shocking story (I'm not from America and didn't know of this movement). This film was quite a surprise for me, I thought it was brilliant. Man, I haven't watched a movie like this in a while where I just needed to stare into the void after finishing it and just think. Fred Hampton was 21 years old when he died... Wow. That blew my mind. Great acting and compelling story that will be new to a lot of people. But it also felt really surface level at points in depicting Fred Hampton's life, the Rainbow Coalition, how the BPP served their community, their beliefs, and the depth of what COINTELPRO did. Hey Reddit I'm late to the page, but as a producer on this movie just want to thank everyone for watching and for discussing as always.",1
349,"I HIGHLY recommend the official podcast that we also produced that goes far deeper into the Black Panther party during this time, as well as some fascinating information about how we put the film together along with Chairman Fred Hampton Jr.s' support.",1
350,"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/judas-and-the-black-messiah-podcast/id1549883019 Kaluuya deserves to win the Oscar, he’s put in many phenomenal performances over the past few years. Also, thank you HBO Max for not being totally greedy like Disney and allowing the public to watch these impactful films. I believe the Lucas Bros., the twins from 22 Jump Street, have writing credits on this as well. Masterclass performances by Kaluuya and Stanfield. Cinematography was sharp and stunning, felt like I was watching an art house film at times. The use of old footage overlaid with speeches and chants was extremely effective. Definitely a front runner for oscars. The climactic scene where Hampton is unconscious while all this shit is going down just turned my stomach. Awful (but brilliantly done). Outstanding movie that deserves the highest level of recognition possible. Stanfield and Kaluuya were incredible. Also, Deborah Johnson was a great supporting actress as well. I think she should be nominated. Cinematography and soundtrack for this were pristine as well.",1
351,This movie is perfect timing and I agree with one of the movie critics who said that this movie doesn't hold back in showing police as the true villains during the civil rights movement.,1
352,"Just the fact that they manipulated a 17 year old to infiltrate the Black Panthers to not only imprison a 23-year-old Fred Hampton, but also to murder him speaks volumes for why black people feel the way we do about law enforcement. It also illustrates them planting a crabs in a barrel mentality in the black community. They cornered O'neal to poison him and give up the blueprint to his location. ",1

360,"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/litkiu/discussion_judas_and_the_black_messiah Daniel Kaluuya deserves every award he could possibly get for his portrayal of Fred Hampton. There were times when he wasn't onscreen that I legitimately missed his presence; that's how you know he was fantastic. Kaluuya was amazing; His best performance yet. But, this movie and movies like it are always tough, even more so due to the fact that my mother, a former Black Panther, passed away last year due dementia. She is the strongest person I've ever known and we were best friends. ",1
361,"The leg work the FBI did to destroy and dismantle just about every black empowerment  movement crushes me every time I'm reminded of it. My mother was an angel, but what she endured when she moved from Jersey to Georgia was terrible. Racists being in power have this God-forsaken phobia of minorities, and the means to which they will take to eradicate any movement is absolutely ridiculous. Hoover and racists like him always made it seem like the safety of the country is dependent on minorities being oppressed (a tactic still used till this day). But, each movement (NAACP, Black Panther etc)  was sparked by the murder of Emmitt Till and the thousands of other senseless murders of minorities. This country will never get to where it needs to be until the powers that be listen with open ears to people who can convey the ""Black"" experience properly with the goal of putting pieces in place to eliminate this state and corporate-sanctioned bigotry hatred. This America that we are in now is better than the one my mother grew up in, but we still have a lonngggg way to go.",1
362,"This film did a great job of conveying why the Black Panthers existed; It was never to push fear, only preservation. Hampton Jr. was robbed of a father, the nation was robbed of a Kennedy, of a King, all because of this phobia of minorities.",1
363,"I miss you mom... I still don't like framing the film through O'Neal's perspective (for a variety of reasons) but this film might not have gotten made otherwise. Shout out to Chairman Fred Hampton Jr. for being on set pretty much every day and correcting all kinds of misinformation, even when Warner Bros. tried to stop him (and shout out to Ryan Coogler for fighting for him to stay involved). A lot of people don't realize how different this film is due to Chairman Fred Jr. fighting battles day in and day out. A few facts I'd like to highlight that aren't necessarily presented in the film are 1) O'Neal was not the only informant, in fact it is believed that Mitchell alone had 9 others who are still not identified, and 2) COINTELPRO didn't die with Hoover, these are systemic tactics that the State utilizes to this day. Chairman Fred Sr.'s tombstone is shot up by cops regularly, and there are a number of Black Panther Party members who were targeted that are still locked up as political prisoners to this day.",1
364,"From a historical standpoint it may not be perfect, but as Chairman Fred Jr. told me a few days ago, ""You can't put a shark in a fish tank"". I hope the film performs well and opens the door for future projects that can more fully flesh out the politics of the Black Panther Party (imagine a series focusing on different BPP Chapters per season!). In the meantime I look forward to the discussions of the film and strongly encourage people to research the subject. For a good start I'll recommend watching the documentaries [The Murder of Fred Hampton](https://vimeo.com/434141029) and [All Power to the People](https://youtu.be/pKvE6_s0jy0), and be sure to check out [the Judas and the Black Messiah Podcast](https://medium.com/prxofficial/proximity-99-invisible-and-warner-bros-15e4d6ac8b4c) that provides historical context from Chairman Fred Jr. and actual members of the Illinois Chapter of the BPP.",1

I’d watch a whole movie of just Mrs. Crawly This movie was honestly fire This was incredibly emotionally manipulative and boy oh boy did it work This was like a 7/10 but the guy next to me kept dancing and singing and I honestly found it endearing so it bumped up to a 8.,0

I can't believe they didn't call this movie Sing Sing To anyone that has seen it, how was Eric Andre’s performance and how much is he in the film? He and Egerton are my main draw to see it. I legitimately just left a sold out showing of this where everyone clapped at the end. Blew my mind. It was good fun but there’s no way the kids in the theater knew half of those songs.",0

379,"* Taron Egerton and Tori Kelly's cover of ""There's Nothing Holding Me Back"" slaps more than it has any right to, with Tori in particular killing those high notes. Where the hell was Eddie!?!?!?! were the songs good as they were in the first one? johnny played some fire elton john I like how Mr Crystals right hand man fell in love with him after seeing that wolf pack of his I can absolutely see Halsey switching from full-time singer to full-time actor in the very near future Better than the original. I hope they make a 3rd one. The covers are incredible. Especially the final song with Bono. Any confirmation that Mike died in the first one? I liked the film. The first Sing has a special place in my heart for whatever reason, just tickled me in a way, and Sing 2 was much the same with a few exceptions. I really liked the story around the lion, but I wish they'd focused on that storyline more. I think the story was really powerful but it's literally told across like...3 scenes. I wish they'd cut some other stuff out to more fully explore that story, and I would have liked to see a little more interaction between him and Ash to establish how she got him to overcome his grief and such. I think the elephant's subplot was unnecessary, and the murderous wolf guy was kind of an insane thing to add, I think if both these things had been reduced and the story focused more on the lion it would have been a bit stronger.",0
380,"That being said, the gorilla's subplot was good and his song was incredibly well done! That cover was nuts. I liked Portia's storyline too. I kind of adored that Ash went from an arc of healing in the first movie to the arc of helping someone else heal in the second movie, I think that was a good progression for her character. Koala was kind of annoying, but I actually kind of appreciate an unlikeable protagonist every now and then, it's especially interesting to see that in a kid's movie. Overall I think this movie and the first Sing are probably some of the best work Illumination has put out since the first Despicable Me, which isn't saying much, but they're both solid kids movies that try to do a little more than ""fart joke haha"" which I really appreciate. Are the Japanese Red Pandas from the first one back? I loved it. Gorgeous animation and great use of the songs and singers. Wow. Did not expect it to be this good. Almost got teary in some parts and Halsey was amazing. There are much fewer comments here than I expected. I really enjoyed this movie. The singing and designs were great!

I didn't really know how to take it to be honest. I don't know who was dead, whether it was heaven or hell, what the meaning was. Still a good, eerie story.

410,"Freddie Mercury absolute Legend. The Live Aid sequence was fucking amazing. The best part of the movie by far was when Freddy kisses the first guy and the girl in front of me yelped out ""WHAT!"" like it was the most shocking thing to find out that he was gay,  causing the entire theater to laugh at her. The “I’m In Love With My Car” running joke was hilarious to me, especially when that radio DJ mistook it for the main single “the other side” LMAO I felt like I was actually watching a younger version of Brian May, it was that uncanny. Sure, the story itself might not have been that good. But goddamn the music, and the acting was fantastic. The live aid scene brought a tear to my eye. I was a big fan of all of the cats in this movie. Watching it, I was pretty sure they cloned and cultivated a younger Brian May. Holy fuck was that casting spot on. As someone who was born after the events of this movie and doesn't know much about the history of the band itself, I really enjoyed this film. I did get the sense that it kept teasing important moments & stories but sort of glossed over them because it had to keep moving. And it did feel like the story was a little too neatly organized & wrapped up at the end, but hey, it's a film, not a documentary. I thought the acting was phenomenal, especially Rami as Freddie. The wild, flamboyant side of Freddie was really fun to watch, and I really felt his loneliness as the movie went on. Showing the entire Live Aid performance at the end was a nice touch.  The chicken-galileo shot though The crowd at Live Aid was very uncanny valley, it looked like a guitar hero crowd.  The opening credits with Freddie getting ready for Live Aid was hauntingly beautiful I just have to say the choice to play ""Who Wants to Live Forever"" while Freddie Mercury goes to the hospital to get the diagnosis that he has Aids.  It's so powerful and works on so many levels.  I didn't expect that at all.  The tragedy and sadness of it all is felt 100%.",1
411,This movie doesn't work as a documentary.  But it does work wonderfully as a musical set around the rise of the band and Freddie Mercury.  And that's really all I want from a movie about Queen that's 2 hrs and 15 mins long. Brian May doing the opening 20th Century Fox theme was great.  ,1
412,I think the casting department was spot on with picking the right people for the band. Didn't know the kid from Jurassic Park was going to be in the film so seeing him do a good job of John Deacon was a surprise.  ,1

414,"It doesn't venture into too much depth at times, particularly the first half of the movie but it really picks up towards the end.   Y'all, how did they get Brian May to play Brian May? Was amused at the casting choice of Littlefinger as the band's first manager",1

It was just...Freddie. ",1

[deleted] My biggest gripe with this movie is that it made Freddie's genius seem effortless...and perhaps it was....but he just kind of shows up brilliant aside from that first concert which still was great. I guess you can't really fit the nuance of writing masterpieces into a movie's run time and they attempted slightly with bohemian rapsody's motif, but that's my biggest complaint.

421,"“You’re projecting a lot of misogyny for a future women’s march organizer.” 75 minute long anxiety nightmare. Loved it. The music was really something Thought this movie was fantastic. Reminded me of Uncut Gems but with just a completely different setting and scale. Gasped a few times as complications were piled on (getting the phone back was brilliant!). Kinda want to rewatch it just to soak in the tension. Shiva Baby is a GREAT debut! Shows some everyday realities of being female, college-aged, and belonging to a “liberal”-minded, but still quite overwhelming, Jewish family niche in the modern world. And I think it shows the insular world of this particular tiny slice of humanity—Jewish-American college girls, so well. ",0
422,"Even small, very subtle details, like, for instance, Danielle’s straightened hair at the beginning of the movie with Max, vs her natural hair, for the rest of it, are a punch. Straightening hair (read: damaging hair) is a rite of passage  in “coastal elite Jewish-American girl” culture. Many Jewish girls have naturally curly, unruly hair, coming into conflict with what society, especially younger society, thinks female hair should look like. The fact that Danielle had specifically straightened her hair for her sugar daddy date already shows me her mentality: nobody wants a sugar baby with curly, “unsexy,” “Jew” hair. It tells me that Danielle is the type of girl who desperately wants to feel beautiful, and is also the type to conform to society’s standards in order to do so.  All that, and more, from the first 5 minutes of the movie. ",0
423,"To paraphrase Jon Frosch from Hollywood Reporter, it ain’t “The Hours”-deep, nor is it prolly really meant to be, as a comedic horror movie. Notwithstanding, really enjoyed the nuanced ways the movie brought up different themes, even if it didn’t explore them as much as I’d have liked to see. And it does play on stereotypes quite a lot. But, in the end, the actors are so great in their stereotyped roles, you’re left remembering your own “shiva baby-like” family encounter, no matter if you pronounce it “rugelach” or “arugula.” impressive debut feature This was great, so funny, tense and awkward. Can't wait to see more from this young director “oh so you can run marches, like with the pink pussy hats?” Not watching this ever again. It just made me feel sick.  ",0
424,"Great film though. The best way I could pitch this film is that it's Noah Baumbach meets the Safdie Brothers with the Judaism somehow doubled. Pretty great actually. My only complaint would be the compositions are so whacky, floaty and hand held that sort of diminish the effort a bit as a whole. I know they are thematically tied to the anxiety inducing vibe, but I've been noticing that a lot of filmmakers utilise the technique in many new films, basically for the same reasons, and I'd argue that there are other much more exciting ways to convey chaos through composition. ",0
425,"There's certainly an argument to be had that there isn't a single memorable shot in the film, and, considering we are talking about the cinematic medium, that's a little unfair to an otherwise great story, with focused performances. Enjoyable quick film, funny and cringe. Felt old when they referred to  Dianna Agron as old lol Super good dialogue. A bit of it hit a little close to him so I don’t see myself watching again. Some of the camera work was really shaky especially in the beginning. But the main actress was fantastic. I know this movie is getting heavy praise particularly for it's bisexual representation, but for me, I loved it for it's Jewish-American representation. Just everything about it perfectly captured the vibe I always feel at extended family events that I don't really wanna be at because I barely know anyone.",0
426,"Everything from the decor of the house to the food on the table brought back memories for me, and the whole ""Jewish family gathering edited as a horror movie"" really felt relatable. >""*Did I say this was a love story? No. It's a horror movie*."" - **Deadpool**",0
427,"This film is as chaotic and stress inducing as '**mother!**' minus the supernatural fantasy elements and metaphors. Cringe, but in a deliberately fun way. I see it described everywhere as a young woman encounters her ""sugar daddy"" at a shiva. Even since the short film that had been the pitch.",0
428,"But is there any setup for it actually being a ""sugar baby"" type scenario? It just seems like she is a prostitute and he is a client. That was great. Not many movies can pull off the couple of hour time frame without feeling forced. Good acting and good direction. Mazel tov! Thoroughly enjoyed it, the dialogue was very Baumbach-esque. The entire movie felt like Mother! meets Frances Ha As a neat freak person this film was agonising to watch. No personal space.. everyone needed a good shower.. I wanted to go out and get some air. Made me appreciate my not so close ties with my family. Good movie indeed I don't think I've seen a movie that so accurately reflected my own personal anxieties of growing into adulthood than this. All those expectations of family and even family acquaintances and feeling like all you're going to do is disappoint them. I love how the director was going to take what in other instances would feel like a result of a small budget with the really tight handheld camera and make it a stylistic choice that adds to that stressful tone of the movie.

429,"I'm glad this seems to be getting such a warm reception cause I really want Emma Seligman to have the opportunity to make more stuff like this that has such a strong sense of purpose and voice. It was a great movie but one part has me baffled. What was Kim going to give Danielle when she asked her to hold the child. Apparently it seemed important because she didn't want max to have the child either. Kim gave her back her phone. I assume Kim saw her sugar daddy business popped up on the phone also, so was she going to assist her? Give her tips? I'm really surprised that scene didn't continue.",0

I just watched the film yesterday. It was great! The tension build up was amazing. I loved it!!!

435,"Overall it felt way too unfocused and all over the place, first 30-40 minutes is just jumping through events and plot points, then the russian quest, then the 1917-like detour... it was just so weird. The Rasputin scenes were hilarious. The funny thing is Rasputin's actual death was way more ridiculous than what they came up with in this movie. From a quick browse of this thread, my opinion will be controversial, but I enjoyed it. Very different to the first two and quite glib and (successful or not at least attempting to be) poignant at times. I can see how this ultimately evolved in to the tongue in cheek Eggsy era. It felt like it created the necessary Monarchs losing their next of kin sadness to precipitate Kingsman’s founding. Also nice to see an actual effectual death in a universe where no one dies. It had its flaws and I will be honest I have a massive Gemma Arterton crush, but I can see what they were trying to achieve here. That no man's land scene was absolutely the highlight for me due to its suspenful structure and sheer brutality of it all like I did not expect the film to go that dark. Also the way Conrad died because of a misunderstanding just felt so insanely cruel and unexpected but it did serve well with showing how random and heart breaking war can be to anyone really. Great stuff 👏 Would love an explanation on how a spy ring that includes the king of England is supposed to be independent of governments. Omg this quote from  [the APNews review](https://apnews.com/article/film-reviews-entertainment-movies-julianne-moore-world-war-i-c3bd4ab4fb2dfb0efa732147e2902df1) had me dead",0
436,"Spoiler >!At its heart, this is an origin story about a fictional spy agency that blames WWI and 20 million deaths on an embittered Scottish cashmere farmer. But this mysterious man, who is seen only in shadows until a big reveal at the end, is played like an angrier and more sadistic but no less ridiculous Fat Bastard!< Honestly if you turn your brain off and get ready for a popcorn flick—which is what I expect from Kingsman—it was quite enjoyable. I kind of love it when movies set around a certain historical event go so stupidly out of left field.",0
437,I mean this movie blames the entirety of WWI (and to an extent WWII) on a Scottish farmer wanting revenge on England. I feel like that alone should tell everyone that this movie is meant to be taken lighter than the feather they keep throwing about.,0
438,"That being said, I agree with all the criticisms of this movie and would not recommend it to people lol",0
439,"Edit: oh and I really liked the Rasputin ballet-fighting scene. That kind of ridiculousness gave me the Kingsman-ness I wanted from the film. This was like watching someone's fever dream about World War 1 but they didn't quite know World War 1 history or thought it was boring and started filling in the gaps with random stuff. Rhys Ifans as Rasputin was the best part about this film. After he dies, it's all downhill from there. I have to say out of everything the fact they read out most of “Dulce et Decorum Est” made it worth seeing for me. I laughed super hard at the Hitler stinger. I’m a bit surprised by the people who are so put off by the writing choices. It’s an origin story of what the founder wrestled with what a Gentleman truly is. I thought the son’s plight in the middle of the movie was essential to the father overcoming his difficulty. I know it wasn’t identical to the Kingsman that came before but I really enjoyed the movie as a whole. ",0
440,"Only scene that didn’t do it for me was the the final formation of the society. Didn’t feel like they prepped for that moment enough. LMAO this review from the Washington Post: “Set against the backdrop of World War I and its origins, the film is essentially a trippier, more hallucinogenic version of an episode of “Drunk History” — one that might have been imagined (or dreamed) by a brainy but bored high-schooler who fell asleep during World History class after eating magic mushrooms” My mom gave it a 10/10",0
441,"We have watched some of the greatest movies of all time so I was happy I finally found a 10/10 for her. I'm so happy this is finally out so I can stop seeing the trailer before every movie I see. I get they wanted to promote it but at some point, show a different trailer. Who all was at the table at the formation of The Kingsman? While I don’t think the twist with Morton was that great, I will say the marketing and film did a great job at having me really believe that Aaron Taylor Johnson was the big bad, from having him in **zero** marketing, the big bad being hidden in shadows, and the voice in the trailers and in the movie until the reveal, sounding like ATJ doing a thick Scottish accent **plus** his actual character showing up and being Scottish. ",0
442,"Very early on it was clear Morton was a baddie, but wasn’t expecting him to be the actual main villain, so yea. ",0
443,"Anyways I enjoyed it for what it was. Rasputin was great and I thought all of the good guys were genuinely great. Loved Shola, Polly, and Orlando. No Man’s Land was brutal with that fight scene in the night being **wild** and I was not expecting Conrad to go out like that. Legit caught me by surprise. It was a very bizarre choice to go from Rasputin trying to give Voldemort a blow job to 1912. God I hope Kingsman 3 is as fun as the first one. Conrad getting shot in the head that way so suddenly was a very shocking moment. The son’s war adventure and death totally stunted the movie and served little purpose to the narrative. It derailed it from a fun action flick to this random conflict with little weight. The dad’s bummed for like 2 mins and then it tries to go back to the fun action romp tone.",0
444,"Just a weird choice in direction. I was really impressed by the no man's land scene. The setup of the knives only fight was interesting. But the aftermath of that where the kid breaks down after his first experience with actual fighting was surprising to see in a movie like this. The 5/10 are spot on. A lot of weird writing choices and general tone shifts make the film hard to really enjoy, but the saving grace remains spectacular actors (Charles Dance actually making me feel something like sadness for fucking Kitchener of all people, surprised even me) and fun action sequences. The Rasputin scenes were crazy and amazing and probably the most ""Kingsmen"" part of the entire film. The WWI stuff was pretty standard fare but the fight in No Man's Land was spectacular in its brutality. Just a lot of wasted potential in the story and setting. A Kingsmen film set in the 1920s with more weird gadgetry that actually showed us a budding ""spy agency"" with similar characters would have been more enjoyable than a lot of the plot dragassery of this.",0
445,"On the note of Conrad, I think a lot of people will dislike the character, which is fair, but I appreciate that his entire character is one giant trope destruction. The trope is that arrogant young rich English kid insists he is prepared for war (very common in actual England at the time), goes to war, and has the realization that actually all the old people were right and war is hell and he therefore becomes a much better man for it. The character is played straight to the trope right up until, well, war is hell, and he gets shot in the face by his own side after amazing heroics. Perfect. Excellent takedown of that. Sometimes there is no ""I am wiser now"" arc because the world doesn't work that way. Sometimes you just die in a stupid, pointless manner, which essentially encapsulates so much of WWI. All that said, not sure a wild action romp was really the place to deliver that message but here we are. Not quite what I would've expected for an ""origin story"" of how the Kingsman agency came to be. Not that I would've wanted a bunch of forced wink-wink, nudge-nudge references (the codenames covered that anyway.) ",0
446,"The tone and pacing was a bit all over the place with them trying to recreate this silly, fictionalized account of WWI. So much time is spent on exposition of how this country interacts with that country and this person's relationship with that person and how it ALSO affects the war. Don't get me wrong, in theory that stuff is all really interesting and I wouldn't mind watching a movie about it. But in Kingsman? It just felt a bit out of place and like they were trying to do too much all at once; something that would require a 3 hour epic to properly do it justice, not your standard silly action flick. That all said though, I respect them for trying something different, especially with the more unique time setting.",0
447,"My biggest disappointment was easily the villain, all that build-up for such a big letdown. Personally, I would've really preferred if Rasputin was the main baddie and that's kind of the vibe I got from the trailers buuuut I guess that's marketing for you. He was just so much more captivating and more of an interesting character as opposed to... angry Scottish man. Sure, they would've had to rewrite the story to make it work but it's not like they were going for 100% accuracy anyways. If anything I was expecting Ras to show up at the very end as a fun reference to how he supposedly didn't die even after being shot, stabbed, poisoned, etc.",0
448,"They've still yet to recapture the real charm of the original film, it's easily the strongest of the three. This one was still fun but I'm hoping they manage to raise the bar a little next time.",0
449,"I’m such a sucker for the whole “character explains plot and then there is a twist” trope so I was absolutely delighted by the format of this film. Pretty hilarious throughout too. Definitely recommend! I lost it when Coach held up four fingers at the end, with a facial expression like, ""come on man, that's four strikes"" LOL. Great lil movie, definitely worth watching in theaters. That Man From UNCLE poster near the end. Really enjoyed this movie.  Nothing groundbreaking, but it feels like it's been forever since Guy Ritchie has genuinely made a film like this that it kinda does serve aa a breath of fresh air.  ",0
450,"Also, probably the best performance I have seen from Charlie Hunnam yet.  SOA wasn't really for me & I can't say I've been impressed with him in any of his film roles up until now.   The scene in the apartment where they're trying to get the rich junkie girl to go home was enough to tell me I've been selling him short.",0
451,"Overall, I love the characters.  I love the tone.  I love the world.  I wouldn't *hate* a sequel I didn’t know I needed nearly two hours of Hugh Grant talking dirty to Charlie Hunnam in my life, but I did and now I’m complete. For a movie that was 45 minutes of setup, they really stuck the landing! Coach was high key the best character in this movie, dude just wanted to protect his students from gangster life and teach em how to fight properly. But still not afraid to get his hands dirty under the circumstances I’m a simple man, I see Colin Farrell in a movie, I enjoy it. This was super entertaining. Also haven’t seen much praise for Jeremy Strong, he was very funny, looking forward to seeing him in other roles I really enjoyed the film and great to see Ritchie back to doing what he does best. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY - does anyone know if those plaid tracksuits Farrell and his boys were wearing are a real brand, and where can I get one? ""You guys really need to invest in some parachutes"". Most directors would have just shown the movie, and let the plot roll, but Guy Ritchie having Fletcher and Ray talk to each other, and then we follow the end was genius, and made the movie funnier and ultimately more engaging. Colin Farrell is hilarious Whatever Mickey is paying Raymond, it isn't enough. That guy should be protecting heads of state. You couldn’t lift a wheel of cheese ya cunt Did anyone else spend the penultimate fifth of this movie expecting >!Raymond to have betrayed Mickey!<?",0

453,"Also, was it just me or did  Jeremy Strong  seem like nothing as much as a Wes Anderson character ended up in a Guy Ritchie movie somehow? [deleted] **There’s fuckery afoot.**",0
454,"Sums this movie up nicely. Sometimes when you see a joke in a trailer too many times it’s not as funny when you see the movie but the Phuc joke still got a big laugh. Colin Farrell has great comedic timing. This movie felt like it took forever to get going, but once it did it ended up really good. I hadn’t heard about this and I wasn’t expecting much.  This was a real pleasant surprise.  One of the most enjoyable and fun movies I’ve seen in awhile.  You had me at cunt. The parachute line was one of the funniest lines I've ever heard in a movie Thought the movie was honestly an extreme delight and thoroughly enjoyed the ride. I’m so glad for once that a sexual assault didn’t go through and ended on someone getting their comeuppance, and the satisfaction of seeing Dry Eye get a fitting end. And the whimper on his face when Mickey caught him, fantastic.",0
455,Not a perfect movie but an entertaining and engaging story for sure.,0
456,"Also Collin Farell stole every scene he was in, without a doubt. Hugh Grant is so good in this movie. I always felt like he wasted way too many years in Rom-Com Land when he’s always been a far more interesting actor than his looks imply. Here for the Hughnaissance. Stand out for me was Hugh Grant, for once he's not a blubbering posh fuck boy. Hunnams trouble with sticking to one accent persists.",0

Baby Moana meeting the sea has quickly become one of my favorite scenes of the year.  The chicken provided quality comedic relief without being overbearing. 10 piece chicken nuggets/10 Loved the quick Sven cameo when Maui couldn't get the hook to work  This movie was absolutely gorgeous. The scene when Moana finally sets off on her journey and her grandma's sprit is guiding her was the first time I realized that this was gonna be one special movie. That crab got fucking freaky when he went bio-luminescent.  I even saw a few kids in the theater a little unnerved at that. The coconut pirates was definitely a Mad Max reference right?  The whole movie was amazing, I loved when the Grandma comes back to guide Moana, definitely one of the highlights.   The animation as Tehiti(?) crawls to Moana floored me, as did all of the villians, especially Teca's fireballs and magma hands. Hei Hei and Maui's tattoo were great side characters as well. Am I the only one shocked to know that Auli'i Cravalho is only 16? I guessed early twenties but nope, sixteen! That's incredible. I hope she has a great career going forward. Loved her voice acting in this. My only complaint: not enough pig.  I'm gonna take a second to appreciate something I haven't seen mentioned: The sailing. Seriously, it's so well done. The terminology was all correct, they tied proper bowline knots, the way the boats moved and reacted to waves felt natural, and the movie gave the feeling of sailing: the wind in your hair, the feeling of the speed and how in tune you feel with your boat when your start going. It's been years that I haven't sailed and this movie brought on some serious nostalgia. Totally in love with this movie.  Disney is on a roll! Great characters, powerful girl main character who's not into a guy, the Rock was funny, LMM's awesome score, realistic depiction of Island culture, funny animal sidekick who's not overtly annoying, a pretty AWESOME ending for a disney animation.  This is my favorite Disney movie by far.  Will be taking my kids to see it again this weekend.  ",0
463,"Also like to point out - Moana is the MOST Princess-like character out of all disney princess movies.

And her line near the end: [""Let her come to me"", is the most royal, regal, majestic thing a Disney character has ever said.  She basically ordered the Ocean to part the sea like Moses, and then made an angry balrog-like villain crawl TO her so SHE can give her blessing to it and save the day.](#spoiler) WOW.  Now that's a REAL BAD ASS Royalty or GODDESS talking.   I love this movie.",0

470,"This movie made me SO proud to be a Pacific Islander.  What are people's thoughts on Zootopia vs. Moana? I think Zootopia's message was sharper, but Moana will be talked about longer thanks to soundtrack, broader appeal, and ultimately checking more of the classic Disney (and, Hero's Journey) boxes. I'm personally hoping Lin Manuel sticks around for something just a little more focused with Disney, but really seems Disney's on fire either way. ""I Am Moana"" had no business being as powerful a song/scene as it was. I seriously got chills watching it.   You shut the fuck up right now if you disagree that ""You're Welcome"" isn't the best song of 2016.  Disney can do no wrong at this point. They just print money Was getting some serious Bilbo Baggins / Smaug vibes from Moana and the shiny crab.",0
471,"""Sherlock, you're showing emotion!""",0
472,"Doyle Estate: WE GOT THEM. NOT A DRILL. SERVE THEM! Liked it. It was a fun film, nothing out of this world but really entertaining. Can see it being turned into a minor franchise. ",0
473,"My only pet peeve is that, in the Enola universe, despite being 1822, Holmes apparently doesn't have a Watson.",0
474,Edit: OK I got the year wrong. The intention remains correct. The money occurs cannonically after Holmes meets Watson in Study in Scarlet which was 1881. My wife and I enjoyed it. It’s not amazing but it’s a fun movie.,0
475,"It also was a like a mini Harry Potter reunion: Aunt Petunia, Bellatrix Lestrange and Madame Maxime [deleted] spoilers, but i liked that she faked drowning when the henchman was trying to kill her to get the upper hand. Feel like we don't see that move too often in movies. Very good except for the glossing-over of her mom being Victorian Guy Fawkes. I really enjoyed seeing Fiona Shaw. She nails   It to portray a character you hate. I absolutely loved it. I also loved that they got Helena Bonham Carter to play her mother. She was equally perfect for the role. Mycroft made me want to reach through and bitch slap him!! ",0
476,"I will most likely watch it again tonight. Great family movie, and the breaking the 4th wall bits were really well done and acted. ",0
477,"On a side note, Henry Cavill is an IMPOSING man. Built like a wall. Seeing Brown in a role that is energetic and charismatic is nice for a change. She is really going to be great if she can pick the right roles. ",0
478,"Cavill is fine, this does make me want a Sherlock movie with him at the lead though - we don't get him enough here.",0
479,"Fine family movie, or date night movie. nothing out of this world. Wait so was her mom a straight up domestic terrorist? I was so confused by that subplot.",0
480,Enjoyed the movie overall. Fun and endearing and very pretty to look at. Something light and entertaining given the seemingly chaotic times we live in.,0
481,"Had some headscratcher or half-hearted plot points (like how Sherlock deduced the Dowager was behind everything), but overall recommend. I was surprised how much I liked the movie.",0
482,Very cute family movie.,0
483,"Enola was a kick.  Intelligent, determined with a strong sense of perseverance.    As intelligent as she was, you could tell she was still not worldly.   She never gave a thought to the Landlady hoodwinking her for the money (convincing Enola her hole in the wall was decent lodging for London) or turning Enola in for the reward money.    I thought it was nice how she was going to open herself up to building a life at the end.  She seemed to stop using ""Enola is Alone spelled backwards"" as an anthem.   That she realizes, even though she's on her own doesn't mean she has to always be alone was a nice message.   Hope to see she and Sherlock eventually bond.",0
484,"Sherlock, I liked HC's interpretation of the character.  We rarely see him so gentile and I thought that made an interesting version.   It was easy to tell Sherlock's default setting is detached but that he wanted to connect to Enola and felt for her not knowing why their mother left without her.  He isn't use to being overly concerned with anyone other than himself but he was genuinely trying with Enola",0
485,"Mycroft was a little one-note but under his icey demeanor, I believe he cares about his siblings, while simultaneously being jealous of both.",0
486,Tewksbury was a nice counter to Enola.  He was more worldly/savy in some ways and proved to be resourceful in his own right.   By the end of the film I had no issue believing he would be so attached to Enola.,0
487,"GrandMother Tewksbury - I didn't see coming.   What a truly dark character hidden beneath a benign surface.   What she was willing to do to her own family just to keep the status quo was shockingly sinister, considering this is a kids movie.",0
488,"Eudoria Holmes - Mixed feelings about the kind of person she is.  I don't doubt she loves Enola, but she did abandon her, without explanation.  As intelligent and capable as her daughter is, she still has a lot to learn.",0
489,I hope they make a sequel. Anyone else hoped Tewkesbury would be wearing a corset when he got shot at the end?,0
490,"Bit disappointing that the only major mystery the audience had to work out was ""who wants to kill Tewkesbury?"" Which Enola has more or less told us about halfway through. Then you find out who did and its one random character whose been on screen about two minutes, with the only clue we get being ""it couldn't be the uncle"".",0
491,"Also, can I point out how ridiculous that plan was? You're gonna murder two members of your family just to get one vote in your favour in the House of Lords, which you somehow magically know will be decisive?",0
492,Maybe I'm overanalysing a kids' movie,0
493,"Also found it pretty corny how they made Mycroft such an over-the-top complete bellend, is he like that in original stories? God damn , why are men/boys on Reddit so afraid of women . [removed] Enjoyed it. Nothing to special but a fun film , definite sequel bait in the last 15 minutes with the potential Sherlock Enola team up and whatever her mother is involved in. Definitely interested in seeing this taken further Late to the party, watching it as we speak.",0
494,"I like it enough, and I'm enjoying Millie Brown's performance; glad to see she's more than just ""Eleven"". She's kinda funny and decently talented, looking forward to see what else she can do.",0
495,"I found the scene with Edith (the judo instructor) and Sherlock to be really jarring though. She was really offensive and venemous, laying into Sherlock / calling him names and telling him he's effectively a horrible person because he's not into politics...? Felt weird and almost shoehorned.",0
496,"The rest, I enjoyed. I didnt like that they made Mycroft a dumb guy. He's supposed to be as much of a genious as Sherlock, possibly more. ",0
497,"Here, hes just plain unlikeable i enjoyed the movie and hope they make a sequel.",0
498,few things i liked:,0
499,- the way they included scenes of the past as Enola is narrating/explaining something. it felt like it made sense in this movie and it was more natural than other movies ive seen it in.. plus i like the animated parts of it,0
500,- when Tewkesbury grandmother tells Enola she’s been given „a part of England“ to protect which ties really nicely with the (detective?) saying he works „for England“ right before he dies. think the actor delivered that line perfectly,0
501,- the fact that flowers are leads for Enola to find both her mom and Tewkesbury,0
502,"i loved the character of Tewkesbury but when i saw my mom reacting to his grandmother shooting him i kinda wish it the character had actually died because it would mean much more somehow? it was like the scene where Enola gets stabbed but not really I thought it was delightful. Enola is spunky, intelligent, charming, relatable, and overall someone who I would have looked up to as a kid. Thoughts:",0
503,\-Maybe I have too much faith in the modern audience but I cannot stand the amount of explanatory flashbacks they stuffed into this movie. It really takes the satisfaction out of a good aha-solved-the-clue moment when they flashback to a scene from 5 minutes ago.,0
504,"\-Tewkesbury was a refreshing boy love interest - the dude in distress, as it were. He takes on all the qualities of the stereotypical upper-class/princess love interest (pretty, polished, fussy, a love for softer things, cries). More boys like this on screen please.",0
505,"\- I suppose they're setting up for a sequel, but the ending was very abrupt and Enola's mom didn't really explain herself. We figured out what she was doing through Enola's investigation, but Eudoria herself doesn't actually admit anything at the end, nor do we see what her activist group ends up doing. And she never explains why she disappeared out of the blue instead of just telling her daughter that she had a project to go take care of. And then Enola is just cool with it? Felt weird. ",0
506,\--GOOD LORD I did not expect Linthorn (murderous henchman) to go out like that.,0
507,"Overall, this is a fun character I would like to see more of. Pretty disappointing and predictable for a mystery movie. All the clue-finding seemed incredibly generic, almost like a kids' show: anagrams, numbers that actually represent letters, more anagrams...",0
508,"The main character didn't even deduce that the grandma was the true mastermind; she just showed up in front of them. Also, how did she know they would return to the estate so that she'd know to send all the servants out?! Like, who the fuck would guess they'd make such a risky move instead of just hiding away in London again?",0
509,It was clearly using the Sherlock Holmes brand as a crutch. There is like nothing about this movie that required Sherlock Holmes be present. The story with the mother didn't even go anywhere.,0
510,"TLDR: The film was insultingly generic. This might get buried and overlooked, but...",0
511,"I can't believe the FOOKIN' LEGEND went out with a pinecone. Im actually quite interested in a sequel (with more Sherlock in action) This movie was pretty charming and would be great for children. MBB’s performance is charged with a mischievous energy which makes all the camera-winking fun instead of eye-rolling. I loved Enola’s arc; she strikes out to find her mother, to whom she was overly attached, but learns to be independent while also finding acceptance and validation from her brother and a new friend. ",0
512,My favorite moment was when she decided to put the search for her mother on hold to help out Tewksbury. She turns to the camera and contemplates aloud why she feels responsible for Tewksbury and says something to the effect of “My mother would tell me to forget about him; that he’s weak and foolish and none of my business. But he’s on the edge of a cliff without the strength to save himself and I **do ** have the strength.” It is an excellent message — I’d even call it Tolkien-esque.,0
513,Now for the bad: there was entirely too much jiu jitsu. Ideally there should have been no jiu jitsu in this movie. What makes Enola a good protagonist is resourcefulness. She should be using her mind to get out of jams. There should have been more moments like early when she jumped off the train just before it reached a bridge to strand her pursuer.,0
514,"The worst part of the movie was the climax of the Tewksbury story. It’s ridiculous and full of the worst cliches, including a character getting shot in the chest, lying on the ground knocked out seemingly dead, then regaining consciousness immediately after their friend discovers they were wearing bulletproof armor. Give me a break!",0
515,"Overall I liked this film quite a bit, but it could have been great with some rewrites to cut out the nonsense. I wish the mother and her reasoning for leaving had been more of the plot than the silly romance with the guy who’s clearly not even half as intelligent as enola. I got bored of his story very quickly. Decent movie tho, would have liked all of it except the predictable romance if I had seen it as a young woman as well.",0
516,"Timothee Chalamet’s “yo you game?!?” line to Leo’s wife got the biggest laugh out of me It was pretty obvious the Bash CEO was Bezos, Elon, Jobs, and a whole bunch of other greedy assholes rolled into one, but I think one less obvious parody they rolled into there was Marshall Applewhite, leader of the Heaven's Gate cult. Look and spoke EXACTLY like him, and their whole deal was escaping on a spacecraft as a comet passed the earth. I really enjoyed that little nod. ""It's just a different generation."" Just finished it on Netflix - when it comes to end of the world movies I appreciate in a depressing way movies that actually follow through with the destruction of the world instead of some last minute miracle Just saw it. Alternately funny/infuriating/depressing/beautiful. Definitely one of my favorite movies of the year. Walked out of the theater in a bit of a daze. Still processing it. Loved it. I really enjoyed this. To me Rylance was the MVP. There is something so deliberately off-putting about the way he plays Isherwell, it's honestly astonishing. I thought the movie handled it's messaging quite well. When dealing with a subject as maddening as the ways in which our power structures makes it so that cataclysmic events go completely unchallenged, I think completely throwing subtlety out the door was the right way to approach the story. I also think some of the criticism of the movie being unsubtle has to do with the way COVID played out. Yes, the media and politicians act exactly the same as during COVID. But the movie was written before. Kate’s obsession with General Themes taking their money for the free snacks was my favorite part of this film. Saw it today, thought it was pretty good, although I could have done without Ariana Grande and Kid Cudi’s characters, but her song was pretty good lol",1
517,"Really loved some of the performances (DiCaprio per usual) but the MVP’s were Perlman and Rylance for me. Both stole the show in their limited screen time Someone shouting ""I'm doing an 8 ball"" near the end cracked me up Deep Impact and Armageddon came out when I was a teenager.  I feel like ""Don't Look Up"" is the perfect satire for someone of my age.  I found myself laughing for the first half or so.  Then the laughter kind of turned into nervous laughter when it started to hit me that this story was so uncomfortably close to reality.  ",1
518,">!When the protagonists came up with the line, ""Just Look Up"", there was a small part of me that was rooting for the world to unite behind them.  But knowing the title of the movie, I knew there was no way it would work.  Also, the scene where Jennifer Lawrence goes to visit her parents was oddly reminiscent of how the relationship with my own family and my in-laws has evolved over time (don't worry, it's not THAT bad).  !<",1
519,"Really bummed I didn't stay for the end END credits scene.  I'll have to watch it again on Netflix. The performances really sell this movie I loved jonah hill and chalamet. Obviously the plot hits you over the head but its mostly a vehicle for laughs for me. I'm still laughing at how deep that general got under J. Law's skin with that water and snack move. I’m in the minority, but I loved this movie. Yes it’s over the top, but given how crazy the past few years have been, it makes sense. If I saw this in 2011 I would’ve thought it was unrealistic, but 2021 is sadly a different story I absolutely loved this film but understand why it would rub some viewers the wrong way. Yes, it has the subtly of a comet impact but god damn if it isn’t an enjoyable and memorable ride.",1
520,I’m a huge fan of McKay’s kinetic filmmaking style and the script strikes a perfect balance between darkly hilarious and outright depressing. I don’t think I’ve flipped flopped between laughter and existential dread this much since Bojack Horseman.,1
521,"Performance-wise, Mark Rylance is the real unsung hero here. His off-kilter performance steals every scene he’s in.",1
522,"In short, this is clear case of Adam McKay doing Adam McKay, will all the highs and lows you’d expect. If you liked Vice and The Big Short, you’ll likely like this. If you thought those were too preachy, don’t expect otherwise here. The repeated editing trick of ending scenes in the middle of sentences made me laugh every time Cate blanched is sexy as hell SPOILER:",1
523,"Let's all talk about the fact that Leo has added another ""death"" to his movie credentials. ",1
524,"anyways, fav part was Jonah saying ""Fine you wanna come"" and then slamming the door. Rofl > Overall, great movie and unfortunately I feel like it’s not far off from what might happen if a similar situation occurred in 2022. Seriously",1
525,"When I first learned of the premise of the film, I thought to myself, “oh, that is going to be about COVID. The last two years have been terrible, I don’t want to watch a movie about how terrible the last two years have been.”",1
526,But then ended up seeing it anyway.. and I was very wrong.,1
527,The film is not about COVID. It’s not about what *could* happen.,1
528,"This film is about what *is* happening, right now, with climate change.",1
529,"Climate change is a giant comet hurdling towards earth. There are scientists trying to break through the din. But it’s not working and we’re all going to die :( You can see Meryl Streep almost break character and laugh a couple times when Jonah Hill is talking, especially because I think he was ad libbing. At the political rally she looks down because it seems like she’s trying not to laugh So we all gonna ignore that Matthew Perry didn’t make the final cut ? Another random comment I have after digesting the movie for a day: holy shit Timothee Chalamet is hilarious and they need to cast him in more comedies ""Your dad and I are for the jobs the comet will create."" Man can we talk about that last scene? The way everyone is trying to have a mundane conversation to take their mind off things but there's just this hint of panic under their faces. Just brilliant acting. And the freeze frames on their faces trying to hold it together as the world around them begins to crumble, full on exploding in JLaw's case. Excellent directing and editing.",1
530,I thought the movie overall was ok but that ending was phenomenal. [removed],1
531,"The fucking baby hand got me How did a place like you end up in a girl like this?  *You think Ryan Reynolds succeeded because of his acting skills?* Deadpool fracturing his two hands and leg trying to bring down Colossus brought me to tears.  Favorite Line: ""That guy over there wants to talk to you, it might advance the plot."" One of my favourite little moments of the film is when he's just received the news about his cancer, and he's just silently staring at Vanessa, tears welling up in his eyes, memorizing her face.",0
532,"Really captured that bit of the Deadpool character nicely. When he loves someone, he just devotes his entire life to them. Only two people in x-men mansion, couldn't stop laughing.",0
533,"Then the Hugh Jackman/Wolverine references were priceless. In the sequel we need to see him go on the haunted segway tour  Saw this last night. Was great, loved it.",0
534,"What was odd was the number of little kids going to see it. I don't mean like teens in a ""I'm getting older and think all younger people are kids"", I'm talking 5-10 year old range of kids.",0
535,"There is literally a scene where Wade gets fucked in the ass by a woman wearing a strapon.  ""I'd go with you, but I don't want to."" ""I had a nightmare about Liam Neeson, I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter."" One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and I absolutely loved it.  He shoots Ajax in the face and makes Colossus double over and vomit.",0
536,"Jesus christ, that movie was hilarious. I knew Stan Lee would have the cameo, but a part of me really wished it was Hugh Jackman, especially with the references to him in the beginning.",0
537,"That was the best Stan Lee cameo I've seen in a Marvel movie thus far though. [deleted] Captain deadpool I love how casually they just name dropped Cable in the post-credits scene. Fucking Cable and Deadpool man. *Look away, child.*",0

544,[Click here to go to international thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/78ivjl/official_discussion_thor_rangarok_international/) Was that the most Jeff Goldblum-y performance we've seen from Jeff Goldblum yet? ,0

What an awesome movie. ",0

""...but giant monster"" Hela was killing off The Warriors Three like they were Generation 1 Autobots.  Surprise Matt Damon is starting to become a thing. I’m impressed Marvel held all the Korg stuff back in marketing, easily the funniest character in the MCU by a mile.",0
555,"Waititi should VO more animated characters, his line delivery had even me laughing like a maniac OK, who here thinks Loki has the Tesseract now? Hands? Goldblum went full Goldblum and I loved every single line.",0
556,"""Call it a tie!"" Thors story about Loki trying to kill him as a child was amazing. Felt like I was there with them.  It's easy to gloss over but I loved the Willy Wonka homage in the rainbow exposition tunnel. I like how Jeff Goldblum just seemed to be cast as Jeff Goldblum ruling a planet.  He had me in stitches, especially with the Birthday scene. Banner jumping out of the commodore and splattering on the ground had me crying in laughter  I need to see Dr Strange do an Old Spice Commercial.  I can't believe they got The Matthew Damon from We Bought a Zoo This was a fucking blast. Quite possibly the funniest Marvel movie yet. Chris Hemsworth really got to use his considerable comic chops to great use in this film. I can’t wait to see it again. ",0
557,"Also, Jeff Goldblum was awesome. ""Piss off, Ghost!"" Who else forgot [Doctor Strange](#spoiler) was going to be in it? I did and it was super fun and surprising and awesome",0
558,"For a Ryan Reynolds produced movie a lot of characters sure were open about how hot a character looking exactly like Ryan Reynolds is. The scene where she tells him to turn around and he's just like ""okay!"" And does a little spin with a stupid smile on his face had me rolling.",0
559,"This was such a happy movie! Cheesy as hell and everything I expected it to be. I'm a sucker for Ryan Reynolds. Hey Keys, maybe be a bro and program a Millie into the game so Guy isn’t hanging around “unable to find love” forever Evans got the biggest reaction, but when Tatum first appeared at the beginning of the movie, the people beside me were debating if it was him or not. They lost it when it became pretty clear it was him. Still doesn’t beat his cameo in This Is The End though. I loved DUDE's unfinished nature. The T-shirt icon on his pectorals, his 'catchphrase', and the fact that Antwan convinced the Art nerds to just throw on a gold chain before anything else. Hilarious. Tired: “They referenced Marvel, Star Wars, Valve games, Mega Man, and Fortnite!”",0
560,"Wired: “They referenced the [greatest movie scene](https://youtu.be/mikj8eDKxMQ) of all time.” Catchphrase! I loved the background stuff, there was one scene were a background player kept jumping into a wall and lagging around the place which I thought was so spot on. I even didn't mind the cameos from streamers/YouTubers either, I thought it was a real nice touch to include them. Was the guy Mills gets the info from then kills Hugh Jackman?? Ted Lasso and Free Guy being two successes during the pandemic really makes you think. ",0
561,Maybe the American people just want something wholesome and fun with the rough 18 months we’ve been through. ,0
562,"I’m all for it You can see the exact moment Disney and Fox merged in this movie The Chris Evans cameo made me laugh Taika Waititi being in both The Suicide Squad (although more of a cameo) and Free Guy in consecutive weeks and both being great films. The Alex Trebek Cameo actually made me a bit sad I was not expecting that OFFICER JOHNNY!!!! I liked that Guy wasn’t the only NPC who was evolving. The barista and the bombshell companion character both had their own growth. Well that was about as god damn wholesome as it gets. As an immigrant in New Zealand, this movie definitely hit the ""kiwi cinema goers go wild for Taika Waititi showing up in a film"" that I've come to expect.",0
563,"I really enjoyed it. It's a fun movie, with lots of homages to other movies, and a genuinely interesting story. Is it the best movie in the world? No. Does it need to be? No. I liked it more than I expected to, to be honest.",0
564,"One of my favourite things about it was the friendship between Guy and Buddy. They could easily have had Buddy just stay as an irrelevant NPC that Guy outgrows when he realises he's an AI - but those guys genuinely really care for each other and Buddy is always there for him in ways I didn't see coming. I loved that at the end, the friendship between Guy and Buddy was given as much weight as (if not more than) >!the romance between Millie and Keys.!< There were quite a lot of kids in my screening, all of which reacted with laughs and such when the likes of jacksepticeye, DanTDM and Pokimane showed up. I thought it was cute.",0
565,"Overall, it was a fun movie. Better than I was expecting it to be, honestly. The true hero of this movie is RTX reflections. Every time I saw what ""Free City"" looks like in real life it reminds me of those shitty mobile game ads that look/are nothing like the actual game. This is pretty much the best Saints Row movie or Grand Theft Auto movie ever made. “What the shit?!” Might be bold to say, but I think this is the best movie of the summer. A completely original film beating out a Marvel, DC, and F&F movie is no easy feat. Now we now those  shades in the matrix weren't just silly cosmetics",0
566,Emma Stone did a great job making me go from sympathetic to hating her “Are you here to seduce me or rape me?”,1
567,“I’m a gentleman”,1
568,“Rape it is”,1
569,"The theater CACKLED This is definitely one of those movies where I left the theater not feeling anything, but the more I think about it the more I loved it. Reading these comments has also put a lot of things in perspective. Each of the three characters were incredibly well-written and defined, with clear motivations. You start out rooting for Abigail but she turns into the very thing that made Sarah unappealing in the first half of the movie. And in the end, all three of them end far worse than when they started (personally, not financially).",1
570,"* **Anne** - All she wants is something real. All 17 of her children died and she uses her pet rabbits to fill that void. It's also demonstrated when she's wailing throughout the halls and picks up the baby just to hold for a little. She thinks she found true friendship with Abigail, but she had it with Sarah all along. But by the time she realizes it, it's too late and the damage has been done. She ends up alone, with nothing but her pets (Abigail) to keep her company.",1
571,"* **Sarah** - She claims to love Anne and her country, but loses both in the end. She was conniving and calculating, but like she said, she was playing a different game than Abigail. Her game was politics. Keep the war going, keep her husband and her relevant, and wield power behind the scenes. She manipulated Anne just as Abigail did, but with different goals in mind. I believe she did love Anne in her own way. Love is telling you you look like a badger, not lying that the whole court is always saying how nice your hair is.",1
572,"* **Abigail** - Fell on hard times and was essentially a prostitute to try and survive. All she wants is to reclaim the good life and will do anything to get there. At first we're meant to root for Abigail, but in retrospect the red flags were there all along. How many times did she lie to get into places she wasn't supposed to be? We chalk it up as being clever or charming, but she's manipulating everyone. While Sarah is playing the political game, she's playing the social one. And once she gets power, she becomes exactly the same as the people we're meant to see as ridiculous in the beginning - drunken behavior, openly cheating and using her husband, squeezing the rabbit. And in the final scene she realizes that despite all of the nice things, she's still essentially a prostitute, there to be used as needed for whatever the queen desires.",1
573,"**TL;DR** - All three characters are miserable in the end. I related to the queen on a spiritual level when she continually ate blue cake while crying and vomiting.  It's a testament to the film's quality that the slow-motion scene where powdered aristocrats throw melons at a giggling, naked fat-man *isn't* the most talked about part. Aside from the obviously great main cast, I really enjoyed Nicolas Hoult in this. His comedic timing was on point. Loved the scene when Abigail pretends to cry and he just rolls his eyes and says something like ""alright you can stop that now, have a good night"" Horacio The Fastest Duck In The City BETTER get a Best Oscar nomination or The Academy is officially ran by cowards  Can't believe more people aren't talking about that hysterical dance scene. You know that super shocked expression Abigail had on her face during the scene where she watches in secret as the queen and Sarah started having sex? ",1
574,"Yeah that was the expression of my entire mostly elderly audience during that scene. They were not prepared. ""I like it when she puts her tongue in me"" is got to be one of this year's most memorable lines Love these trashy bitches I gotta say I laughed every single time Olivia Coleman shouted/screamed. Man I hope she somehow wins Best Actress. The cinematography in this film is amazing. Simultaneously classically beautiful, like something from Barry Lyndon, but also offbeat and bizarre (i.e. fisheye lenses). The modernity of dialogue and camerawork perfectly breaks down that rigid facade we’ve come to expect from period pieces like this and the end result is hilarious. Yorgos is the man. Never has a tension-breaking *quack* been so hilarious.",1
575,"Colman deserves all the awards. Oscar, BAFTA, Spirit, Pulitzer, Nobel, Fastest 100m Dash, everything. Two different groups got up and left from my small, but almost full theater this evening. This movie is obviously not everyone's cup of tea.",1
576,"Also, Rachel Weiss in her shooting coat was the most visually pleasing costuming I think I've ever seen. She's beautiful, but that coat and hat with the from-the-floor filming angle was the definition of eye-candy for me. So I guess Yorgos’ trademark is officially “uncomfortable sex scenes”  Oh one more thing to add. No one I've talked to noticed this but listen closely to the Fox Searchlight Logo. It's the 20th Century Fox fanfare done entirely with animal sounds! It's super subtle but it's definitely there.  That doorman to Anne’s room definitely knew *everything* The three main leads are amazing, and deserve as much recognition as they can get for this movie. The thing that amused me at the end of the movie, is that the person who gained the most by the end was the Dandy politician guy, who got everything he wanted with no consequences to him. Everyone else arguably is in a worse position than in the beginning, including Emma Stone's character who went from low class prostitute to personal prostitute to the Queen (more or less). Also, Emma Stone squashing the bunny felt like such a betrayal. I knew she wasn't a great person, but holy shit.  I'd reccomend this one to anyone, even to people who weren't fans of Lanthimos' other films. All three of the lead characters are fascinating fully realized monsters, and watching the drama escalate between them was a joy. Well I didn’t expect a film about 18th-century British royalty to use the word “cunt” as much as it did. The terms **“va-ju-ju”** and **“cuntstruck”** will definitely be ones I’ll remember for a good while. If I could describe the movie in one word, I’d say it’d have to be “unhinged,” as it seems that all three leading ladies were at their wit’s end by the end of the film’s runtime. ",1
577,"Colman’s portrayal of a queen who is falling apart mentally and physically throughout was pretty interesting to see. She has her moments of humor while also having moments where we learn more about her past and her reign. Stone and Rachel Weistz pull off a pretty believable rivalry throughout, each trying to one up the other for the queen’s affections for their own reasons. I do think that Nicolas Hoult’s character stole the show in just about all of his scenes, show a bit of a detachment of a person with so much wealth and power, all the absurdities are the normalcy. ",1
578,"The vulgar (yet sharply written) dialogue was a good contrast to the gorgeous views of the British palaces and all of the period attire. At time it really reminded me to 2006's Marie Antoinette, but without the rock music. ",1
579,"On an off topic note, I couldn’t help but notice that on the schedule for upcoming discussion threads that “Vox Lux” isn’t on the list yet. Is there plans of the film having a discussion thread in the future? At least in my local theaters, it has already started show in some theaters.  This movie was excellent, but I'm surprised how restrained it was. I expected Yorgos to get weirder, but the film really keeps itself composed.",1
580,The dance seen cracked me up. It was the perfect amount of ridiculous without going too over the top. ,1
581, I LOVED the dance scene. Seemed to slowly spiral into something uncanny and out of its time. Such a great film.  That was the classiest episode of Jerry Springer I ever saw. Two cousins fighting over a fat crazy white lady. Classic Springer.,1
582,"I am absolutely in love with this film, and I've been desperately looking for someone to talk about it with! It only came out on Friday and I've seen it twice already. I can't remember the last time I've seen a film that's stuck in my head so vividly, I keep replaying it in my head and can hear the haunting notes of the piano music that plays at one point in the film (I forget which) and the silent looks and exchanges they share throughout. I thought the relationship portrayed was so realistic, awkward, raw, intimate and beautiful overall - I'll never forget how much I was smiling when [they both got back together and Gheorghe returns with him to the farm. It's such a refreshing change from the downbeat endings that seem quite common in LGBT films](#spoiler). Such a great satisfying arc all round.",0
583,"I went to a Q&A in Clapham on Saturday and it was great to hear insight from the director and cast - they obviously went on a real journey with this film and it really came from the heart, and it shows! I got to talk to Alec Secareanu who plays Gheorghe after the film finished, and he was such a nice cool guy and very humble. ",0
584,"Overall, this film has resonated with me on a lot of levels and I was totally sideswiped by it. Best British film of the year bar none.",0
585, Oh wow I'm so glad to see someone respond!!! I too was blown away. I originally thought it was a 4/5 but it's really stayed with me. More so than any film I've seen recently.,0
586,"I'm so envious of the Q and A, there was one in my end of the country but i didn't go. Also incredibly envious of you meeting Secareanu. He was so distractingly handsome. ",0
587,What was your favourite scene? Mine was the pasta scene. So subtle but romantic.  just finished seeing it!,0
588,finally we get a gay movie that ends well without any deaths or tearful separations.,0
589,"one thing that striked me as odd is that everyone is okay with john being gay? like...the dad is supportive, the nan just flushes condoms down the toilet, the girl friend introduces him to her gay friend from college.",0
590,"in a word, i liked the movie. i want that true love shit and all that hoopla. i want someone like george to hold me and stare at me like he does. swoons... I know right! It's so rare that a film stays with me these days like this one did - and when it happens it's a real magical feeling! ",0
591,"I was quite intimated approaching Secareanu, I was heading out of the cinema and saw he was having a cigarette and I just sucked up the courage and went for it! So glad I did. And he's just as handsome in real life believe me. I've got a bit of a crush I think haha!",0
592,"I loved the pasta scene. It's one hand got an undertone of sadness [as Johnny thinks over his dad,](#spoiler) and then Gheorghe edges in and you can just feel the warmth shining in. It's moving, funny and adorable. ",0
593,"I loved the scene where Johnny tries to hint at his mum to leave them be and stop the ironing, it got a lot of laughs in my audience. And it's just so sweet how Johnny nestles up to Gheorghe when she leaves - the way the two interact there just felt so honest and real. ",0
594,"I also keep thinking of the scene when Gheorghe walks off toward the edge of the hill and Johnny wonders where he's going - and then when he gets there the two look over the absolutely gorgeous landscape before them. And you just see that look on Johnny's face - the first time he seems to really appreciate and take in the beauty of his surroundings - and Gheorghe just looks and smiles at him knowingly. It's a great beat and the music works gorgeously without being overly sentimental - it's really earned and true arc moment for Johnny, he's finally beginning to open up and see his 'own country' so to speak. ",0
595,"  The director specifically stated in an interview, that he didn’t depict homophobia in the movie because he didn’t experience any while growing up in the same area. This movie is semi-autobiographical and he states that no one really cared. Personally, I find it refreshing because not all of us have horrible lives filled with discrimination. My family was 100% accepting when I came out and it was never an issue, thankfully. Of course many others have suffered immensely, but everyone’s story is different. I think as the LGBT community gains more acceptance, films depicting our lives will evolve to reflect that. ",0
596,"Btw, the director still lives in the English countryside and the actors actually stayed at his house.  I was surprised to see Johnny suddenly seem so affectionate with Gheorghe post-nan leaving. This was something I initially thought was too quick but then in hindsight johnny was so starved off affection he probably then couldn't get enough. I like when he's kind of sulking in the caravan before Gheorghe kisses him and the tentative scene in the bath where he suggests he might stay longer :). The ending was really hopeful. Woman in front of me was blubbering. ",0
597,"Well done you for having the guts to speak to him!!  thanks for the info. very heartwarming. i wish this mentality can spread throughout the whole world. seeing the movie made me crave a partner. i hope you have someone special who loves you. That's what I took away from it, he was jumping at the chance of affection and excited to have that freedom. It was one of those nice moments you get to see him emerge of his shell a bit. Yeah, I loved how hopeful it was, we really need this kind of film right now! ",0
598,"And thanks, definitely a highlight of my year haha! You’re very welcome. I don’t have anyone in my life who loves me other than friends and family. That’s enough, until a movie like this comes along and suddenly you feel a void in your heart. The people who’ve found their one are very lucky indeed.  can you dish on Secareanu? how does he smell? is he gay irl? tell me about him!",0
599,also re: johnny wanting more affection. but he had multiple chances with the guys he fucked around with. but he dismissed them all beforehand. i never understand guys like this who are permanently starved for emotional connection but just push away every nice guy that comes their way.,0
600,"I cooka da pizza Did anyone else feel it ended kind of abruptly/weirdly? The jump from the murder to the trial was a bit much I thought it was cartoonish, but fun. They should have called it *A Gucci Movie*. Maurizio smiled his way through the first two hours... LG and Pacino are easy noms for their categories",0
601,Leto… that’s a bit much pal. Thought he was gonna look to the camera and ask where da freakin’ gabagool was at one point What did everyone think of the accents?,0
602,I remember Salma Hayek talking about how she worked with a dialect coach who thought Lady Gaga sounded Russian. The irony to me is Salma Hayek sounded like… Salma Hayek. Laughed out loud at the cut when Leto is about to scream and we just hear his car horn instead. Between that and the sudden cut to Jeremy Irons dead in a casket the editor was clearly having fun just wilding out.,0
603,"For most of the movie I was wondering why we were sitting through so many scenes with this ridiculous tarot card reader, then she ends up becoming a pivotal part of the plot. Kinda wish Scott cut a few of her scenes, though, this really didn't need to be 157 mins long. After seeing Leto's performance in this, it's clear the role of Mario in the Mario movie was miscast. So did Dominico steal Gucci from the family? It seems thats what the filmmakers want us to think. He seems to be the reason the father never signed the cert. he knew about the forgery. He took over the company No browns, no pastels. Is it possible for an actor to win an Oscar and a Razzie for the same role? Because I think that might apply for Leto here. I wish we got the movie the trailers promised. I enjoyed it, don't get me wrong, but the trailers promised more of a family takeover struggle/drama but instead it mostly glossed over and skipped between different events very quickly. It was more of...I guess a long sequence of short scenes. Good performances all around, interesting story (I wasn’t familiar with any Gucci history going into it), but definitely didn’t need a nearly 2 hour 40 minute runtime. Overall I enjoyed it. I bet it will do well at the box office. Anyone who liked this should watch All the Money in the World which has a lot of similarities including the same director. I enjoyed it, but there were a few parts I didn’t understand and I was wondering if anyone might be able to help me. ",0
604," 1. What was the significance of the man watching Adam Driver’s character in the very beginning of the movie? We see a man watching him from a car, and also from the riverbank when he’s on the boat. Who was that guy? ",0
605,"2. I was confused about the unsigned will. Did Jeremy Irons’ character leave it unsigned on purpose, or was there some manipulation at play? And then later on, was this the same document that turned up with the forged signature? If so, the movie never explained who forged the signature right? Are we supposed to think Lady Gaga’s character did it? ",0
606,"3. Why did the police raid Adam Driver’s house? I thought there were no more tax crimes to account for after Al Pacino got arrested? It seemed like Adam escaped to Switzerland to evade arrest, but later he returned and everything was fine, it seemed like nothing came of the police raid. The acting is what kept me watching for sure. I thought the story was kinda meh, and honestly a little boring, and they could have done the first hour in twenty minutes. However, the actors were all so on point that I couldn’t stop watching it. I think Leto the man is a piece of shit, but Leto the actor was tragically hilarious and very well performed. And Pacino, man was it nice to see subtle nuanced Pacino again, like The Godfather days. Driver was good, Gaga made me sick (in a good way). But ya, forgettable Oscar bait somewhat saved by fantastic performances. I have to be honest, when Marizio skied down the hill and saw Paola for the first time, I honestly thought it was Paolo wearing a fake nose and was extremely caught off guard to her being the new love interest. Best part was when Patrizia shows up at Maurizio's house, begging for him to come home. It was a heartbreaking scene but I felt both actors sold it very well. I wish they would have made it more obvious the passage of time, and what years/dates were happening when. For example, we see Aldo celebrating his 70th birthday, then two scenes later he’s celebrating it again, is that the following year? Hard to tell.",0
607,"Honestly there was a missed opportunity with the use of music - I wish they would have used songs that were reflective of the actual year a scene is taking place in, instead of whatever random pop songs they chose.",0
608,"I also ultimately don’t think Maurizio was anything more than a hen-pecked husband. Patrizia never had any real power or even fame or public devotion, she was just kind of - there. It seems like in the real life Gucci story, the family would have screwed up their business with or without her involvement. The real point of interest is the murder, which they spent very little time on.",0
609,"Overall though the movie was entertaining, and everyone put out a great performance. I don’t think it will sweep Oscar gold, but there will probably be some nominations. Lady GaGa gives a convincing look at the depravity of the rich and famous. Scorsese should have directed this movie I really enjoyed this movie. Jared Leto's performance will be very polarizing, but I ate that shit up. My one big complaint is that they didn't show as much of the business side of Gucci as I was yearning for.",0
610,"But its just a really entertaining movie. Definitely recommend seeing it. Going into this movie blind and then leaving the theater to find out Jared Leto played Paolo is a level of shock I’m not sure I’ll ever experience again I respect Ridley Scott for making the films he wants to make and it seems based off of this year’s sample size that he wants to make films where Adam Driver ***fucks*** I was getting serious Borat vibes from Paolo during the film. “He has my peaches in a very tight greep,” I mean this would sound right at home in a Borat movie. Watched this tonight and loved it. But I'm gonna need some external opinions to help clear up a discussion with my girlfriend.",0
611,We can't fully agree on the relationship between Maurizio and Patrizia. We do agree that Patrizia began as a gold digger (Points to her reaction to his name and then stalking him) but we then have varying opinions. ,0
612,Did she really fall in love with him? (Points to marrying him despite him having nothing at the time and them being happy without wealth) ,0
613,Or did she always see the potential for power and money and she trusted it would come back? (Points to the scenes with Pina and her kickstarting him going back to the Gucci family),0
614,"At the end, when she's at his house because of the divorce, was she crying and so on because she loved him or was it because she lost the power and wealth?",0
615,"PS: Either way, despite her being the ""villain"", I did feel bad for her. What an amazing performance.",0
616,"Theres a thread that pops up here every once in a while about what people think is the best acting in one scene in a movie. Sally Hawkins in the scene where she's begging Giles for his help to rescue the Asset. Where she's telling him to say what she signs. God damn so good.  I want a del toro bioshock movie so bad that it hurts  [deleted] I seriously didn't think I would like Giles that much. I adore the close relationship he has with Elisa, and I really want to know how they first met. Man, did I cringe (in a good way) during that scene when he was talking to the pie guy. I felt *so* bad for him. ",1
617,"I admit that I did like the little scene where Elisa basically tells Zelda that she had sex with the fish man because they could have easily gone to "" Oh god you had sex with him?! Eww! I can't look at you anymore"" angle. Instead, they basically had Zelda react as if  it wasn't *that* big of a deal, save for the whole "" Does he have a dick?"" part. Plus Zelda basically laughs like ""Wow Elisa I can't believe you had sex with him! You just went for it, huh? "". Weird for me to put into words, but it was nice that Zelda wasn't grossed out at Elisa? It just felt like a casual conversation between good friends.",1
618,"I think one of my favorite scenes was at the end where Asset revives and stares down Strickland before killing him. Not because of Strickland getting killed, but because the Asset really looked ""like a god"", and it really felt like a ""You kidnapped me, tortured me, tried to kill me, and you killed *her*. How dare you."" vibe with his body language. Also props for the movie not making the Asset come back to life like it was a huge dramatic moment. IIRC, there was no music playing, and it was a nice touch to me. ",1
619,"Not gonna lie, I stared at Strickland's hand each time it was on screen, and I did like how the fingers slowly changed colors over time due to it rotting. That said, I am kinda surprised that it didn't seem to affect his health with how black those fingers were near the end. I could have missed something, though. There were two I really loved about this film.",1
620,1. That poem at the end. So gorgeous.,1
621,"2. There’s a moment that would usually be your typical passionate Oscar award speech when Elisa is telling Giles how desperate she is to save Fish Man, but that passion is only seen physically in her body, and on her face, due to Giles simply translating her movements sans passion. That was so intriguing to me. You were speaking Russian BOB! Oh my god that was incredible.",1
622,"So what do y'all think? Was she a fish person originally, or did he just give her gills? “Can I offer you a nice egg in this trying time?” WHY DID HE HAVE TO EAT THAT POOR KITTY SOMEBODY NEEDS TO TELL THAT BITCH YOLANDA TO BE COOL I could listen to Octavia Spencer rant about Bruce all day. Fuckin Bruce.",1
623,"Also I love this movie  I loved the scene where the monster escaped from the apartment and Elisa finds him alone in the cinema.   He was transfixed on the film playing,  which I believe was The Ten Commandments as there were slaves working on what appeared to be Egyptian monuments.  It struck me pretty powerfully because Elisa is this monster's Moses, breaking his chains,  hiding him from villainy,  and ultimately just trying to free him.   Wow.",1
624,"Cold era fairy tale. The music was incredible and I loved the main theme over the opening water sequence. Loved the ASL. Loved the whole movie musical moment. Also, props to that door manufacturer for making such a water tight seal.  I'm really glad that Del Toro didn't go down the path where Elisa's voice gets magically cured- her character was just so perfect and although I was delighted by the solo song and dance sequence, I was worried that he'd undermine his own message by ""fixing"" her. And then I remembered it's Del Toro and I was just glad he gave us at least not horribly depressing ending! ""Sometimes I think I was born too early or too late for my life"" is one of the best lines of the film. Born too late to be an artist, too early to be accepted as gay. The editing on this movie was SO VELVETY SMOOTH. It was like butter. ",1
625,"Sally Hawkins, have your Oscar nomination now (though I'm worried Meryl Streep is going to play spoiler to Sally & Frances McDormand's competition).",1
626,The Strickland peeing scene is maybe my favorite scene of the entire movie. Best laugh I had all year.,1
627,"I really wanted to see the fishman's penis tho. *Disappointed* I'd like to talk about the ending. I personally believe that the ending may not be the ""true"" events (I am aware that this is a work of fiction) but are just Giles' mind fantasizing that they ""lived happily ever after"". This of course is a trick del Toro pulled in Pan's Labyrinth when [Ofelia sees her parents and the faun welcoming her back into the fantasy land but with the implication being that this may be just her seeing what she wants to see in her dying moments.](#spoiler)",1
628,"I also found it interesting how just about everyone character in the movie has difficulty communicating with someone they're close to (Zelda can't emotionally connect with her husband, Giles can't communicate with the Pie guy, Strickland outright refuses to communicate with his wife), but Elisa and Sexually Thrilling Undersea Dude (S.T.U.D.) are able to communicate better than anyone else despite both lacking the ability to speak. I just thought that was interesting. Giles is just such a delightful character: erudite, slightly crass, so genuine. I loved his excitement at concocting a plan with Elisa, felt such heartbreak for him with his failures in his love life, and such joy when he got his hair back. He was really the perfect supporting player. ",1
629,"Great film, loved it even though I had a few issues with the third act (it seems weird that Hoffstetler would give Elisa and Zelda up if he knew he was going to die no matter what), and some of the writing was a bit on the nose. Did anyone notice she lived above the Orpheum movie theater? A callback to the poet from Greek mythology, Orpheus, as well as the fact that she was an orphan. I really appreciated the name",1
630,"E Probably goes without saying but...Michael Shannon is so so good in this. The bit at Zelda's house where he rips off his infected fingers is something that will stick with me for a while. I don’t care what anyone says, Abraham Sapien is definitely Elisa and fishman’s child.  Loved the movie. Doug Jones was wonderful as sexy fish man My absolute favorite thing about this movie was just how freaking gorgeous the color palette was. Specifically a lot of emphasis being placed on the color green, so I just wanted to ask you guys; what did you think the color green actually meant in the context of the movie? In addition to being probably the most prominent color, there are even a few lines about it directly in the movie. So what did you guys think about that? my girlfriend pointed out that toilet water would have merged with the water they were swimming in in that bathroom scene",1
631," The movie made a woman and fish man fucking cool, so it gets a thumbs up from me.",1
632,Incredible movie.,0
633,"Also Buzz Aldrin is one stone cold, cool motherfucker.  88 bpm heart rate at launch. That first shot of the crawler, crystal clear and stretching all the way across the IMAX screen really felt like a mission statement for the rest of the film.  [deleted] I saw this with a Q&A by the director in New York last week and some behind the scenes fun facts",0
634,- They were not originally going to use the 65mm film until someone from the national archives contacted them that they found it. ,0
635,- The government shutdowns last year impacted some of the scanning and digitization of the film - as in vehicles stuck between DC and New York. ,0
636,- Once they were done scanning they made proper backups of hte scans and moved them out of the city on multiple hard drives,0
637,- There exists a 9 day edit of the film where all the raw footage was laid out on a timeline. ,0
638,"- The film recorded did not have audio synced to it, so someone had to go in and manually lip sync the comms with Mission control to the footage.  I liked how they teased the Apollo mission cinematic universe with Jim Lovell’s cameo [deleted] I just got out of it and it was spectacular. This film shows how important good editing is. A complete narrative was given without a single piece of narration being heard. This and First Man would make for a great double feature. ",0
639,"Kinda perplexed by the people in my theater who left after they landed on the moon. The return to Earth was one of the most joyous moments of the film.  I saw this last week in IMAX, this was great.  I was surprised at the sheer variety of footage and angles and sources they were able to get video from, from (obviously) official NASA footage of significant events, to mundane NASA footage of the launch command at idle, etc., to random people in the crowd miles away waiting to watch the launch.  The film and sound restoration (?) was gorgeous as well.",0
640,"I was also a little surprised (although it shouldn't be surprising given the time period) at how conspicuously white everyone in the footage was.  There were exactly 3 black men, who were placed prominently in the editing, and a handful of other people of color went by quickly in a few of the crowd shots near the end once the astronauts made it back home.  Just a bit shocking to see, from a modern perspective, like the entire event almost didn't exist outside of white America. I saw this film last week in IMAX.",0
641,"It's beyond stunning what they were able to do with this footage. It's gorgeous. The sound is incredible, you feel and hear every rocket blast. ",0
642,"In my theater, I had a father sitting next to me with his kid and they were talking throughout the movie. Normally, I'd be annoyed, but I was just so happy for him to share the wonder of space with his son and answer his many questions. If it was amazing to me, a fully grown man, I'm sure it blew his little mind.",0
643,"It's not really a ""documentary"" in the normal sense, as it sacrifices the normal contextualizing of a documentary to put you 100% in the experience as it is happening. Worth seeing!!! It's certainly beautiful. Watching it, I genuinely would've thought they shot it on IMAX cameras a week ago, I have no idea how they made it look so good. As a film, I don't know! I enjoyed it, but it's also not the type of documentary you're used to seeing, with interviews and voiceover. I still don't know if that works for or against it, but I'd definitely recommend seeing it if you can, on the biggest screen you can. It's very interesting. Im 30, this blew me away, its like i got to live that time period. Fantastic Finally. I made an unofficial discussion yesterday because there was no sign of an official one. Alright, let’s talk. ",0
644,"Honest to god this might be one of the best documentaries I’ve ever seen and is EASILY the best film restoration in cinema history. The opening half hour with the lead-up and launch..... jaw dropping, and the best part is that it really doesn’t stop until the end (I mean the shots of the moon from the crafts when they’re approaching...... holy fucking shit). The movie flows so flawlessly well just like the mission itself that it almost mesmerizes you considering how “primitive” technology was compared to now. I really REALLY REALLY hope that this and First Man are re-released this July because I really think there are no two better films than these to help show a microcosm of the MASSIVE scope of sending men to the moon.  One thing I have always had problems with is picturing the scale of the Apollo rockets. I mean, I know they were big. I even searched out a building in my city that is the same height to get a perspective. ",0
645,"Seeing this film on an imax screen really made it feel big to me. And watched the launch actually seemed like I was watching an entire skyscraper lifting off. Things like this are why I still go to theatres. Some things just aren’t the same on a 55” screen at home.  Jaw on the floor from start to finish. Probably my favorite documentary ever made. The 65mm was incredible and the editing was right on the money. Personally loved the choice to not have a traditional narrator, but rather use mission control and television broadcasts to tell the story. The moon scenes were especially tense- the silence in between sentences during the moon broadcast added both suspense and a sense of realism to how people were watching live in 1969. ",0
646,&#x200B;,0
647,"Also thought Nixon's speech to Neil and Buzz on the surface was shockingly beautiful, and had to be one of the higher points in his career that I would have never known about for obvious reasons. Thought this was truly an innovative documentary for me. gonna steal my other comment from another thread since there wasn't a official discussion at the time",0
648,"watched it a few days ago. it's a absolute incredible experience and you don't have to know anything about space or the apollo missions to appreciate it. it was like watching interstellar (the music and sound design is amazing), but this happened for real lol.",0
649,"I almost got teary eyed watching this also, when the movie finished and as we were leaving our seats I noticed an elderly person wiping away his tears. made me wonder if he had anything to do with it or knew someone or something Anyone else cry when they detached Eagle for the last time? 😭😭😭 Apollo 11 is simply incredible. ",0
650,&#x200B;,0
651,Even if you've spent your whole life watching Apollo documentaries this film is a can't miss opportunity I assure you. Much of the pre-launch and launch footage is sourced from 65mm film that has never been presented before and much of it hadn't even been viewed at NASA before they lent it to the filmmakers. It was shot on a type of film developed for the military and produced for a partnership with a studio that fell through. The equipment to play it didn't even exist any more and special scanners had to be employed to play the footage.,0
652,"The footage from those reels is incredible, nearly grain free as if it were shot yesterday. While we have all seen the same Saturn launch stock footage from decades, this new film gives several new perspectives and in a clarity that I've never seen. The IMAX presentation is gorgeious visually and the sound is bone shaking. Even the footage from inside Mission control or just viewing the crowds is transporting, like time travel. Throughout much of the film, they have taken the time to try to sync up the usual mission control audio chatter with the matching filmclips whereever possible. Even some of the footage from inside the Apollo 11 craft is new I believe, and much I've never seen included in any other docs, probably due to their low framerates.",0
653,"There have been many, many documentaries about Apollo 11 and the whole Apollo program. We are lucky that the 50th anniversary of the moonlanding is being greeted with one of the absolute best. I definitely recommending finding the time this week to try to catch it before it gets pushed out of theaters. Come on people. Follow the rules and use spoiler tags. I'm waiting to see if there's a Elon Musk post credit scene and don't want to be spoiled.",0

655,"I was blown away. There were way too many times during that movie that I had to remind myself it was real footage and not something made via CGI, practical special effects, and so on. Especially with the launch sequence. I enjoyed this. ",0
656,"Like everyone else has stated, the launch and tension when the jets fire up is intense.  They also use this angle of the rocket climbing into the sky in slow motion, which was simply amazing and you feel like you are really there (which begs the question, why did they keep cutting away to crowd shots instead of just following the progress of the rocket?).",0
657,"Another scene I enjoyed immensely was probably within the first 15 minutes when you see the faces of Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins in such great detail.  Their expressions of confidence mixed with a bit of pensiveness is absolutely compelling.",0
658,"I do see how one could fall asleep during this movie, as the mission control voices are a bit of an effort to follow, and a little too technical for casual viewers.   ",0
659,"Nonetheless, seeing this mission in such great detail and looking at the sheer amount of technical expertise from NASA to make this happen is just dumbfounding.",0
660," What a great time capsule of film, seeing everyone from this era was so cool. I said it in another thread but of the 3 documentaries I've seen this year, this one was the ""Coolest."" ",0
661,They Shall Not Grow Old was more technically impressive with the restoration. Free Solo was harrowing and tense like a fictional film would make me feel. ,0
662,"Apollo 11 was just fucking cool. From the score, to the editing, to the choices to feature only recorded speech instead of interviews or narration. It was like a symphony bringing together so many different efforts and footage into what felt like a dramatization because it was all just so perfect. Speech synced up to the time, synced up to the lip movements of the speakers. Music synced up to the countdowns to make you deeply aware of the ticking clock even while it wasn't on screen. ",0
663,"I'm glad this will be going to science theaters later on, though I hope they choose effective edits for that.  Ha. one movie discussion thread where you dont have to worry about spoilers!

665,"Man, the kid who played Young Saroo was phenomenal. Just a fantastic performance.",1
666,"I really enjoyed the movie, except I felt like they rushed through Saroo's adopted childhood, and I would've liked to see more of that, to understand the dynamics between him and Mantosh. Man the scene where he finds home and meets his mom I thought was so well done. Well acted all around, had me tearing up.  Were...were those kids being taken as sex slaves? The type of rich, diverse stories that producers in the US should be buying/funding.  Great acting from both Saroos, great score (second only to Jackie, maybe?).  Two things that keep it from being overall great:  I think we needed more time with young Saroo in Australia and more time with adult Saroo before he becomes so obsessed.  As it is, it goes quickly from ""kid gets new home!"" to ""young adult still feels lost and kinda crazy"", and I could have used a little more of a bridge.  Awful, while the writing overall is pretty good, Nicole Kidman's speech about her vision of a brown boy in the field...brutal.  Overall, really good flick. How was Patel's Australian accent? Because from the snippets I heard from the trailer I thought it had the potential to be one of the best, if not the best, Australian accents of all time. I feel sorry for the real life Mantosh, whose portrayal in this film was pretty harsh. I don't recall the book suggesting he had drug problems. He interacts with the family and works for his dad's company. ",1
667,"Judging by a comment on his Facebook page, he found the interpretation of his character offensive and hurtful.",1
668,"Saroo handled it fairly sensitively in the book, not giving too much away, but they seem to have used stretched the limits of poetic license in the film. I'm really happy to see this thread. I was looking at an old one from before the movie came out and I found a lot of nasty comments about how Saroo was stupid because he didn't know his way home. We are all commenting on computers and technology that comes so easily to us that some people don't even realize their privilege. He knew how to get to his home by himself from places near by, but he ended up extremely far away. He mispronounced the name of a small village that might not have been on any map. The movie ended saying that 80,000 children are lost in a year, there aren't the resources to try everything to reunite each child. They put his picture in the news paper, but his family couldn't afford a news paper and a news paper may not have even reach their village. He was also uneducated and when moved in with his adoptive family, it was the first time he ever saw a map. Also, unlike in the countries most of us are from, I read that he feared going to the police, because they didn't help beggars and would just bring him to an orphanage. A lot of people on the street were unwilling to help and they ignored him. I was also heartbroken to see people call her a bad mother. Yes, in our privilege countries, parents would get in trouble for letting their child do all the things that he did and she would be considered a bad mother, but we don't understand that poverty: to not be able to feed your family, to work for hours and get maybe a rupee, to beg for scraps just to get by while still being hungry. Being a single parent is hard even in privileged countries (#spoiler) This movie fucked me up. Our problems are so trivial comparatively.",1
669,"Beautiful film. Sunny Pawar should win best supporting actor, if not best actor, at the Oscars for real. So was the brother hit by the train that night? My friends and I thought the writing at the end was a tad confusing. It would have made sense if so because that's why he didn't come back for Saroo. Either way, so sad once we read that news :(",1
670,"Really enjoyed the movie, I hadn't seen Dev Patel in anything since Slumbdog Millionaire, he's just FANTASTIC. He also got extremely handsome. Great movie. Definitely lopsided though, just because the first half was so much more engaging with young Saroo being so phenomenal and the stakes so much higher. Dev Patel was great but 10 minutes or so could've easily been shaved from the back half, or maybe shown more time in India.",1
671,"I agree that Mara's character wasn't great... but the lowest point for me was the monologue by Kidman. I mean, most of it was powerful when she was talking about loving both kids and choosing not to adopt, but it really suffered from that bit about ""having visions at age 12 about adopting a little brown boy."" And she keeps referring to the kid as ""it."" And does this mean she refused to adopt asian or black kids because her vision specified the kid had to be brown? It was very silly and contrived. I wonder if it's because the real-life mother had a bit a religious streak that they felt obligated to touch upon.",1
672,"All in all, definitely deserves the oscar nom although some flaws from the back half make it hard to say it deserves to win.",1
673,"But seriously, Young Saroo running was the cutest fucking thing.  It was a good film, though there are some flaws. Rooney Mara's character felt like a tacked on love interest that barely affected the plot. It felt a little too serious or over-dramatized at times, I know the guy was troubled over his past but at times there could have been a few more moments of joy.",1
674,"Still, it has a great musical score. The movie also managed to keep a great flow of the events, keeping it from losing suspense. Young Saroo was amazing. Really great perfomrance. Very believable. ",1
675,"Those ""trafficking"" scenes really hurt and I still think about.  Held back a lot of tears at the end, especially the scene where [Kidman talks about how she can have children.  What a powerful scene.](#spoiler)  I am grown ass man and I found myself crying like a little bitch while watching this movie. I felt the worst for his bro Guddu. In some way he was spared the pain of not seeing his brother for the 25 years and probably feeling guilty for having taken him with him. This was just a purely emotional and beautiful movie.  I completely lost it with the bike riding flashback at the end on the train tracks... Haven't cried for a film that hard in a while. The first half in India is amazing. The last 20 minutes starting when Saroo stumbles upon his home town is amazing. That middle half hour was not very good and holds it back from being truly great.",1
676,"The first 2/3 of the movie I kept thinking to myself ""Lion.....why is this movie called Lion? I'm sure there's some symbolism that'll show up later to clarify."" As the last act unfolded, I forgot all about it. Then those text overlays popped up at the end....added a great deal of frission to the emotions I was already feeling.",1
677,God damn those last twenty minutes are so powerful. Holy damn.,1
678,"I agree with the criticism that Rooney Mara's character is wasted. His adoptive brother, though, I feel is a bit crucial to this movie. That relationship needed more attention. A big theme of this movie is the relationship between brothers. It starts and ends with Saroo and Guddu. Guddu is constantly appearing in his thoughts and dreams (more than his mom I felt like). There is definitely a thread here that the director tried to explore but it isn't very well realized.   I'm from Melbourne and it was so surreal seeing places I actually know on the big screen ",1

681,"Reading a little about the actual story, I would have liked to see more of the real details included in the movie (apparently he rode multiple local trains around Kolkata for a few days before leaving the train station) but understand why they weren't included. I would have also liked a little more backstory on the brother and delving more into Saroo's relationship with him vs that of his with Guddu. ",1
682,"Did anyone else think it was odd that Saroo never mentioned his sister? I think it was because he was closer to his brother but it was odd that he only mentioned that his mother and brother were looking for him, but never mentioned Sheikla, his sister. ",1
683,I loved the cinematography - the overhead shots to mirror the shots from Google Earth were great. ,1
684,"Not a dry eye in our theater at the end - I really loved it.  I'll tear up during a movie every now and then, but I full on cried like 4 times. Not a perfect movie by any means, but damn good.  I loved this movie portrayed being adopted and not really connecting with the culture of the country you were born in. When he had trouble eating with his hands, people asking where he is from, etc...",1

I'm more Canadian than I will ever be Chinese. I loved this movie. As a whole I understand why some people thought it was slow in the middle, but I thought there were so many great scenes (the scene where the kids are learning the names of the utensils??? So great.) I cried hysterically about 100 times, but 3 scenes stick out to me:",1
687,"-The scene where Saroo meets with the lady at the orphanage, and before he leaves he stops and asks, ""Did you really look for my Mum?"" Sunny Pawar absolutely slayed that scene and the actress playing the woman was great, too.",1

690,"You know damn well Cheney uses Listerine just like that This movie was comically clever at times. The movie was a bit sloppy with its narrative structure. But the performances were strong. It’s a B level movie. It’s far from perfect. But, it has moments great moments. Yo uh, someone fill me in on if they show the dude getting shot in the face and please tell me it was played for laughs. I feel like I missed something but Sam Rockwell was only on screen for like 10 minutes right? The part about Dick's heart being healthier than ever and how they're out of politics and raising labrador retrievers made me laugh out loud, the swelling music was brilliant Thought this was good. All of them were perfect in their portrayals, except maybe Steve Carrell. Moreso as he has a very distinct look/voice so I saw it less as Rumsfeld and more of an older version of Carrell himself, but that's more on me than him I suppose, he did great in the role overall. I liked the fakeout credits and when they went Shakespearean. The most annoying thing in this movie is the narrative structure. McKay doesn't let scenes play out on their own. Jesse Plemons' narration keeps butting in most of the time or it cuts to something else. Quite frankly, it made me feel annoyed and patronized. Annoyed because I'm trying to watch a movie and I feel like someone is just trying to talk over it. Patronized because I feel like the movie is too scared to lose people so they have to keep the movie fresh by shoving 14 graphics in your face every 5 minutes. ",1
691,"Where it really lost me was when Cheney was mulling over the idea of being VP while using mouthwash. And the movie cuts in between lines of dialogue to say ""What was Dick Cheney thinking that day?"" And other stuff. It felt like I was being read a Dr. Suess book. ",1
692,"I understand that this is McKays style in The Big Short too but it worked in The Big Short. It just doesn't work here because he does it way too much.  Aside from the weird editing, I think the biggest problem with the film is McKay’s approach. ",1
693,"It’s somehow both patronising and not dumbed down enough. It speaks down to the audience about the basics but dedicates all of a few seconds to far more complex topics. The unitary executive theory for example. The film spends at least 15 minutes explaining and re-explaining that, when it’s really not hard to grasp. Meanwhile Cheney’s entire motivation for Iraq is explained with a 5 second shot of a map of oil fields and a 20 second conversation about Halliburton’s billing practices. That’s fine for people who know their recent history, but those same people don’t need the concept of Presidential executive power hammered home two dozen times. I’m not sure who this movie was meant for.",1
694,"It’s like if The Big Short spent 15 minutes explaining what a mortgage is and only 30 seconds explaining mortgage-backed securities. I mean, a good portion of the movie takes place after the credits...",1
695,"I enjoyed it, but not as much as I had expected to with those involved. Funny, but not hilarious. Interesting, but not super revealing. I know there's some criticism that Bale is just doing an impersonation but I think I prefer that for the lead than let's say what Carrell did for this type of movie.",1
696,"I will say I want to see that musical number on DVD, just for curiosity's sake. Ending of Anchorman is true",1
697,"Brick Tamland does end up in the George W. Bush adminstration every heart attack scene was great TIL everything is Dick Cheney's fault... [deleted] I don't know about anyone else, but the Shakespear bit had me dying. That and how apologetic Cheney would get when having a heart attack. ""Sorry guys, gonna have to go to the hospital."" I liked it. Emphasis on like. It was interesting, Bale was great, I thought it was well written. That said...",1
698,"The editing was all over the place. All the intercut shots were just not well done. The fishing cuts in the scene when he’s negotiating with W. Bush were great, but I can’t think of any others that made as much sense as that one. ",1
699,I understand the teacup analogy and what they were getting at with modern executive power but it felt unfinished. ,1
700,"There’s a lot about this movie I liked, but a lot more I didn’t like that I can’t quite put my finger on. I feel like I need to watch it again to understand why I left the theater so unfulfilled.  I definitely didn't like *Vice* as much as *The Big Short*, but I was still net positive on it. The acting was great, but the tone was kind of all over the place. I did still like the editing style.",1
701,I think the review embargo was smart. I'm not sure it gets 6 Globe nominations without it. I wouldn't be surprised if this only got a few Oscar nominations (and not Best Picture). Probably Christian Bale and Amy Adams. Maybe the editing or screenplay. 7/10. This movie had more jump scares than half the horror movies I watch.,1
702,"As someone who was too young to understand half the topics in the movie as they happened, I appreciated getting a timeline and connections of events. The scene with the feet under the tables was one of the best ever McKay needs to utilize his style in a docu-series or something. He has limits doing so in movies and it shows here.  I mean I would watch the shit out of Netflix’s McKay series if there’s one. I think Bush anxiously tapping his feet while addressing the nation being followed immediately by the scared civilian being bombed tapping his feet in fear is one of the most heartbreaking moments in the cinema this year. I watched this whole fucking movie thinking Jesse Plemons was Matt Damon. He gets me EVERY FUCKING TIME.  [deleted] I enjoyed it but I don’t think it comes close to The Big Short. Some funny bits like the mid movie credits, the Shakespeare scene, and the way Cheney reacts to his heart attacks. Bale was incredible as expected but I thought Rockwell was a bit over the top and Carell was out of place. A lot of the film also felt oversimplified since it was so scattered and they tried to get in as many topics as possible (energy, Fox News, corporate taxes, etc.). Just came off kinda preachy at some points even though I agreed with just about everything McKay was trying to say.",1
703," I just saw the movie, and while I agree with some of the criticisms, I also really enjoyed the film. ",1
704,"Something that really stood out to me is how Cheney’s main point of redemption throughout is his acceptance of his daughter being gay and refusal to speak out against gay marriage. I think ending the movie on him and Lynne giving approval to Liz to run against gay marriage was excellent and really got at the heart of the idea that, while Cheney is certainly a complex leader,  at the end of the day he wanted power and was prepared to do anything to keep it.  Christian Bale was absolutely great in this one. His portrayal of Chaney is classic and he accurately depicted the quintessential neo con mentality.",1
705,Idk if he will get a nomination for this.,1
706,Hank is the epitome of Reddit I think my favorite part was Dory's dads receding hairline.  Gerald and Hank stole the flipping show! Just found out I missed the post credits scene. I'm mad as hell. They took Dory's quirk and turned it into a heartbreaking rendition of mental illness and its effect on the entire family unit.  Every line that tiny Dory said killed me a little more.  Her poor parents! You know what's hilarious?,0
707,"Had Dory swam down when Marlin was yelling at her early on in the film after the squid scene, she would have found her family. The sea lions absolutely stole the movie for me!  This is the movie that The Good Dinosaur should have been. Same general plot, but this was far better executed. Ed O'Neill was fantastic and Ellen showed more range than I expected her to have considering she hasn't acted in years. ",0
708,The short was fantastic.  The whole Sigourney Weaver thing cracked me up.,0
709,I thought it did a good job not having the same plot as the first movie.,0
710,It was sufficiently funny.,0
711,"The new characters were enjoyable. Very nice movie. For a second, I thought Dory's parents counting down would lead to them leaving her behind. Thankfully, Pixar gets dark, but not THAT dark. Did anyone else think that the sea otter cooperation at the end was out of the blue? Perhaps a scene was cut out showing them interacting explaining why they'd listen to em?  Also, I feel like I've been watching that Secret Life of Pets trailer for like three years. Sigourney Weaver's performance as Sigourney Weaver was phenomenal.  The new characters were wonderful! Also, I was in stitches at the van falling off the cliff with Louis Armstrong playing in the background.",0
712,"Edit: Btw, the animation for Hank was AMAZING. My  whole theater let out a collective AAWWW when baby Dory showed up on screen. The most unrealistic part was believing that anyone actually wants to go to Cleveland. Who played that clam in the Tide Pool. I was dying that part was hilarious!  When baby Dory sadly sings ""just keep swimming""........goddammit Pixar ! The recurring Sigourney Weaver jokes were brilliant.  When they panned up to show all the shell pathways; the tears started to flow. Great job, Pixar! I love the fact that octopuses are always trying to escape captivity and Pixar twisted it so that Hank was only trying to escape so he could be kept in captivity.  Can we talk about how great that short at the beginning was? I enjoyed Idris Elba as the seal the most I think the movie did a fantastic job of calling back to the original, but not over doing it. The perfect amount of old jokes. ",0
713,"They took Dory and instead of constantly beating you with ""remember how funny it is when she forgets things!"" for an hour and a half they made it have a purpose. They did a really good job at turning dory from comedic relief character to the main character without sacrificing the quality of the movie. ",0
714,The fun fact octopus three heart jokes was hysterical.  Young Dory is the cutest thing I have ever seen in my life.,0
715,That is all.,0
716,I loved the tension between Peter and Phil in their last scene together. ,1
717,"Peter’s character surprised me the most, and I didn’t think he could be that calculating. I think the main problem is that the main theme in the book was discarded completely, namely that of parents who are not there at all for their children (both physically and mentally). ",1
718,"The title of the book and the movie is one of the Psalms - the one that starts O father why hast thou forsaken me. This is also what Jesus said on the cross, when he doubted his father. I think it can be argued that a very big theme in the book is parents who are distant and not very good parents.",1
719,"This explains why no one in the book/movie ever calls their parent ""mother"" or ""father"" - it's always ""the old man/lady"" or ""rose"". The book has lots of scenes about the parents of the different characters that have been omitted in the movie. ",1
720,"And another thing. Phil's parents KNOW he is gay. They are ok with it as long as he lives far away from them with his dimwit brother who is ALSO a disgrace to the family. In the book there is a heart breaking scene where the parents console each other and assure themselves that ""it is not our fault"" (that Phil ended up as he did).",1
721,"Taking out the bitter criticism of the parental generation and of parents who do not take responsibility for their kids leaves the story a little thin in my opinion. The refreshing thing about this movie is that it’s a Western that doesn’t end with a shootout. It uses the Western setting perfectly without falling into the boring tropes of the genre. Something I'm unsure about - Is cattle ranching a truly lucrative career? Or were the Burbank boys LARPING as cowboys because they come from old money and can do as they please? I figured it was the latter, which adds a layer of regressivessness to Phil, but I'm not so sure. I don't get the hype. It was fine but I can't understand how it's Oscar worthy. Sure, it's artsy but it's not overly entertaining As awful as Phil was, it was oddly sad to see him walking around, half dead already, desperately trying to get that rope to Peter, not knowing that Peter was the one that killed him. I was really surprised to see Thomasin McKenzie in a minor role that didn‘t matter at all. I mean she’s not an A-lister but a bit too important to play “random maid #1“. Can someone explain the rings at the end? Was confused about that scene. The nesting birds in the tree was a very powerful scene. Peter not paying a single bit of attention to the ranch hands yelling profanities at him, and instead confidently walking over to the tree to observe the birds. Clearly a turning point in the movie in terms of how Phil views Peter. ",1
722,"Phil sees in Peter something that he could never do, be confident and open with his sexuality. So Phil envied that aspect of Peter, and in turn invited Peter to learn from him. Albeit we quickly see Phil's true agenda is to strip away and remold Peter into something more reminiscent of himself. I'm assuming by doing this Phil could have another Bronco. If Phil is able to turn Peter into a cowboy, then they could go onto have a romantic relationship just like Phil and Bronco did. I watched this movie last night and I have been getting sadder about it all day. So I read all 567 comments on this thread. Only a few mentioned having felt sad about the thing that absolutely seems to have gutted me. That is Phil's betrayal and murder, and this in spite of that fact that in terms of modern conventions of morality and sensibilities about bullying, racism, misogyny, and homophobia, Phil only really got what was coming to him. This also in spite of the fact that, like several other commenters, the atmosphere of dread and fear in the house because of Phil was immediately recognizable and viscerally real to me because my Dad was like that. Some people didn't understand Rose's paralysis in the face of it but I do. It's not the cruelty alone that breaks you down. It's your own powerlessness to confront it that does you in.",1
723,"That said, the most powerful storylines in the world for me are the redemption ones. That's why I loved Bram Stoker's Dracula back in the day. Cumberbatch so remarkably portrayed a guy with a vast inner life that was utterly alone and which would be completely illegible to anyone in his universe that his viciousness reads as a snarling, biting rage and hate for a world that first hated him and that taught him to hate himself. He has only ever been loved once, and the memory of the power and wonder of it gives him what internal life he has.  So, in a way that this world's valorization of toxic masculinity has taught us, the audience, to admire as much is it informed Phil's brutal performance of what in fact was once the masculine ideal, he teaches all around him to fear him as totally unassailable. He pulls it off with a certain flair, maintaining a panache and keen and cruel wit that leads a certain kind of person to also admire him. And he surrounds himself with that kind of men. ",1
724,"In order for this movie to work, you have to believe in the possibility of an inner life that is at once enormous and hidden. We see it in Phil's ""secret place,"" in which he enters his inner life and lets his inner self out into the light in the safety of solitude. There is a striking moment when Peter finds his way to the edge of the pond where Phil is bathing and Phil turns his head, sees the intruder, and instantly dons the mantle of a wolf, reflexively and almost animalistically driving the intruder away from his exposed and vulnerable self. ",1
725,"Benedict Cumberbatch said of Phil's character that, if the movie had done its work, you came to understand that Phil wasn't a monster, and that to the extent we as a people can empathize with him we progress, and to the extent we only wish him harm we stagnate. I was glad I read that, because it validated my sense that this movie was and could only be understood as tragic if we had come to value Phil's life. ",1
726,"The reason it gutted me was that Phil was tiptoeing toward finding connection with someone. He was finally starting to trust. That is such a terrifying place to be, we've all feared the horror of what it would mean to trust someone with some truth of ourselves and to be met with cruelty or ridicule or rejection. The shame, the embarrassment, the grief of it are among those things I think we fear more than anything else; certainly it was the thing Phil feared the most. And so here we have this guy who is godawful and vicious but whose feral self-defensiveness is protecting something pure against a world that is just as horrible to him as he is to it, who is finally taking small steps toward what could be redemptive. But he has trusted someone he probably felt safe around, based on the mistaken assumption that Peter was weak and therefor not a threat. And he is made a fool of in it; what he sees as tenderness is actually concealing the reality that what he thought was an emerging connection was false, and even through the last evening in the barn when the two were close and almost intimate, Peter is pretending all along as he methodically is carrying out Phil's murder. ",1
727,"When I heard that final line, that it could have been anthrax, and George saying that Phil never handled sick animals, and my mind started going back over the events of the last half the movie, I at first shied away from the obvious conclusion. I mean, I read reviews before I watched the movie, I knew there was going to be something tragic, and I figured Phil was going to kill someone, or drive someone to suicide. But in spite of the fact I was waiting for tragedy, I was not prepared for Peter to have killed Phil. In the end, in spite of every sadistic, cruel thing he was, I mourned Phil. Can someone explain to me the meaning behind Phil and baths? And him putting the mud on himself then taking a bath?",1
728,"And the hulahoop scene? Haha Hi all,",1
729,"I just re-watched this movie again last night with my father, I haven't read the book, so please forgive my ignorance if this is mentioned in it. ",1
730,"We were catching all the subtle hints sprinkled throughout the feature, but, one thing that really stood out to us, was the scene where Rose is asking Peter if there's if there's a sound that makes him shutter. To which he denies. But, then, you can see he begins to get teary eyed and begins to pluck the comb teeth again.",1
731,"Now, I missed the similarity of the sound relation entirely. But my dad said, ""oohhhhhh, the comb sounds like a rope under tension!"" y'know.. Kinda like how Peter found his father? *creak* *creak*",1
732,"And it all made a whole lot more sense, the animosity that was had towards Phil, once one redditor had revealed they'd left out the crucial information from the book, that he'd actually tormented the boys father, much like he does the everyone.",1
733,Great movie. Thoughts:,1
734,"1. ""Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog"" = Deliver Peter from toxic masculinity; deliver Rose from alcoholism.   ",1
735,"I've seen people saying that the ""dog"" refers to Phil, but in this case I think it is a play on words. ""Hair of the dog"" (short for ""Hair of the dog that bit you"") refers to alcohol that is consumed with the purpose of curing a hangover. Peter wants to save his mother from alcoholism, and he needs to change Phil or get rid of him to do that.   ",1
736,2. Peter's dad hung himself with a rope.   ,1
737,"Phil was making a rope for Peter; the rope was intended to help Peter metaphorically kill himself (personality-wise), to become a ""man"" in Phil's eyes.  ",1
738,"Peter keeps making the comb sound throughout the film, which as another redditor here pointed out, sounds like a creaking rope. The film makes you feel like Peter and Rose are slowly suffocating, like they are already hanging but not dead.   ",1
739,"3. Phil seems to starts to change in the end, but it is too little too late. He loses the hides (which he wanted to keep to make the rope, to form a bond with peter) because he has always burned them, and so people assumed he is just going to destroy and burn them.   ",1
740,"Phil metaphorically burns people, too. Even if he was truly planning on changing his behavior towards peter and his mother, it was already too late; he had already established his behavior and so people dont trust him. Does anyone else think that Peter could have killed his father?  He tells Phil he found him and cut him down.  If he was drunk all the time could Peter have killed him?  He was the only witness to his death.  Play close attention to the beginning of the movie when Peter is narrator.  (“What kind of man would I be if I didn’t help my mother, if I didn’t save her?”  His father’s year of death was 1921 on the headstone, it’s now 1925.  How old would Peter have been 4 years ago?  Does Peter just remove anyone that harms his mother? One of my favorite little things about the movie I think is underrated is the sound. Hearing Phil's spurs ring even when he was nowhere near being on-screen really gave you a sense of him always being there, and really added to the aura of power he gives off. I absolutely loved this movie. What a knockout of an ending. Man I got this movie completely wrong. I thought it was a love story between Peter and Phil, in nowhere in my mind think Peter would actually kill him...",1
741,"I thought Peter was coming to realization that he was different and gay and he saw Phil was experienced in the lifestyle he wanted. Like when Phil woke up that morning all sweaty I thought they fucked, not that he was dying. And when he died, I thought he died from aids from his previous lover. ",1
742,Man oh man did I get this movie wrong. What a great performance by Benedict Cumberbatch. Jonny Greenwood's score should be nominated.,1
743,"I've always been impressed with Jane Campion's work. Her films are often haunting and erotic, with interesting characters and relationships. What's weird is I felt really bad for Phil by the end. He was finally beginning to open up and that was all taken away. I see it as a tragic series of events that leads to his death. Well I think this was a masterpiece. The acting, cinematography, score and direction were stellar and it made good use of the sound design to create this subtle but unrelenting tension. ",1
744,"It was really compelling for me but I can see how one might find it boring. However,  I don't really understand the reactions in this thread calling it mediocre and lacking in nuance as well as character development. Nothing much happens plotwise but the build-up in tension is masterful and the film gradually reveals a lot about the characters whilst being quite subversive. Not really sure what else people want from it because this is far better than most films which are released. That's just me though. Not trying to invalidate other peoples' opinions. I thought it was pretty good overall. It was an interesting story and the performances are all obviously really solid. The soundtrack was really fitting as well in giving off that uneasy, ominous atmosphere. By the end, the movie gave me vibes of a cross between There Will Be Blood and Brokeback Mountain. ",1
745,"The only aspect that felt a little off (and it sounds like others feel the same way) and kept it from being a great movie in my mind, was in how most of the characters felt like they reacted to Phil in seemingly disproportionate ways. I know there was a lot of subtlety to his menace and the way he would torment the other characters, and maybe it's just a case of the movie being paced in a weird way, but it felt like his actions usually evoked a response that was simultaneously too passive and too overboard for the other characters. To be clear, I'm not saying ""Phil wasn't actually that bad"" or anything like that. The dude was a grade A asshole for sure. But maybe murdering him with anthrax was a little bit of overkill in terms of dealing with him. I just kept waiting for a moment where someone, anyone, would actually lash out or at least attempt to, and just raise the stakes a little bit. I mean, yeah, Rose sold off his pelts against his wishes, but that was after she'd already basically given up and resorted to alcohol to deal with her issues. I feel like it would have been more effective if she'd tried fruitlessly to confront Phil, only for her situation to not improve, and then start to break down from there. But for a large part of the movie, Phil is just a bully and everyone tiptoes around him rather than doing anything about it. I thought Peter's scheme in the back half of the movie was a good change of pace in that it felt like one of the characters was finally stepping up to do something, and the characters were finally starting to actually play off each other. The most interesting aspect of the movie was that sort of inverse dynamic of Peter ""seducing"" Phil with the ultimate intent to get revenge, especially when you consider how you know Phil probably thinks he's the one grooming Peter and getting one over on Rose, and I kind of wish more of the movie was centered around that dynamic. It was sort of like the predator doesn't realize he's actually the prey. But when it came to Rose and George, it seemed like they never reacted to Phil with any sense of agency, which wouldn't be a problem if Phil was portrayed as exerting genuine power over them, but it never felt to me like Phil was so overbearing and so overtly abusive as to actually restrict the other characters' agency. And if he was and it was just too subtle to pick up on it, then I still wish those characters would have put up some kind of resistance to it. I think I just found myself frustrated that Rose and George never actually confronted Phil in any meaningful way. It very much feels like a movie where the characters just don't quite feel connected to each other in a satisfying way, which is to say that the performances and writing of the characters are great on an individual basis, but they sort of feel incompatible together. To put it a different way, the individual parts were greater than the sum of those parts, in my opinion. I was super excited to see this movie, and it left me lukewarm. I have no problem with de-construction, but this one just didn’t do it for me. It’s extremely well shot, Cumberbatch is really good, and the score is good, but otherwise I think it’ll be one of those movies that’s forgotten by next year. My favorite scene was when she’s practicing the piano and can’t get it right, and then Phil on the banjo joins in to mock her. I wanted a post-credits scene where Dunst is struggling at the piano, and Plemons walks in and says ""My love, I've got you a teacher!"" and in walks Holly Hunter Can someone explain to me why Rose was unhappy when the governor and George’s parents visited? Why she refused to play the piano? Does anyone else think that George's well-dressed behavior since the beginning of the movie might be a new habit?",1
746,"That he is trying to change and is already going to Rose's house interested in her, hence the clothes.",1
747,"That's why Phil teases him from the beginning, because he already knows.",1
748,"The difference between Phil and George's clothes play a narrative role. And maybe his ""dressing better""\* is his attempt to be something other than a cowboy. Which also bothers Phil.",1
749,"I just feel so mad that this amazing festival was left to languish in relative obscurity until now, despite the massive talent surrounding it.  How?  Why? That moon landing & Staple Singers performance segment is a masterclass of editing. ",0
750,"This whole film was terrific. The gobsmacking solo rendition of “My Girl” by Temptations singer David Ruffin is alone worth the watch. Wow. But there are so many absolutely incredible performances captured beautifully on film. The documentary context of the event is also well done, but there were several times when I was watching some mind-blowing performance and then they cut to an interview and I was like noooooooo!! So hopefully someday they release “Summer of Soul: The Full Performances,” which I would buy in a heartbeat. So damn good. I knew all these artists going in but I’d never heard these versions. Gladys Knight & The Pips, Sly & The Family Stone, and Nina Simone at the end were all flat out spectacular. Fantastic doc. I really loved Quest’s exchange with Darryl (I believe that’s who it was) at the end. I can only imagine how it must have felt knowing that this really did happen, and it wasn’t just a moment stored in someone’s collective memory bank, but also so far removed that it felt like it didn’t really happen. Hope it makes the Documentary list for the Oscars next year The Mavis Staples - Mahalia Jackson footage is the most transfixed I’ve been to the screen this past year. That’s the best scene of any movie I’ve watched in awhile. ",0
751,The direction by Questlove is revelatory. Brilliant all around. It was really good but I wish they had more info on the original cinematographer who held onto the footage for 50 years and included some info about how this film came to be. ,0
752,I really appreciated they cultural context stuff - the moon landing stuff was really interesting and gave me a perspective on history I wasn’t taught in school. ,0
753,I really hope they can get the licenses together and put a compilation record out. It would be incredible.,0
754,"The editing was great too. I just finished watching it and it is making me so hype. It’s not just about the music, and as a music teacher that is a total NERD for music history, this is incredible. But hot damn, the music (which I grew up with), is insanely phenomenal. I would buy the box set of this whole festival. One of the best music docs I’ve seen in a while. Excellent footage. Really loved this. I actually live across the street from Mt. Morris Park, and it was really incredible to think all of this took place right outside my window fifty years ago. I think my personal highlights were Mahalia Jackson letting the spirit of four hundred years pour right out of her, and then the end with Nina Simone being so amazing and powerful in the way that only she can. Well done, Questlove. If this were just a collection of performance footage, it would be four stars. The interviews and the culture/historical context push it to the top level. It was such a great decision to include so many interviews with regular festival-goers. ",0
755,"Also, Stevie Wonder is a goddamn performer. Wow. I went into this looking forward to the music, and the music was spectacular. But about 30 minutes into it I was more interested in what Questlove was trying to say with the film. There are some insanely powerful moments in this movie.",0
756,"Also, watch to the very end of the credits. There's a little clip at the end that's hilarious and worth waiting for. I saw this as part of Sundance's online festival this year.  It's really good, the archival film is great, some terrific performances, and great stories. Let’s not forget the Latino and African performers too. It was a great melding of so many genres. I hope we will see a release of full performances from all the bands/singers. The extended title of this film includes: **(or... When the Revolution Could Not be Televised)** ",0
757,"and I feel like that's quintessential to the name of and discussion of the doc. Anyone know what that was all about with stevie at the end of the credits? This was amazing and beautiful. Can’t believe I didn’t know this happened or existed. Stellar performances, fantastic fashion, the colors and variety of artists. I’ll be honest, I teared up a few times. Wonderful. This was the uplifting watch I needed after that heavy Woodstock doc. Seeing Stevie go all out was amazing. It’s REALLY good. I was worried it would be more concert film than documentary, but it’s the PERFECT blend of both. Go watch this. Thank goodness for Questlove. His music history drive is truly amazing. ",0
758,"Misty eyed from the second Little Stevie Wonder threw down on the drum set. Yeah i need a box set of this. Want to see the performances without commentary (even though its great) they did sonny sharrock dirty by only showing a tiny bit of his performance with all that other music/commentary on top of it. FREE JAZZ FOREVER Totally going to watch this now, thanks for the heads up. What a great film,  awesome music, and spectacular fashion and dances.",0
759,"Amazing look at the era, and so much fun to see the artists watch themselves and get so emotional I guess I'm disappointed becuse it wasn't what i was expecting  i went in  expecting a modern-day Wattstax,  Not a  traditional documentary documentary reflecting on the  politics and music  and of the era and it's meaning to the black community which is fine. I'll  give  2nd chance now that i know that.",0
760,Still I feel quest love should have let the footage speak for it's self more.,0
761,"The bagpipes. THE BAGPIPES Anyone else feel like the importance of water was a miss? I was especially disappointed that they cut Paul crying after killing Janis. I always felt that his giving of his bodies water at the death of Janis and honoring him in that way, in the eyes of the Fremen, was a significant contributor to their initial acceptance of him. ",1
762,I had a giant ass grin on my face when Kyne brought out the hooks. I wish I had a recording of my face going from ecstatic to horrified when she died; what a great tease. ,1
763,I was really disappointed the dinner scene didn't make it in but also understand how hard a scene like that would be to convert to film. ,1
764,"Ultimately I thought it was an incredible adaptation of a book that I always thought would be impossible to convert to visual media correctly. The visuals were stunning. Especially the space-faring vessels. Fucking awesome. It turns out I've been mispronouncing pretty much everything from the Dune universe Felt like Skarsgard used Brando in Apocalypses Now as inspiration. Some of the shots and mannerisms felt the same I just watched it on IMAX. I was bummed out not because the film was bad, but because I didn’t want the film to end and it did. I became deeply invested and I left the theater wanting the story to continue. Let’s hope Part II gets made. Despite being 2 1/2 hours long, there seemed to be a lot of things not in this film. The Voice shook the damn theater. Thought I was going to shit myself, it was nuts. Did anyone else notice the interior of the large navigator ship? It had a giant reflection of a planet like it was being seen through a massive lens.. Folding space never looked so good. Oscar Isaac was born to act in sci-fi films lmfao [removed] Whoever they cast for that Imperial Herald was GREAT I was surprised and impressed how much they committed to different houses/cultures speaking in entirely different languages that needed subtitles, when they easily *could* have just had them speak to each other openly (Sardaukar, Harkonnens, etc).  Way more subtitles than they really “had to” use.  But it really emphasized how entirely distinct some of these groups are from each other. I really enjoyed Leto and Paul's interactions. It was refreshing to see a loving father and son relationship under the pressure of royalty. Leto was understanding of Paul's trepidation. thufir's mentat eyes flipping and turning that milky white while he computed was so damn cool I just can't stop thinking about clean shaven Momoa, such a weird sight. “I recognize your footsteps, old man.”",1
765,"I’m currently reading God Emperor so this line gave me chills. This movie has the greatest gigantic-empty-room-to-furniture ratio I’ve ever seen. Rooms the size of a basketball court, fifty foot ceilings, furnished with two chairs and bench. Maybe I'm forgetting, but what happened with Josh Brolin's character after the attack? A guy just hanging out with his cool mom. Great flick. Oscar Isaac has an amazing beard. Im shook.",1
766,"Honestly, I havent felt this way about a movie and the experience itself since maybe The Dark Knight. Say what you want about the movie but no one can deny that Paul has some great jackets. What the *hell* was the spider thing on Giedi Prime? The way Paul kills Jamis is the same move bull fighters use. The sardakar quietly floating down before battles was so damn cool.   Not sure if that was movie specific but those entrances were so ominous I loved it",1
767,"I didn’t fully understand the casting against type with the men until Al Monroe (Chris Lowell) showed up, and I was like full pikachu face OH. The fact that the men were purposely chosen because they were known as “harmless” really speaks to the film’s message. In retrospect, I should have got the message when McLovin appeared.",1
768,"I was so so so hopeful that Ryan (Bo Burnham) would do the right thing. I kept expecting him to burst through the door while Cassie was alone with Al. I think Ryan’s complete spinelessness stung so much because we have all known that “good guy.” Casting all of the men's roles with likable, comedic actors was a really brilliant casting trick. It's hitting me harder the more I think about it. The fact that part of me wanted her to forgive Ryan just because he was charming & funny says a lot about how we're quick to give men second chances, all while brushing their victims aside. The movie was incredible : it somehow manages to indulge revenge fantasies while also subverting their guilty pleasures.",1

770,"So while Nina's gang (?) rape and suicide are avenged by Cassandra, the film chronicles the self destructive nature of revenge itself.",1
771,&#x200B;,1

773,&#x200B;,1
774,The fact that the film also succeeds as an indictment of rape culture is equally incredible: it was able to call into question  shameful social norms and attitudes through her own questionable actions.,1
775,&#x200B;,1
776,The casting againgst type was one of the film's many coups or strategic   manoeuvres - it reinforced the theme of the normalization of rape  culture (or the everyday fact that rapists and rape apologists don't come with warning signs  and are amongst the people we normally like and trust),1

778,&#x200B;,1
779,"Carey Mulligan was simply amazing in the role - she conveyed a person \*already\* dead inside briefly reanimated through vengeful wrath. The refusal to say the words “rape” or “assault” was intentional, yeah? As a former grocery store worker, I would like to let it be known that the moment Ryan popped all those chips out of the bag in the middle of the aisle during his dance, I knew he was a monster. “Your parents must be very proud of you being a doctor.” “Well actually they wanted me to be a DJ.” The hardest i’ve laughed in a movie in a VERY long time. This movie is absolutely incredible and truly important, but it’s also straight up hysterical often. Loved the tonal balance! Some parts of the movie I really liked:",1
780,"\- Carey Mulligan flinching when Alfred Molina made sudden movements toward her - god knows how many dangerous situations Cassie had been in with other men, I thought that was a realistic reaction",1
781,"\- Ryan calling Cassie a ""stupid bitch"" when telling her he loved her was a little jarring on first viewing, even as a cute lil joke... Made total sense in retrospect. Comments like that made by men, even when unintentional, even when packaged in a cute way, give affirmation to misogynists. Just like the character of Ryan as whole. Ofc women and queer folk have reclaimed words like bitch and slut for themselves, but I can't really get behind straight men saying them. Until they become fully gender-neutral terms, at least.",1
782,"\- Alison Brie bordering on breaking the fourth wall while walking into Cassie's parents Weirdly Baroque sitting room. Seems like production just wanted to shoot on a cool-looking set and was like, fuck it, we don't need to explain it I highly respect Emerald for changing the ending to that, and refusing a John Wick (Not to disrespect such) ending. Gut punch ending, but she and Cassie made sure it hit sound. Every Bo Burnham line in this was fucking gold. It sucked when we realized who his character really was, as it likely did for Cassie. Fennell fucking killed it. Just finished watching this and wow it was honestly spectacular. I'm a young guy and I think the portrayal of men my age was so perfect. Life is hard for young women especially in this day and age and a lot of college aged guys are absolute pigs, I've come across plenty of them.",1
783,"Not once did I feel the movie was pushing any female agenda or anti man agenda. It just felt real and it was a story that needed to be told. I definitely felt empowered after watching it. Oh also Carey Muligan was phenomenal!! When the dad told Cassie, “Nina was like a daughter to us, and we really miss her. But God we have missed you.” Goddammit that was heartbreaking. Her parents were so sweet. I couldn't get over how Max Greenfield's character basically turned into Schmidt in the bedroom scene, I was half-expecting him to yell ""WINSTON!"" or something.",1
784,"Swap out ""Al"" with ""Nick"" or ""Coach"" and his ""Al, why is the fucking stripper dead?"" line is straight out of a fucked up episode of New Girl. Casting the men with guys who all occupy cute/sweet/funny roles in pop culture is a pretty great choice. But the ending left a very bad taste in my mouth. I imagine that will be quite divisive once the film reaches a wider audience. I like the parallel of how Al is being comforted by his friend with “it’s not your fault” and “it’s going to be okay” after he kills Cassie. As if Al is the real victim in all this.  🙄. ",1
785,"It was like what a survivor might hear. “It’s not your fault” and “it’s going to be okay”, etc. It just stood out to me, cuz besides Cassie, Nina didn’t get that. Everyone blamed her, told her she deserved it, didn’t believe her, and these shitty doctor guys just comfort their poor shitty murderer creep groom-to-be.",1
786,"Self defense against Cassie? Sure, but I think the reason the film shows the full time it would take to suffocate someone speaks to how Al could have stopped at any point. He could overpower her without killing her. But he just kept going. I've said this before but I absolutely LOVE how this film weaponizes casting. Having all these beloved male comedy actors known for playing nice and adorable characters play rapists really reinforces that men should take a good long look at the ""Nice"" guys in their friend group. ‘Angel of the Morning’ was used perfectly. Powerful movie. It was interesting to see so many actors playing against type in this, and wonder if that was intentional. The men would be believable if cast as 'nice' guys, Jennifer Coolidge and Clancy Brown as the parents, etc. The first scene with Adam Brody really set the tone of the movie for me. Him at the bar with his colleagues and he talks about how it’s unfortunate business meeting are held at the golf course because woman are not a part of the decision making process. Turns out he’s fake woke! Good writing to make him seem like the trusted, nice guy Hoooly fuck.",1
787,I went into this movie having accidentally heard something about a suicide and a murder. So I assumed she murders a rapist and another one that gets caught kills himself. Nope.,1
788,"Saddest thing when the bedroom scene happened, I was legitimately floored. Stopped watching for a moment to pull up the Wikipedia page and spoil that line of plot because I could not believe it. It actually feels like someone you know in real life died. That’s rare. Could not watch that part, seeing her under the pillow. I felt so hopeless when she died and it seemed as if it was for nothing, with Al and the other guy trying to cover it up and reduce fault. Just pure dread as life seemingly goes on the exact way it shouldn’t.",1
789,I really wish she got to see the plan through.,1

794,"Been waiting to watch this ever since I saw the trailer this time last year and while I’m so glad I did, what an absolute gut punch. ashamed to say I recognized the Paris Hilton tune immediately even before Bo named it [deleted] What an amazing film, I haven't felt such a strong emotional connection to the protagonist since Rosamund Pike's Gone Girl performance.",1
795,"It left me feeling unsatisfied in a satisfying way, which is something I didn't expect from this movie. The trailer really didn't do this film justice, I went in thinking this would be kinda campy, but got the complete opposite.",1
796,"Everything about the soundtrack, the acting, and the cinematography was amazing, **except one part:** the mood and the editing in the pharmacy montage was just a really strange choice, it caught me off guard in what was supposed to be a film with dark themes. I know it was to get us invested in Cassie and Ryan's relationship, but the whole rom-com vibe just didn't seem to fit well with the rest of the film.",1
797,"Anyway, will definitely be recommending this movie to my friends, it was a very worthwhile watch and it's definitely on par with masterpieces like Gone Girl. I liked how the movie really fucked with our perception of Cassie. For most of the movie, I 100% believed she paid that guy to take advantage of Madison (Allison Brie). It makes you sit with that thought for a long time, and still root for a character who may have done something just as awful as Al and his friends. When it's finally cleared up that nothing happened, it's a bit of a sigh of relief that Cassie didn't do something so horrible, but she still made Madison believe it happened, and probably would never have told her the truth if she hadn't come to Cassie's house. ",1
798,"I also thought about the long, awful scene showing Cassie dying. The entire movie shies away from showing any assault. The guys Cassie goes home with always stop before it goes too far, we never see what happens with Madison, and we only hear what happens in the video of Nina. But when we get to Cassie being suffocated, we get the entire process, front and center, and it really shakes you as a viewer. It's clear that Cassie didn't fully expect or necessarily even want to die (even though she had those whole texting and mailing thing planned), which makes it more realistic unfortunately. Cassie easily walking in, drugging and hurting those guys and getting away scot free was an ending fit for a campy revenge thriller, but I'm glad the movie stuck with something darker and more realistic.",1
799,"Another thing, I've been thinking about the scene with Cassie and Nina's mom. Nina's mom seems much more happier and at peace than where Cassie is, so it shows that recovery and acceptance is possible, it's just a path that Cassie refused to take. I would've liked a little more focus on, or Nina's mom pointing out that Cassie wasn't the one assaulted. Nina was, but Cassie was putting this title of hard done by avenger on herself. ",1
800,"I don't know how I feel about Cassie achieving success and revenge in death. As I said, her ruining the lives of everyone and sitting back satisfied and at peace wouldn't of worked either, but it's still a very depressing conclusion that shows there's no happy endings in stories of sexual assault. Red vs. Black. ",1
801,"I noticed she was writing on her notebook, and sometimes it was with red ink, sometimes black. I was just wondering if there was any significance to the color? What are your thoughts on that? This movie was initially enjoyable as a viewer, but ultimately difficult to process as someone who has often fantasized about seeking revenge against those who have wronged me. The film really demonstrates the emotional, physical, and psychological toll that the pursuit of revenge can take on a person. In the end, the main character does achieve her goal of sending the rapist to prison (and on his wedding day no less), but at the cost of her own life. The ending should have been gratifying, but instead it left me feeling hollow, which I assume was the writers intention. I still wanted “the bad guy” to lose, but more than that, I also wanted “the good guy” to win (the good guy being the protagonist, Cassie.) The movie shows that unfortunately both men and women can be inherently “bad,” but few are capable of real change and redemption. At the same time, others may come across as “nice,” when in reality they are not as kind as they appear, while a rare, select few are truly “good.” Regardless, no one and nothing is worth putting before your own life and sanity. To me, this was not just a film about sexual assault, but also about the consequences of suffering from mental health issues.",1
802,"I went in blind seeing this, only knowing that it was a Japanese film and that it had major awards buzz. When the movie started and I saw that it was about an actor and a TV writer, I immediately thought ""oh here we go again, another movie that gets Oscar buzz because it's about actors, and there's nothing they love more than movies about actors and show business.""",1
803,"I was completely wrong. what a phenomenal movie and absolutely deserving of all the love. maybe it was the fact that I was in the theater and had to read subtitles and to made me have to completely focus on the film, but the scene with Yusuke and Koji in the car, where Koji continues the story that Oto was telling was one of the most intense scenes ever put on film, and it's literally just two men talking in a car.",1
804,"absolutely cannot recommend this movie enough I was captivated by the actress that used Korean sign language. Her story with her husband was the sweetest thing ever. The park scene and the final performance were each so emotional and beautiful for me I couldn’t help but tear up (and surprisingly both scenes were the most emotional for me for the entire movie). So much expression in the way she communicated without saying a single word, truly amazing acting. Just finished the movie a few minutes ago and loved it. If you liked this go read some Murakami I saw this film at a festival like 6 months ago and I never ever would've predicted it would get a Best Picture Oscar nomination lmao. The last hour had the most powerful and resonant scenes from last year. ",1
805,The scene where Kafuku admitted that he misses his wife but still resents her for everything hits a little to close to home Did anyone else find the cinematography and editing sort of low-key incredible?  ,1
806,"It’s filmed very matter of fact, but that let’s the performances of the actors come through.  Letting the emotional climaxes play out in two stationary long takes made them so much more powerful. ",1
807,"Then, the editing is not showy at all, but what they choose really has power (e.g. a quick reveal of the driver looking at the director in the rear view mirror). This is a perfectly paced 3 hour movie. Playing the opening credits 40 minutes in? ",1
808,"*Chef's kiss* Truthfully, it deserves Best Adapted Screenplay over the rest of the field. And this is coming from someone who thought The Power of the Dog and The Lost Daughter were outstanding. Life as a performance, life as a puzzle, life as a series of unknown roads that we must travel across, trying to understand even the tiniest part of ourselves. The film shows us that maybe only through others we can find and answer, some comfort, in our shared experience of uncertainty and grief, guilt and heartbreak;  we may find the answers to the questions that puzzle us…beautiful movie.",1
809,"The shot with the cigarettes out of the sunroof is just perfect. Takatuski was popping off some fantastic fits Beautifully shot, absolutely gorgeous. The run time felt it's length. Love the message of the people who were important in our lives aren't good people by any means but they were important and it's ok to miss them. ",1
810,But the only part I was confused with was. Why was Watari in Korea with Yusuke's car and Lee's dog? felt like I was reading a really good novel Read the short story after the movie and was surprised that the wife having her creative process during sex wasn't written by Murakami The scene in the car where the guy who was going to play Vanya was retelling the story told to him by Oto...haunting and eerie. Haunting and eerie man. Hell yes I’ve been waiting for this thread! ,1
811,"Wow, what a movie. So much to unpack—on grief, the creative process, acceptance. I was really blown away by this one. It really is epic in scale, when you consider the sheer amount the film tries to tackle. ",1
812,"What really keeps the whole thing together is Hidetoshi Nishijima’s performance. He’s absolutely marvelous. A really quiet, understated, but intense performance. I really loved what he was up to especially in the car scenes.",1
813,"Last note: I so appreciated the big dick move of dropping the credits 40 minutes in, after SOOO much has already happened. It’s always so refreshing to see a filmmaker with such confidence and skill. Can’t wait to revisit this on streaming when I have another spare 3 hours hahahahah.",1
814,Edit: grammar I saw this a few weeks ago and it's easily the best film I've seen so far this year. It would absolutely be in the top three films of 2021.,1
815,The script is incredible. I read the short story it was based on when the anthology came out and it left little impression on me but this film manages to flesh it out so well. And it's such a wonderful acting showcase. Takatsuki's monologue in the car might be the single best piece of acting I've seen all year. I'm really glad I caught this one in a cinema where I could just sit and allow the narrative to watch over me instead of pausing and getting up to get something or check my phone like I often do at home. And I barely felt the length. I was just along for the ride. I really loved the Korean couple. The scene with the two actresses in the park is also a highlight. So moving and emotional. ,1
816,"I will say that I found the cathartic scene at the house to be the only stumble for me. After being quite spare and understated, the dialogue suddenly becomes very heavy-handed in a way that I found clunky and unnecessary and the acting doesn't quite carry it off either. But outside of that, it's pretty much perfect. [removed] [SPOILER ALERT]",1
817,"I watched it a couple times, most recently at home where I had time to stop it and discuss it with my partner (who happens to be Japanese). I also read the short story. There are many interesting parallels, symmetries, and symbolic relationships hiding in plain sight.",1
818,"It seems to me that Tatatsuki is symbolic of an emotional part of Kafuku that Kafuku has repressed in himself. Note that while Kafuku controls his own anger to the point of total suppression, Tatatsuki is completely unable to control his temper, to the point where he kills another man for simply taking pictures of him.  After Tatatsuki's final speech to Kafuku in the car, there is a shot of Tatatsuki receding into the distance as Kafuku's car drives away. I think it is symbolic of Kafuku finally coming to the realization that he must look inside himself (as Tatatsuki advised him to do) and face his own anger.",1
819,"After that, we only see Tatatsuki one more time -- when he is arrested after he plays the shooting scene in Uncle Vanya -- and then Kafuku and Misaki drive to Hokkaido, where they finally allow their trauma and anger to come to the surface.  Once they acknowledge their trauma, they can move on.  Kafuku is able to play Uncle Vanya again, and Misaki is able to move on with her life (which apparently involves moving to Korea and getting a dog).",1
820,"Note that while Oto's disembodied voice reads Sonya's part in the car, it is the voiceless Yoon-a who plays Sonya in the play.  There is a very powerful dialectical relationship between words and emotions throughout the entire film, and this is one of the central themes, I believe.  This is somewhat self-evident in Kafuku's approach to Uncle Vanya, in which he forces the actors to learn the lines first and only then allow the emotions to come out of them. And yet some of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the movie come from the only character who never uses words at all (Yoon-a obviously).",1
821,"Another parallel is found between Oto and the former-lamprey girl in her story.  Oto apparently needed to confess her infidelity, just like the girl needed to confess to the security camera about killing the burglar.  Like the girl in the house who was never seen or known by Yamaga, Oto felt unseen by Kafuku, and her taking lovers into their home, where Kafuku would see them, was on some level a desire to stoke his anger -- a way to force him to acknowledge her presence in his heart. But of course he refused to do so, to the point where he could not even come home the evening she died. His subsequent anger, guilt, grief, and loss of resolution is obviously the central conflict of the film, and the arc is the sequence of events by which he finally comes to terms with all of it.",1
822,"Another parallel:  Oto's story-telling moments come from a state of dissociative identity, quite possibly; not unlike the ""Sachi"" identity that emerges from Misaki's mother. Both identities are a source of comfort/bonding for Kafuku/Misaki.",1
823,"And finally, there are the obvious parallels between the scenes from Uncle Vanya and the events of the film.  I don't know much about Uncle Vanya, but the scenes depicted in the film are obviously relevant.  The reference to ""fidelity is a lie"" is obviously what causes Kafuku to suffer a momentary breakdown -- the only time in the film when his emotions get the better of him, at least until the moment of resolution at the location of Misaki's house when he finally lets it all come to the surface. And the acceptance that they can never go back, but are ""doomed"" in some sense to endure this pain, just as the characters of the play are forced to endure their misery until they die and face God.",1
824,"There is the stone-faced couple (particularly the woman, whose name I could not discern, but whose version of a stone face is eminently kind while bizarrely emotionless) who informs Kafuku of the rules and conditions under which he must direct the play:  These are the actors you can choose from; you must have a driver; you have two days to decide whether to cancel the play.  They are like God setting the rules by which he must live, no matter how difficult or uncomfortable this existence is.  Redemption will only come once the play is complete (or you have died and presented God with your misery, in the final lines of the play). Ryusuke Hamaguchi is a modern master I enjoyed it but I am a little disappointed that I didn't feel anything during that climactic snow scene. Ultimately the  three hour runtime doesn't feel earned. The payoff is quite lackluster",1
825,"They could have easily cut down the first act and all the play rehearsals By far my favorite movie of 2021. It’s not for everyone, but in terms of my personal taste, it’s like Hamaguchi took notes on everything I love about East Asian slow burn dramas and condensed it into one perfect film. Yoona’s last scene on stage with Kafuku gets me every time. I watched this back in December in a theater, very grateful for that. But I felt like something was missing for me at the time. Technically perfect, brilliantly acted, and yet something about it felt hollow to me at the time and I didn't connect to the characters. ",1
826,"However, as my friend told me later on, apparently the part where a poor old man accidentally turned on his phone flashlight and distracted me was during the part where the younger man talks about what he loved about his departed wife, and was arguably the most emotional and personal scene of the movie. So maybe that's why it didn't connect fully on first watch. I look forward to a rewatch. ""Drove My Car"" I'm crying. Best Picture nominated film but even the Reddit mods can't get it right. I saw it a couple weeks ago, it was my first time back in the theater since they reopened where I live. I went back to the independent cinema I always go to in my city and I was so excited to see this movie. I didn’t feel like the three hour running time was too heavy. I’m a big fan of Murakami and I felt just the same way watching this movie as when I read his novels or short stories, it captured the same atmosphere and I loved it. The cinematography was beautiful, the long driving shots were gorgeously filmed. Hidetoshi Nishijima’s performance is stunning. I loved the inclusion of multiple languages in the play, and how it flowed so nicely. It’s a beautiful story about art, and grief, and going on with your life even when it’s hard and it spoke a lot to me. One of my favorite movies of the year so far. I love this movie, there was such a great use of silence in the entire movie where powerful scenes were done so subtly and the weight of each moment can be felt so well.",1
827,"There were so many great genuine moments and Ryusuke Hamaguchi is a genius in making characters feel so real. The dinner chat was really comfy, the car rides were great and I love the small moments of progression like Kafuku slowly warms up to the driver seen from him moving seats eventually as well as how he slowly reveals more and more about the past.",1
828,"My favourite scene has to be how powerful the scene after the actor leaves the car in the big reveal. Usually, there would be some big breakdown or outburst but there was this understanding between Misaki and Kafuku in the car - simply letting go and understanding they both have gone through a lot in the past.",1
829,"Hidetoshi Nishijima deserves a best actor nod, he sold his whole character so well as well as a lot of the other cast members.",1
830,"After watching this movie, I watched Hamaguchi's other film, Asako I and II and that was was pretty decent as well and I can sense his recurring theme of really knowing how to make genuine character interactions.",1
831,"I don't remember exactly what Jamie Lee Curtis said, but she mentioned early on how every daughter and father have their own game to communicate with each other, i guess for her it was invisible ink revealed by heat “🍩in a 🍩inside another 🍩” At the end when Daniel Craig was putting everything together I noticed that the knives behind the chair made a donut! And when he was explaining everything and sitting in the chair, his head perfectly filled the donut hole! I need to see it again but I think that when they were first interviewing people they never showed a camera angle where the person sitting in the chairs head filled the middle of the donut! The attention to detail in this movie was insane. Ana de Armas is definitely my favorite Ecuadorian, Paraguayan, Uruguayan, Brazilian actress.",0
832,"Edit: spelling ""She already ate the whole smoked salmon platter"" or whatever the line was absolutely killed me. Love unexpected old people jokes The best part of the movie is probably the end of the car chase when Marta gets away just by the skin of her teeth and the police cars have seemingly been trapped by debris or other things, and then we spend what feels like a full damn minute in the car with Marta and Ransom talking, and I’m thinking “Hurry! This is ridiculous if the cops don’t catch up!” and right as I’m thinking that, Blanc knocks on the car window with the rest of the fuzz pulling up behind him. So great I could listen to Daniel Craig talk about donuts and donut holes forever. The first time he said it, I laughed at how dumb it was. But he brought it back and it kept getting better. I really want a new series of murder mystery films with Daniel Craig’s character. He’s like the new, Southern Poirot. Was anyone else expecting a twist where Harlan would have been behind everything, orchestrating an elaborate suicide disguised as a murder, so as to leave one last mystery as his legacy? I called the medicine twist fairly early, but I honestly considered that he may have switched the bottles himself when he knocked the game board on the floor. Possibly as a test to see if Marta was as honest and trustworthy as he believed.",0
833,"Thankfully, what we got was much better than any half ass twist I could come up with. my favorite running joke in the movie is how all the technology at Harlan’s House was extremely outdated. lmao he’s still rocking the ThinkPad with Windows XP, and the security cameras are all from the 80’s recording on 30 year old VHS tapes that cause the VCR to smoke",0
834,">”this security footage looks like a Japanese horror movie.. am I going to die in 7 days?” The whole Hugh/you revelation seemed like something out of Danganronpa. Loved how at the end she was standing above them all with the My House, My Rules cup. Briefly glimpsed The New Yorker on Ransom's coffee table during the scene in his house - great foreshadowing. Of all the funny lines the one that really got me for some reason was when Walt asked ""Like OJ Simpson?"" “I read a tweet about a New Yorker article about you” might be one of my favorite lines. The scene where Walt is trying to manipulate Marta to give up the money by trying to make her scared of her mother being deported, and her then turning it around on him and saying, ""But you don't have any resources. I have all the resources. So I can use them to hire the fancy lawyers myself.""",0
835,*chef's kiss* My thoughts:,0
836,* Marta is a great main character. The quirk of her vomiting if she tells a lie is a great obstacle to throw at her and it does a good job of informing her character. My one issue with her character is that I wished we had spent more time with her family to give me some connection to them.,0
837,"* The twist that Marta was the one who “murdered” Harlan would have been fantastic on it’s own, but combined with the twist that Ransom sabotaged her made me like it even more. I stopped considering the movie to be a murder mystery so I stopped speculating about the circumstances surrounding Harlan’s death and didn't think about how suspicious Ransom was. ",0
838,"* I loved Thormberry family. The little interactions that reveal that they don’t actually care about Marta (not knowing what country she is from, all of them saying they wanted her at the funeral but that they got outvoted, Don handing her a plate that he was done with to take away) were perfect and I like the fact that their political affiliations didn’t stop them from being awful. Like Meg, who is the pinnacle of the ultra liberal Trump hating college student, is willing to blackmail her friend with getting her mom deported once her personal situation is threatened. I feel like Jacob was underutilized, but I think that with a cast this big someone was bound to get the short end of the stick. ",0
839,"* Daniel Craig was fantastic, mostly because of his absolutely ridiculous accent.",0
840,"* The humor was fantastic. The donut analogy and Ransom stabbing Marta with the fake knife, pulling it out and then slowly pushing it into her again were particularly hilarious gags that had the entire audience laughing their ass off, but even the minor gags like Blanc getting jumpscared by the grandma staring out the window were great as well. When Ransom and Marta are driving away ",0
841,">Ransom -  ""This may be the best thing that's ever happened to ALL of you!""",0
842,">Richard - ""What did he mean by that?",0
843,"That fucking killed me holy shit. Jesus that car chase was so great and the way it ended was hilarious. Loved that Ransom calls her Baby driver I knew something was up with Chris Evans as soon as we first see him, because the dogs start barking at him. I mean obviously he's fishy but I knew there was always going to be another twist involving him. Earlier in the movie they mention that the dogs don't bark at Marta because they like/know her, and they don't bark at pretty much anyone else in the family. We hear dogs barking at one point on the night of the murder, and Blanc says at one point that dogs are a good judge of character. I know this is all super obvious stuff but... Yeah. I didn't call the twists, but I wasn't surprised when he ended up being the true villain. I will pay almost any price to see Daniel Craig doing a ridiculous accent and monologuing. DO YOU WANT DINNER NANA",0
844,"DINNER? TO EAT? The theme of ‘building something from the ground up’ and the parallel American obsession with ‘old money’ (‘our birthright’) was so deftly done. They all profess to having achieved their success through their own grit but when the inheritance is yanked away they panic. It was also perfectly wrapped up by Blanc revealing that the ‘ancestral home’ was in fact purchased in the 1980s from a Pakistani businessman. *""I wanted you at the funeral, I was outvoted""*",0

847,"Both Denzel and Viola Davis were amazing. I find it strange that Viola Davis was nominated for Best *Supporting* Actress for the Golden Globes. She was integral to the film and was a major lead character. Love the acting, it's really strong. Some great monologues and the first 20 minutes or so at home is when the dialogue really flies crisply between characters. Lots of baseball too for a big fan was nice.",1
848,"However, I felt like there was nothing cinematic about this whatsoever. It wasn't exactly worthy of the adaptation in that sense, in that there was no reason this couldn't just remain a play. No intermission, either, so it dragged a bit. This movie was so awkward to watch with my family. We didn't know that there were any themes of cheating in this movie before seeing it and my parents have a history with that. Also my Dad is like 50% similar to Denzels character. I really liked this movie. It doesn't really do much beyond being a play on film (in terms of cinematography) but Denzel and Viola's performances were powerful enough to carry the film.",1
849,I really like this poster for the movie: http://i.imgur.com/JiGUBum.jpg,1
850,"I love the way it DENZEL and VIOLA nearly as big as the title. After seeing the movie and looking at this poster it reminded me of a promotional flyer for a boxing match, and that kind of is a good metaphor for this movie. It's essentially Denzel and Viola acting at each other for 2 hours in a house. But it's absolutely stellar and compelling acting. The ""What law says I have to like you"" and ""I was standing with you"" monologues literally gave me chills. Highly recommend this film to anyone that appreciates good acting or finely crafted stories. Denzel and Viola put on an acting clinic with this movie.  I watched it today with my family. It is an amazing and powerful movie - I felt it all the way down in my soul. Now I want to read August Wilson's other plays. ",1
851,"Denzel's character reminded me on my great uncles, grandpa, and other older black men in my family who lived in that era where the burdens of race, hatred, and poverty weighed down on them. ",1
852,I come from a family of sharecropper's in the Deep South and related to the themes of this movie based on the stories my dad and grandparents would tell me.,1
853,"I could not recommend this film more!  I've scrolled through an entire page of comments and almost everyone is giving Denzel Washington and Viola Davis high praise for their performances. Some mentioning that it's cinematically uninteresting and too stagey. Not a single mention of the actual story, whether good or bad. [deleted] I agree that that was the point of the movie, but I don't agree with it. You don't need a dick Dad to become your own man. You don't need a cheating husband to give you a child. The movie excuses all these terrible things that he did and says ""Hey, he was an asshole, but at least it lead to ""good"" things, right?""",1
854,"I don't like the idea of him dying and not truly realizing the extant of how badly he hurt the people around him. The people that he ""loved"". There's the great scene with Viola Davis yelling at him, then there's the great scene of Denzel's friend basically leaving him, but we don't get that final confrontation of the Son sticking it to his Dad. Instead the Son leaves, essentially letting him win. Denzel's able to continue living his life guilt free essentially. If he's remorseful, we never really see it. Viola Davis carried that movie. Best actress worthy. Even up against Portman. I really liked how the story covered certain issues like racism and sexism in less overt ways- showing, not telling, how the harsh reality of social issues impacted every day life at that time. In particular, Rose's monologue (""I been right here with you!"") spoke not only to the sacrifice of marriage in general but actually forced the audience, like Troy, to realize that there just wasn't any consideration of a woman's dreams or desires (above and beyond marriage). You're thinking of the story, the struggle, from Troy's perspective, his lament of his great unfulfilled potential as a result of poverty and marginalization until you're forced to see that, even though Rose bears the same burdens, her personal tragedy isn't as obvious because a woman's potential was simply not considered or valued. I think that Rose's enduring commitment and love made her a living reminder of Troy's 'soft' side and the primary reason that his children could forgive his flaws/failings.   I don't know how to say this tactfully, but are not many people in here familiar with plays? its was an amazing film! so perfect, but why add the last five minutes!?  This film was terrific. Personally, I would give it a 9.7 out of 10. Coming from a broken family that descends from broken families, this film resonated deep within me. The symbolism in the movie echoed with this sense of brokenness and yet wholeness from the father, Denzel.",1
855,"For my own relationship with my father, I understand the fence that Denzel put up, it was a barrier. My father put up fences between himself and his children, yet instilling them with the best parts of him in the end, just like Viola Davis had said about Denzel.",1
856,"Sure there were some rough parts, being an adaptation from the stage, but the quality brought out by all the actors in the movie were phenomenal and deserve praise. Overall a very solid film and one I won't soon forget. Viola Davis gave the most emotionally devastating monologue I've ever heard. She is guaranteed Best Supporting Actress. Just saw it. My audience apparently didn't understand that it's not a comedy. So many amazing moments destroyed by obnoxious laughter. I'm fucking pissed. I could describe my experience watching this film but my big issue with it is this: Do you have to know before hand that the movie is an adaptation from a play? I mean, so you don't surprise yourself with almost two hours of pure dialog and little visual montage, editing or something that differs from a theatre act without the public.",1
857,"I really liked the acting though, there is nothing to be said there but most of the movie experience is absent. Was absolutely loving the movie until the end. Denzel's character essentially learns nothing, and then at the end they look up to Heaven, lovingly thinking about him? Bull. Shit. [deleted] The acting is amazing in this, but it really feels like a play they decided to film. Which I'm fine with, but all I could think was ""this would be so much better in live theater"" I loved the movie but the audience reaction in my theater completely ruined it for me.",1
858,"I swear, for some people in my theater, this was the funniest movie they had ever seen. Just hysterical laughing throughout. I cannot understand it. Lots of sad scenes ruined by it. Haven't watched it yet, but it's interesting how negative the /r/movie poll is compared to RT and MC. Saw this last night and thought it was phenomenal. Hooked from the very beginning - the rapid fire dialogue between Trey and Bono, the '50s feel of the photography. Loved the way it retained the feeling of a stage production but still managed to break free a bit from theatre restraints and feel relatively cinematic.  Amazing performances throughout, Denzel and Davis are a given, but was also really impressed by Williamson's work. Great film.  You can tell Denzel directed this movie, cause it's not much more than Denzel talking.  This movie hit me hard. I have never seen the play so I didn't know what to expect. I didn't know to expect seeingy own father again. This was some powerful stuff.",1
859,"Well, I thought it was one of the funniest movies I've seen in awhile. Granted the first half was better than the rest. Absolute stupidity at every turn and I loved most of TJ Miller's lines. It's just what it said on the trailer. ""Rape *and* incest? That is dark!"" Karan Soni seems to be in a lot of stuff this year. This, Ghostbusters, and Deadpool. He also showed up in Goosebumps...where the hell did this guy come from? it was really funny. Michael made everyone switch presents when he got a crummy handmade oven mitt When a movie makes you cringe hard enough that you have your head in your hands, it's not a good sign.",0
860,"It's dumb fun that delivers one of those promises: being incredibly dumb. The entire film felt like a giant commercial with memes and David Bowie jokes thrown into the mix. It rehashes pretty much every joke in the ""R-rated party movie"" book, it reeks of corporate advertising (do NOT get me started on the Cinnabon or Kia Minivan ""jokes""), and with most of the jokes being about Tinder, 3D printing your own cock and balls, Snapchat, being PC, Grumpy Cat, Fast and the Furious references and the early seasons of Degrassi: The Next Generation, it's destined to age horribly.",0
861,"Almost forgot: When Aniston's character is leaving the VIP lounge, she's got a copy of The Girl on the Train. Seems to me like Amblin Partners needed some cross-promotion to boost revenue... Hey comedy directors, physical comedy is not funny if it's obviously bad CGI.  ""Canadian Television Theory with a concentration on Drake"" was my biggest laugh. Other than that, it was decently funny. Pretty safe R rated comedy but I don't regret it. My biggest problem though is all the current pop culture references it kept making that will age it like cheese in 10 years. T.J Miller and Jason Bateman are just likeable af  I liked it. Fight me /r/movies  T.J. Miller was the heart and soul of the film, everything else was the quintessential definition of meh. I know people are gonna be like, ""It's dumb, but just like turn your brain off"". But wouldn't it be better if it wasn't so unbelievably dumb? Like no one says ""the food is bad, but you can eat it if you hold your nose shut"". Like the movie is so actively dumb it takes me out of it, and not in a way were the dumbness is the joke ala Jackass, it's just noise to fill a few empty hours of the day. I love Jason Bateman. I love Rob Corddry. I did not love this. ""here's a wild Christmas party. throw in a bunch of comedy actors and let them say lines. make a few sex and drug references, that should be enough""  ",0
862,"the scene that defines this movie for me is when jason bateman and olivia munn get trapped on the roof. nothing happens, they go up there to smoke a joint, are locked and then.... nothing. there is no escalation of their attempts to get untrapped, there is nothing happening that they are desperately missing while stuck, the situation does not get worse and worse, they are just like, ""darn, we are stuck here now"". no comedic tension is built. they sit there, have a serious talk a bit, but nothing to get truly invested in either a comedic or in a non comedic sense, and then are almost immediately let back into the building by a guy opening the door to pee.  ",0
863,"still a few highlights, i especially liked tj miller, jennifer aniston and kate mckinnon's characters. too bad they don't have much to do except what you already expect them to do.  I got exactly what I expected: a few good laughs and no actual plot. I don't need to rewatch the film, or own it, but I didn't feel like it was money wasted.",0
864,"But then again I don't get angry about product placements, or references like it seems this sub does at times. ""Holy shit they said Cinnabon, guess this movie bows down to their corporate sticky bun masters!"" The ending felt a bit deus ex machina. ""This revolutionary gadget comes in at the last second to save the day!"" You could also see the climax scene coming from a mile away, but I liked the movie! Even though it does have a 5.7/10 on imdb and it is a bit cheesy it was a pretty funny flick.  With a title like ""Office Christmas Party,"" I wouldn't expect much. Kate McKinnon's had a terrible movie career so far. She's like the new Dana Carvey. I guess wait for this one on Netflix?  This is one of those strange movies. Designed by committee to cash in on Christmas time and product placement. It's not even really designed to be watched by anybody. It's just mindless noise.",0
865,This is a movie sixteen year olds go to in order to get away from their parents and fingerbang in the back. Or to have on in the background of a party. Or put on by some frat boy when he's trying to get up in them guts.,0

You will never think about this movie ever again once the credits roll because nothing actually feels like it has an impact. :(  ""Why is that car on fire? Did the Bears win?""",0
867,"That was the only genuine laugh this film got out of me. Such a talented cast wasted on a piss poor script. As much as I love going to the movies to watch some low-brow comedy to pass the time, this is just a noisy bore. I damn near forgot I had even seen it until I saw this Official Discussion post. If you truly have nothing better to do, I suggest getting through that Netflix queue you've built up for yourself that you've been meaning to watch instead of this.",0
868,lol wtf is that synopsis  What was up with the infection? The blood is converted into a nectar-like substance and the infected wants to bury its head like an ostrich (said it's a hibernating).  ,0
869,"Good movie but lots of questions about the world building which is fascinating more than confusing. Seen it last night and enjoyed it a lot. After reading World War Z (my favorite of all time) I now treat each zombie movie as an extended chapter in that universe. This movie showed me how people in Australia survived the outbreak. Train to Busan is how the Koreans survived the outbreak. I thought it was fascinating to see how different parts of the world deals with the outbreak. When Andy looks back at the door on the yacht and sees it open a crack... Haunting. \*That's\* how suspense is done. That was a really great moment for me. I don't know if it's just because I have a small daughter, but when he is kissing his daughter good bye and telling her he loves her and she kisses him back, it destroyed me. Overall it was an ok movie. Some of the scenes were macabre, and great for a zombie film. Too bad that a lot of the decisions by the main character were just dumb. I know emotions can lead to irrational things, but there should be some limits like: ",0

873,"](#spoiler) Two hours ago I didn’t know this movie existed. Now I’m sitting here fucking devastated. Did not realize this subreddit was filled with so many professional film critics, directors, writers, actors, producers etc. Commenting on how terrible it was yet not giving any actual reasons. It had great performances, beautiful setting and was different enough as to not get bored. Better than 90% of the stuff on Netflix. I wanted to actually chat about the movie rather than read people bitching. This movie seemed to be trying really hard to ruin apricot jelly for me. How dare they?  This is what zombie media such as 'The Walking Dead' should be like. Limited supplies and a strong survival aspect, true stakes, characters we actually care about and feel real (not indestructible), zombies taking a backseat to focus on character building.",0
874,"It's by no means a perfect film, some story elements seem a bit contrived. But it sparked a bit of originality and life into a sub-genre that is moribund. This movie was okay, but that scene where Vics wife jumps out in front of the bullet was so fucking forced and stupid. If you havent checked it out this is based on an awesome [short film](https://youtu.be/gryenlQKTbE).  It was SUCH a movie! God that perfume, hand holding, and quiet nod at the end was so beautiful. When the movie started with a cliche helicopter nature shot I was worried about the upcoming cinematography, but I'm pleased to admit that I was absolutely wrong.  Wait, Andy’s last name is Rose? So his daughter’s name is Rosie Rose? That’s really tacky. While there were some cliche elements, I really enjoyed it. Would definitely recommend it (great 1st track for the credits as well). Fuck. Even though I'm not a father, yet, this film produced a few tears by the end.  I thought it was decent. Martin Freeman completely carries this film. Both him and the cinematography made it watchable for me.  I liked everything but the Vic parts. Expanded from the short, which is quite a powerful film in itself.  It's a sad, melancholic film with a very dark undercurrent.  Freeman is great in it, as he usually is.  It's a character drama using the zombie idea.  I really enjoyed it, well worth a watch.  You've got nothing to do today...put it on!! :-) I really enjoyed this movie. ",0
875,"SO many creative ideas for the zombie genre. Such as calling them diggers and ghosts, seeing them with their heads underground, the fluid that secretes over the eyes and mouth and infected areas of the body. The “48 hour” concept was done well.",0
876, I’m glad they never fully explained certain things - like what exactly happened to the world? Was it certain countries or the majority- they explain briefly that India wasn’t diseased as opposed to Australia. Why the diggers would keep their heads underneath? They mention the hibernation but it’s still interesting.,0
877,Certain set pieces also like when they come in contact with the family he sees previously on the river in the beginning of the film. ,0
878,"Martin Freeman does an excellent job and so does Simone Landers who played Thoomi.  I can't help but feel there's a ""Noble Savage"" sentiment in Cargo. Apparently modern society has collapsed, and everybody is fleeing and getting picked off one by one by the zombie outbreak, except... the Aborigines who reverted to their ""old ways"" and are apparently doing better than anyone else that we know of. ",0
879,"I just don't know what the movie wants me to do with this. What am I supposed to understand about Aborigine culture now? That they are good at surviving? That they have some sort of wisdom that is lost to the modern world? Whatever it was, the movie didn't convey it well. I remember watching a short film on YouTube many, many years ago. Is this the result? Fucker was about to kill a baby just to get him back Does anyone know the name of the song that plays when the ending credits start rolling?",0
880,"Chadwick's performance is unforgettable. Viola is good too but Chadwick steals the show. I know Chadwick Boseman's undeniably superb performance will get the most interest due his tragic passing but holy hell, Viola Davis is really one of the beat actresses of all time. The physicality she brings to the role was something only a masterclass actor could pull off. The performances are truly great but the film itself was just okay. What works as a stage play doesn't necessarily translate to film. The film needed a better screenwriter who could adapt the play for the screen. It's still worth watching just for the performances though. Levee was an ambitious man who told people he was in complete control but really had no say or control other than what he says. When he didn't get what he wanted at the end he displaced all those negative feelings on to someone else, with terrible results. I feel for the guy and have met guys like that growing up. There’s nothing I can say about Viola or Chadwick that hasn’t already been said. So instead, I’ll say this: this year Colman Domingo has easily cemented himself as one of my favorites in Hollywood, to the point where I’ll see something without knowing anything about it simply because Colman is in it. Somewhat random and unrelated, but last year, Netflix released a documentary mini series following Kevin Hart and the fallout from his anti-LGBTQ comments and subsequent bowing out from hosting the Oscars.",0
881,"One episode covered Hart's production company, wherein he pitched to Chadwick Boseman his idea for a movie. I can't recall the details, but I do remember Hart making a big deal out of it and figuring it was a ""sure thing"" that Boseman would star in his bullshit movie.",0
882,"During the pitch meeting, Boseman turned Hart down, basically saying he's careful about the roles he chooses and the impact they may have. At the time, I didn't think much about his reasoning for declining the part. Knowing now that he was battling terminal cancer when he met with Hart however, puts that segment from the episode into an entirely new light.",0
883,"Boseman didn't want to be remembered for quick payday roles in stupid lowest common denominator comedies, like Hart. His decision to play Levee in *Ma Rainey's Black Bottom* makes so much sense now, as this will be one of the roles for which he will be forever remembered. Deservedly so. So, what are y'all thinking about the end where Levee kills Toledo? I was interpreting it as the yellow shoes being symbolic of his optimism for the future and his come up, and Toledo's clodhoppers are Black folks' past, stepping all over and messing up his dreams. Something about Chadwick Boseman's final role involving him talking about his ambitions and how bright his future is going to be just feels like one more punch to the gut. I didn't find the narrative particularly interesting but the performances are absolutely outstanding. It makes sense, I suppose, being based on a play that it's very much a performance heavy film.",0
884,"I kind of felt that the ending (with Toledo's death) came out of nowhere but I understand the point that the film/play is trying to make. Despite all his talk, Levee is deeply traumatized by what happened to his parents and to him and he is walking around with all this rage and anger trying to turn it into something. He tries at first to channel it into his music and he is talented but he's stymied by the opportunities he can get (also I totally assumed that Mr. Irvin was stealing his songs to give them to another band - I was shocked he even offered to pay for them at the end. After all, why take the songs if you aren't planning to use them?). Some of Levee's problems are of his own making, of course, he's obnoxious, he's rude and he's combative and that certainly doesn't help you get any further in life and he throws away a good opportunity with Ma Rainey's band because he doesn't want to just follow the rules. Anyway in the end, I thought at first that he would stab Mr. Irvin because of Chekov's knife and all but instead he turns that violence onto an innocent person, someone who is just as oppressed as he is, someone who has shown him nothing but kindness for the most part - in part, because he knows from his father's experience, that he could never kill a white man and get away with it (not that Irvin deserved to die for stealing someone's music). It's a very heavy ending. ",0
885,"I find that this era of American plays tend to deal heavily with the casualties of the American Dream. You're sold a bill of goods but they'll never come through for you and you spend your whole life chasing a phantom. I think those messages are still relevant, if not more so now, than they were when they were written. Boseman delivered a knockout in his last role. People might say that he gets the oscar because of his passing, but i truly believe he is earning it with this (and also the fact that the year seems weaker in general for awards) I just want to say that I don't think he really stepped on his shoes.... He couldn't fight the person who had really stepped on him... I'm surprised to find comments that the movie was slow or boring. Throughout the movie I was smitten by the amazing performances as well as the colorful personalities and perspectives of the characters. Their conversations and storytelling really laid it all out for us - each band member's life, beliefs, worries, traumas. One hour into the movie I was feeling for everyone in the band, even for the ambitious and erratic Levee. But it was really Ma Rainey who tied it all together at the end.",0
886,"I could not help think ""God, Ma Rainey is being really difficult."" She came to the studio late, brought her stuttering nephew to take even more time recording, and threatened multiple times she won't record until everything is done her way.  I mean, I thought I knew why -- the music industry was brutal, especially for black musicians whose talents were appropriated shamelessly. As Ma Rainey puts it, they only want her voice.  But for me the real chills came with the scene where those white musicians were playing the song that Sturdyvant swindled from Levee for mere $5. Then Ma Rainey sitting in the backseat of her car looked straight back at the viewers, like she's saying ""see? I told you so."" That's gotta be my favorite scene, it was so poignant and heartbreaking. I watched the film last night but I'm still thinking about it.",0
887,"What I'm still curious about is, what purpose do the characters Dussie Mae and Sylvester play? What does the writer (of the play & film) want to say through those two? Still haven't figured that out. Get Chadwick his Oscar NOW! Goddamnit that scene of him questioning God when we know that he was battling terminal cancer just crushed me. It’s a tragedy that he’s gone, but his last film is his best work ever. Wow. A one, a. two, a you know what to do.... So, I had the great pleasure of working on this film, and finally got to watch the end result.",0
888,"Story wise, I think this works better as a live theater experience. However, I had the great pleasure of sitting in on a few meetings with the director and thinking back to him explaining his vision, I think he did a masterful job in pulling out the performances he got from Boseman and Davis. They are unbelievable.",0
889,"Overall, a great story and very beautifully executed. Very proud to have been a part of this production in my capacity. I can only imagine how incredible this must be performed live. I’m going to miss you Chadwick I enjoyed learning about [August Wilson's cycle of ten plays](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Wilson#The_Pittsburgh_Cycle), each based on the African American experience in a different decade of the 20th century. This film is the one from the 20s, of course. It's the only one set in a location other than the playwright's native Pittsburgh.",0
890,"The other play from this cycle that's been made into a movie is Fences, which I'm curious about now. Denzel Washington supposedly has plans to produce more. This movie feels like it was supposed to be longer. I thoroughly enjoyed this and am slightly appalled by some of the critiques I’ve seen",0
891,"While it has largely been received well by critics and audiences alike, the negative reviews have condemned it as far too boring which I can’t agree with at all",0
892,"The dialogue may have given the impression of rambling at times, more specially when the band members are interacting with each other, but each word uttered is reflective of the characters and their respective mindsets",0
893,"Chadwick and Davis were exceptional of course, and I don’t see how one could view his performance with anything other than admiration and applause",0
894,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, perhaps more than I should? Maybe it comes down to me being seventeen and lacking a desire for further nuance in some aspects of the film but this was a great film with dynamic characters that highlighted aspects of Black film that aren’t frequently covered. Levee rejecting god is incredibly impactful because he’s a Black man and his reasons for doing so are unique at least based on the other films I’ve seen that try to highlight historical issues within the Black community. ",0
895,"Some were also complaining about Ma’s personality and saying that she was too cruel or egotistical when she directly states why she treats the people around her like she does. The treatment of Black people in the music industry is still horrendous to this day, and you can see her message of them not caring about anything other than the money that comes with her voice and music become more blatant towards the end with Levee being told initially that he could record his songs then being told that they weren’t good enough only for them to be played by a White band (only further reflecting the ways in which Black inventions and art have been stolen).",0
896,"Overall I really enjoyed this film, it’s an 8/10 for me undoubtedly. I actually would’ve liked it to be longer if anything. God DAMN Viola was captivating in this! Completely became Ma Rainey. And Boseman! God it was sad seeing him act his ass off in his last role ever :,(",0
897,"I thought the superficial “green screen” look to everything kinda hindered the film but man were those performances amazing. The performances are excellent - especially Davis and  Boseman. I went into this cold and was mesmerized from start to finish. It’s a shame this is the last we’ll see of Boseman, he’s cocky, energetic, passionate, scary. The adaptation from stage to screen was not all that successful to me. That being said, Viola Davis was amazing. There was a physicality to her performance that transcended those stage limitations. The way she walked with her hip out, all plastered in makeup and sweat—commanding stuff. She was big when she needed to be, but other times sage-like or seductive. Really well-rounded performance. Contrary to many of the other comments, I felt it translated from stage to screen well.  The story is set in a recording studio, so finding ways to translate chunks of dialog to other settings would have been less realistic.  Viola Davis was so believable as Rainey and confident enough in her acting to look all sweaty and such.  The rest of the cast was great, too.",0
898,"I saw a local production of Wilson’s Jitney a couple years ago and I hope Washington/Netflix do it soon.  It has a similar rhythm to the dialog and interplay between the characters Loved the scene when Sylvestre finally makes it and starts to dance proudly. For me personally the movie didn't settle well with me. I have not seen the play, but it makes sense that the way this story is told, it's better as a play. ",0
899,"That being said Viola and Chadwick were thunderous in their acting prowess. Anyone interested in music, film, and Chadwick Boseman should watch ""Get On Up"" about the life story of James Brown.  Chadwick Boseman was phenomenal in that as he was in ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"" but ""Get on Up"" is a movie while MRBB is essentially a play that is filmed.",0
900,"not joking, directly after this movie i went home and made myself a mushroom omelet Take a bow, Johnny Greenwood. Fantastic score (and film overall).  The scene where he goes to find her at the ball is one of my favorite shots of 2017 , he looks so dark and miserable and everything else is so vibrant and happy.  Barbara disrespecting the dress and the quest to get it back was the funniest scene I saw in a movie all year. I was shocked by how funny this movie was.",1
901,"I'm seeing Call Me By Your Name tomorrow and there are still about 20 other movies from 2017 that I want to see eventually, but right now this is definitely in my top 10.  I would really like a pair of those long purple socks DDL puts on in the beginning.  Don’t we all want someone who loves us enough to dose us with poisonous mushrooms? After thinking on it, I believe that what Reynolds Woodcock truly wanted was a mother.  Alma became a contender for that role by feeding him, referring to him as her 'hungry boy'.  He criticized her appearance but said that he'd make her beautiful, or in other words shape her into the woman he wanted by putting her to the test by being a stubborn boy with behavior like his picky eating (refusing to enjoy vegetables the way she prepares them) and complaining.",1
902,"When he became sick, his mother appeared as a ghost that he longed for and reached out to, but who didn't respond.  Then Alma enters and it's when she starts tending to him and caring for him that the ghostly figure disappears.",1
903,"In the end, he got what he truly wanted, a woman who literally made him eat his vegetables (yeah, yeah I know, actually mushrooms) and care for him like the mother he longed for.",1
904,"Plus there's a whole other side to what Alma wanted.  What a movie! I remember during production there were rumors that this film was PTA's take on Fifty Shades, and those rumors definitely fueled my take. The pleasure derived from being in control. It's incredible how sensual, intimate, and even erotic, this film is without ever being explicit. Then at the same time, there is so much abuse that Alma withstands. She even takes pride in it when she discusses her ability to stand all day for him. Despite his incessant need for control and dominance, Reynold's true joy begins with his submission. Love that twist.",1
905,Best part of PTA is that there is always so much to dissect. I'm looking forward to seeing the movie again and hearing other people's takes on it. This movie was very chic  tfw no mommy GF: the movie,1
906,"4chan's gonna love this One key, I think, to understanding this film better is in the names. His name is ""Woodcock"" which is self-explanatory. Her name is Alma, which in Latin means ""nourishing"". Hence the Latin name for ones school is ""Alma Mater"" or ""Nourishing Mother"". Woodcock needs nourishment. He literally says he is ""hungry"" throughout. She calls him a ""hungry boy"", and their first meeting is when she is serving him a meal, literally ""nourishing"" him. But he wants the nourishment his way. The power play is over how she will nourish him. She wants to be his nourishment. She doesn't want his ghost mother to be the nourishment. Nor does she want the sister to be the nourishment. She must become his nourishment. I think the film plays with gender roles also. Woodcock represents the masculine role and the need for nourishment in various forms and the power of the feminine over the masculine. The sister, Alma, and the other women in the film represent the feminine the ""Alma"" or nourishment they provide symbolically. ",1
907,"Anyway. I just saw the movie and have a lot to think on after leaving it. I absolutely loved it, and I think it is the best movie made in 2017. ",1
908," ""If you want to have a staring contest with me, you will lose.""",1
909,"I think this encounter does a good job of summing up their romance; she is going to challenge Woodcock, and he looks away uncomfortably during the staring contest.",1
910,"PTA knocked it out of the park with this one visually; best framing and shot composition since Kubrick, in my opinion (the layering of the buildings in the background in the gas station scene was fantastic). And good movement as well, I love the 360 degree shot as a bunch of the ladies of House Woodcock stand around a table.",1
911,"If anyone knows any specifics on how PTA came to take on such a big role with the camera work, could they let me know? For instance, did he have anyone attached as D. of Photography and that just fell through or something? I can’t believe no one has mentioned it yet, but that scene where he hallucinates his mother freaked me the *fuck* out.",1
912,"I was legit unnerved during that entire sequence in his bedroom, I was convinced there was gonna be a jump scare any second. Just saw the movie and I was very impressed. I still can't get the score out of my head.",1
913,"Obviously the film is about the relationship between Woodcock and Alma, but I also thought it worked well as an allegory for the cycle of creativity. At the beginning of the story, Alma becomes Woodcock's muse and inspiration. He even mentioned to her that he's been waiting for her for a very long time. He's been waiting for somebody to come along and ignite his passion. She makes him hungry for it.",1
914,"Then eventually things become stale and his creative drive begins to dissipate. He becomes extremely frustrated/ disinterested with Alma. A lot of creative types find it difficult to produce at times in their lives when they are complacent. He was always trying to fill a hole with his work and once that hole had been filled by somebody else, his work began to suffer for it.",1
915,In his past relationships he would simply end things so that he could be alone again and keep filling that hole with his craft. Then he finds a new muse and the cycle repeats.,1
916,"When Alma decides to poison him, she allows him to purge that complacency. He is facing death and uncertainty and that hole that was filled is emptied. And Alma is there after the reset button has been pressed. He is hungry again. Rinse, lather, repeat.",1
917,"These are just thoughts that were running through my head on my drive home and I could be completely off base. Either way, fantastic movie. PTA gone and done it again I absolutely loved it. Far and away my favorite film from 2017.",1
918,"What stuck with me the most is that one shot of Alma lying on the couch, with the finished wedding dress standing next to her, and a recovered Reynolds enters the room to sit next to her. The camera slowly pans/zooms to focus on just the two of them, with the dress being slowly removed from the frame, signifying that she has become the object of his affection. Simply a tremendously subtle way to visually express his emotions and mind.",1
919,"Also, that Jonny Greenwood score is intoxicating. I bought the soundtrack as soon as it was available. Dave Chen summed up my thoughts on the film pretty well: ""[THE PHANTOM THREAD was exceptionally well made and well acted. But it depressed and disturbed me. I was not emotionally ready for the turns this movie took, even as I’m grateful this journey exists.](https://twitter.com/davechensky/status/954223420404740096)"" I'm conflicted. I loved the score, loved the performances of the three main actors/actresses, and enjoyed parts of the cinematography but something fell a little flat for me with the story that I can't quite put my finger on.   Honestly I'll be pretty disappointed if they don't get an Oscar for the music though.  I know it's almost needless to say it, but Daniel Day Lewis is absolutely amazing in this film, and should be in serious consideration for Best Actor. His haunting performance is rivaled only by Krieps' outstanding delivery. She definitely should be nominated for Best Actress, but I don't know if I necessarily think she should win over McDormand, Streep, Ronan, and Hawkins. Paul Thomas Anderson is in the business of making all-time worthy movies. I saw this for the second time yesterday and I loved it even more. Picked up on the themes and motifs in the first half a little better (i.e. just how much of the film revolves around food even moreso than clothes). Jonny Greenwood topped his There Will Be Blood score with The Master and I think he's topped it again. Remove the score and the film's atmosphere falls apart. Splendidly shot and acted either way. This is an instant classic.",1
920,"edit: I have a very very very small question I really wish I thought I asked PTA during his AMA on reddit and twitter the past couple of days. There's a New Years scene and I was just wondering.. what year is it? I know it's the 50s but if anyone knows more than me let me know. It's not important, but I can't help but be curious. This is worth seeing with an audience around you...hearing everyone's reactions as the film continues to escalate, and especially when the ending hits everyone...there was an audible gasp in my theater tonight. It would be an amazing film anywhere, but experiencing it with other people is wonderful. This, for me, is the film of the year. A complete 10.  This and Call Me By Your Name have given me two relationships that I love for such DRASTICALLY different reasons Was lucky enough to see this in 70MM several nights ago. Absolutely loved it. Also some guy in the theater got caught masturbating.  I can't imagine where Paul Thomas Anderson is going to go from here.",1
921,"He's already pulled off a three-hour epic character piece, made Adam Sandler Oscar-worthy and now two fantastic films with Daniel Day-Lewis. ",1
922,"Let's not forget also, Inherent Vice was pretty fucking unfilmable and he made a great film out of that too. ",1
923,"PTA, you got the touch. ",1
924,"**YOU GOT THE POWER!** The whole movie felt... strange. In movies usually there's some kind of driving force that advances the narrative, but I never got that feeling in Phantom Thread. The movie just kept going out of nothing. Is the movie supposed to be about power dynamics? Reynolds' obsessiveness? Alma trying to win over Reynolds? I feel like I'd need a re-viewing, but at the same time I have zero desire to ever watch this movie again.",1
925,"If the guy wasn’t good looking, this would be the most disgusting piece of trash ever. Imagine if a fat slob mafia dude was cast as Massimo. Genuinely the worst erotic film I have ever seen in my life. The dialogue is laughable and the soundtrack is unbelievably annoying. The director also fucks around with the camera way too much with endless pans.",0
926,"This film makes 50 Shades of Grey look like The Handmaiden and I am glad Roger Ebert never lived to see this film. I never thought I would see a day where a movie made 50 Shades of Grey look good, but 365 happened.",0
927,This is hands down the worst movie I have seen this year and will probably stay that way.,0
928,"The fact that this movie is making abuse, asssult, and Stockholm Syndrome look hot is fucking disgusting. That yacht scene was 😰",0
929,Terrible film and I cringe for my friend who ended up watching it with her MOTHER! the thing that annoys me the most about all the thinkpieces being written about this is how they describe the film as completely devoid of value except as masturbatory material.,0
930,"i would actually go further and argue the film isn't even worth watching in that regard. people are probably gonna check out this movie thinking it's shitty but super sexy, and end up wasting their time when they realize it's about as arousing as watching grass grow.",0
931,"aside from the sex scene on the yacht filmed with the drones, which is only notable due to the camera angles and how overlong the scene itself is, the sex scenes are nothing you haven't seen before in a Cinemax (Skinemax) show that airs after 11:30 PM. i actually found most of the passionate scenes extremely offputting given the film's propensity to frame the male and female lead as sexy bantering rivals rather than, you know, a kidnapper and his fucking kidnapping victim. I actually didn't expect anything to beat ""The Grudge"" as the worst film of 2020 but wow... this movie in a word... despicable.",0
932,"99 out of 100 times, I don't have trouble with the subject matter of a film but with ""365 Days"" there were multiple times here I audibly questioned what I was seeing on screen. It's horrible! This girl gets kidnapped and sexually assaulted for an hour and then the rest of the film she pretty much has Stockholm Syndrome. ",0
933,"The only saving graces from this film are the very few clever lines, the bad english, and honest to god, THE SOUNDTRACK! The soundtrack is ""The Room"" level bad and it makes every scene hilarious! I’m pleasantly surprised to see how few comments this thread has. It means most people’s time hasn’t been wasted in this utter steaming pile of shit. If it wasn't for Netflix, then this movie would have faded into obscurity as a *Fifty Shades* wannabe from Poland.",0
934,"Netflix is to entertainment what Facebook is to information. On a scale from 50 Shades to After, it’s straight-up softcore porn. Unpopular opinion: It was STILL a way better movie than any of the 50shades. I think the chemistry between the two is what makes it work. The dialogue needs work for sure and if they continue, they need to stray away from the book ending. It's Anna-Maria and Michele that make the chemistry so fire that people enjoy it. I won't deny they didn't do a good job of setting up the plot in the script. It was all over the place, hopefully now that netlflix is involved it gets cleaned up. (Cleaned up meaning a more organized script....lets keep the steam LOL) I highly doubt anything is going to top this film for worst movie of 2020, and that includes Artemis Fowl and The Grudge! Of cours I’m old enough to know that not all movies should be about healthy relationships and two cutie pies falling in love. And I actually love a good erotic movie (Fatal attraction? Basic Instinct? Wide closed eyes?) and would like to watch a soft porn with a good storyline. But god this movie is awful just awful story is ridiculous the acting sucks (lucky for them and the audience that the leading actors are very hot) sex scene are very hard to watch and yes it’s rape and sexual assaults and the girl is making sexy faces when she suppose to be horrified. The leading man is telling the girl in a sexy romance voice that he will not force himself into her while he is actually kidnapped her and caging her for a year!!!! this movie was described for me by a friend saying “it’s literally 50 shades of grey without the cringe” but I would say this movie is even cringer It's to appeal the people who like 50 Shades. It's trashy, but there's audience for that, specially frustrated women who are too prude to watch porn or explore their sexualities and dream to marry an abusive bad boy billionaire. It's ficiton after all, some of the elements are closer modern fairy tale, but then we remember that real life billionaires aren't the nice guys and the prince charming in the movie is an assassin from mafia. ",0
935,"**The good**: the actors were good looking and had chemistry. Also the luxury setting and sexy scenes are good to look at, the movie make itself from the visuals only. ",0
936,"**The bad**: everything else. It glorified rape, sexism, the female protagonist was vapid, the male protagonist was a criminal, the narrative structure is messy and confusing.  ",0
937,"It did the soft porn better than 50 shades, since Dakota and Jamie had zero chemistry. But the plot managed to be even a bit worse. I gave 3/10 only because of the scenarios and the sex scenes looked realistic. I just came here hoping someone would shed some light on whether these sex scenes are real.  I tend to agree with all the criticisms but was intrigued by the occasional cock shaft.  Ftr, I’ve seen news articles from the actors saying they weren’t real but I don’t buy it necessarily. this was trending in so many countries. like there's just seriously no fate left in humanity. Very disappointed with this film.  The lead actors have more chemistry than the 50 shades actors but the dialogue makes me cringe.  How can Massimo judge a man for child trafficking but he himself is guilty of kidnapping?  My favourite erotic film will still remain 9 1/2 weeks.  Mickey Rourke was the bomb! To be honest, Michele is the only reason I 've watched 365 days. 365 dayıs [removed] Lol someone wrote on Letterboxd that if the guy was ugly then this would be a horror film. Then someone else (obv jokingly said), “I tried to follow his footsteps and now I got court next week”. Lmao. Well yeah, that *is* why it’s so popular. Gratuitous male nudity is something that isn’t seen very often in mainstream movies, and this movie has a LOT of gratuitous male nudity. This movie finds every excuse to get this man shirtless/nude as often as possible while the main actress is relatively clothed. ",0
938,"It’s the only thing that this movie gets right, because *nothing else makes sense*. [deleted] > the soundtrack is unbelievably annoying.",0
939,"I found that the soundtrack made it better. It reminded me of how bad ""The Room"" soundtrack was So it's basically most Hermione/Draco fanfiction but put in movie form? I can’t imagine a worse movie to watch with your mother",0
940,"FINALLY!!!!!i have been waiting for a discussion for this film on this sub for soooooo long. i’ll echo my comment on r/truefilm on the bonfire scene, which has been steadily becoming one of my favorite scenes in movies of all time. the use of acapella to build tension. the way the scene climax when they *finally* make eye contact. héloïse’s dress catches on fire; they realize theyre in love. héloïse looks down and sees her burning dress and does nothing but accept it; accept their love despite all the implications that comes with it. she ignores how incredibly inappropriate their love was at that time and how she already knew it could only end in pain. i love it so much and how it reuses old clichés of fire = passion/love and make something that feels completely new in how well made it was. ",0
941,"theres this haunting image of héloïse in her wedding dress that appears more than once after they kiss, and not only is this as a callback to the tale of orpheus (héloïse disappears every time marianne turns around to look at her until she finally does disappear for real and their love is lost forever) but it is also a heartbreaking reminder to the both of them that they’ll never be happy even when theyre together due to the looming dread of her eventual but certain marriage. its the acknowledgement of their unhappy ending by the character herself that breaks me. ",0
942,im so fucking happy that this movie exists and really do feel like its a once-in-a-generation kind of film for me. The last scene is going to stick with me for a long time. ,0
943,"The most effective part is it's not just pure sobbing. She smiles for a moment, even as the tears pour, she's feeling every emotion as she listens and remembers. It just breaks my fucking heart, even weeks after having seen it. Man - the acapella at the bonfire spooked me when it first started. I purposely didn’t read anything before seeing the movie and I was worried that it was going to take a hard left into Midsommar/The VVitch territory. ",0
944,Phew! The complete lack of any score made every single musical moment hit hard. Damn. Loved this! When Marianne saw the painting with Héloïse's finger on that page.... I lost my shit bro. That scene with the armpit and the drugs... The cool thing about this movie is that it's a fucking masterpiece This movie be out here making me cry about a fucking page number. Like damn. Finally able to share my thoughts with a wider audience now that the discussion is live. I caught this early January.,0
945,"As a straight male, this movie resonated with me in ways unimaginable.",0
946,"I don't think its recency bias in the slightest, but as soon as the credits started to roll, wiping the flood of uncontrollable tears, I thought to myself: *""Yup. This is one of the most beautifully moving films I have ever experienced and an immediate Top 5 favorite of mine.""*",0
947,"So much is said without anything every being said; the film is its loudest, most loving, and most intelligent in its quietest moments. The scenes between Marianne and Heloise during their sessions, especially the one where Heloise questions ""And who do I look at?"" were magnetic despite being such tender, whisper-soft moments.",0
948,"There are several scenes that are still imprinted in my mind that I cannot shake, but, above all, those final 10 minutes, but more so those final 4 minutes, during the orchestra, as the music swells and we see a range of emotion play out on her face...it's unreal.",0
949,"This film was beautiful, and everyone should really do their best to experience it. >""Why doesn't she smile.""",0
950,"> ""Perhaps because you aren't funny.",0
951,>*next time Marianne and Heloise are together*,0
952,">""So do you think your sister wanted to die."" ",0
953,"Damn I need to step up my flirt game. The scene where Marianne and Heloise kind of taunt each other by informing the other of their tells is a great new example of an incredibly hot scene with no sex in it. I went into the film expecting it to primarily be about the relationship between Marianne and Héloïse, and it mostly was. But I was also pleasantly surprised how big of a part of the movie Sophie was. The abortion scene with her lying on the bed next to the little kid was utterly gripping, and I loved how much of the film was centered on the interactions between all three of them. When we were zoomed in on Heloise at the end I half expected Visions of Gideon to start playing. Like yeah queer movie where they don’t end up together but same guy punch that hurts so good Not to brag but.... Héloïse and me were doing the exact same thing as the music played at the end... I read somewhere that the director said she wanted to show consent with their first kiss. But openly asking for it wasn’t that romantic and break the flow of the scene for people. So she made them cover their mouths. Lifting the covers meant they were giving their consent. I’ll try to find the article.",0
954,Edit: I couldn't find the one I read but found these:,0
955,">“[R](https://www.advocate.com/film/2019/12/19/portrait-lady-fires-female-gaze-fight-against-convention)[egarding](https://www.advocate.com/film/2019/12/19/portrait-lady-fires-female-gaze-fight-against-convention) eroticism, it was all the eroticism of consent. The first kiss scene is shot like that. They both unveil their mouths. They're both saying yes to this, and this is new and sexy,” Sciamma says. “This is not like the usual scene. Each time somebody touched somebody, they asked.” ",0
956,&#x200B;,0
957,">[And](https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/2/19/21137213/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-celine-sciamma-interview) also, the movie is fully about consent and how consent is also super erotic and super sexy. Sophie, even though she went through this, she’s being asked what she wants. And each time they touch each other, they never touch each other without asking first. We tried to make it very mutual. I was wondering why the didn't choose to be lovers above all else and just abandon everything. The move answered this. She asked her to turn around at the end, they chose the ending of poets not lovers. I had a strong initial reaction that Celine Sciamma made a mistake with the ending. I really believed she should have cut the movie off after Marianne turns around. So many movies seem to meander and linger long after the emotional weight of the climax has completely dissipated. The Coen Brothers often feel like the only directors that understand abrupt endings are incredibly powerful if done right.",0
958," Seeing the movie again I now realize that reaction was wrong and bad and Sciamma is smarter and a much better writer than I am. “Turn around.” That scene where Marianne finally sees Heloise in the wedding dress in real life is going to haunt me for a long time. I absolutely love how every single frame of this film looks like it could be a painting. Sciamma has an amazing eye for that. This falls into my exact favourite romantic genre where >!the last 10 minutes are a devastating timeskip that makes me want to die.!< The slow-burn investment into their relationship is so worth it. There were several times where I think I just straight up stopped breathing. This is one of those amazing films where I thought it was okay but then the more I thought about it the more scenes just kept replaying in my mind and now I love it. The image of the faceless portrait, burning from the heart. The musical chant and the fiery dress. The haunting image of Heloise in her wedding dress. The tender kiss.",0
959,"Of course the best thing is the way the film pays off so brilliantly in the final two scenes. I can't believe a page number in a portrait could make me cry but the film has earned that brilliant catharsis. And of course the final shot, insanely acted by  Adèle Haenel but also a beautiful portrait of the way art that has informed our lives changes the way we interact with it.",0
960,Goddamn what an incredible movie. They just gave the Cesar to Polanski instead of Sciamma. End me. France really fucked themselves over by not submitting this for Best International Feature. It's far superior to Les Miserables and I think would have been a worthy rival to Parasite.,0
961,"Gorgeous film through and through. Beautifully somber, subtle screenplay about forbidden love. The performances are breathtakingly good - that Adele Haenel is straight up angelic in this. The cinematography, production design, costume design were all top notch. One of the best directed movies of 2019, everyone should see it at least once! Seeing the ending of this film in theaters is an experience I will never forget. I became so locked into that last shot, that at some point I had gotten tunnel vision and I realized I wasn’t breathing. And when it finally cut to black there was this amazing moment where I noticed that no one else, in a packed theater, was breathing either. Complete and devastating silence resonated in my ears and when the credits finally appeared, I broke down. I’m a straight male, and I never felt anything like that before. This is one of those films that transcends its own sexuality into a universal message of memory, regret, passion, loneliness, seclusion, etc. I could go on, but I’ve thought about this film every day since I saw it three weeks ago. A masterpiece. Fucking loved this.  ",0
962,My soul left my body when they showed the little 28 in the new portrait.  We're watching Marianne come to terms with her regret and her heart breaking all over again when they decide to flip it on us.  It honestly made me feel shit.,0
963,"It's a shame the actress who voiced the animated Belle, Paige O'Hara, or the first Broadway Belle, Susan Egan, didn't get cameo appearances in the film.",0
964,"The stained glass windows telling the prologue in the original was nice, but seeing it actually happen in this version was a good idea.",0
965,The objects losing their human forms at the end was just heart-wrenching. Beast can snowball with the best of 'em ,0
966,Edit:,0
967,"https://youtu.be/nVHhPJVcBlI I liked the references to the upcoming French Revolution. The excess shown in the beginning. And of course the part where the candle stick says.... This is France, and then chops some food as though he was operating a guillotine  Belle: ""Romeo and Juliet is my favorite play!"" ",0
968,"Beast: Omg what a basic bitch.  Belle never gets to eat her dinner during ""Be our Guest."" They keep pulling it away from her. I'm still thinking about this.  Biggest laugh of the film for me was when Maestro changed from a piano to a fucking mini gun. I thought it was pretty solid, and did the original justice. ",0
969,Making the prince older when he got cursed makes a whole lot more sense than cursing a child. ,0
970,Then saying it was magic that made the town forget the castle was nice. ,0
971,Having the enchantress basically heal and change the beast back at the end made more sense than him magically recovering from his injuries in the original. ,0
972,I'm also confused as to what the openly gay scene people freaked out about was.,0
973,"Was it during Gaston's song when LeFou had him hug him from behind? The dance at the end? If Disney hadn't said something, I wouldn't have had a second thought since LeFou always came across as gay to me. ",0
974, Oh poor Philippe had to go back and forth the forest so many times!! He barely escaped the wolves that many times too! Scariest scene in the movie= that doctor's plague mask Literally just sat up in bed because I had an epiphany.,0
975,"So in the beginning when Belle is singing the opening song, she runs into that one villager and asks him ""Have you lost something?"" and he says ""Yes, but I can't remember what."" ",0
976,We later find out at the very end of the movie that this villager is the husband of Mrs. Potts and the father of Chip. In the prologue of the movie it is said that all of the guests that were in the castle at the time of the curse were driven away from it and made to forget everything.,0
977,THAT'S WHAT HE FORGOT. HE FORGOT HE HAD A WIFE AND KID AND THAT HE'D BEEN TO THE CASTLE YEARS BEFORE. ,0
978,"Ugh, I hate when Disney makes me feel things. I need a moment. Sir Ian McKellen is a treasure.",0
979,"""Back into a clock! Back into a clock!"" All I want in life is that library. I'm glad they changed the scene about how Belle and Papa escaped the ""prison"", breaking the lock makes way more sense than Chip on an axe choppin machine. I wanted to see it happen, but that would have been so so off No one seems to be mentioning it but I absolutely loved what they did with Maurice. In the animated version he's this silly, bumbling, almost mad-scientist character, to the point where you can almost sympathize with Gaston for wanting him committed. In this version though, he's given a lot more backstory, his motives are a lot clearer (moving to a small village to protect Belle from plague, putting her first so much that he stops to get her a gift even while running away from a haunted castle). I thought Kevin Kline brought the perfect combination of wit and Mr. Fischoeder eccentricity to the role. In a story about intelligence and exposure to the outside world, I'm glad they didn't make Maurice a punchline. Gaston was clearly not eating 5 dozen eggs.  Anyone else noticed The Hunchback of the Notre Dame theme playing when Belle and Beast visited Paris? Plot Twist! Belle and her father get the plague from the rose rattle her plague infested mother kissed. This was fun.  I was worried about Dan Stevens voice for the beast before going in, but I was pleasantly surprised!",0
980,"Luke Evans did a great job, and Josh Gaad has a habit of stealing the scenes he's in.",0
981,I liked the changes made to most of the songs.,0
982,"I also forgot how much I love ""The Mob Song""",0
983,"For the bad . . . I wish they hadn't auto tuned Emma Watson and Dan Stevens so much. It's pretty obvious next to the rest of the cast who doesn't need it. And if you are going to auto tuned, do a better job. ",0
984,"They did not improve on the original film, but they did a good job in trying. So, at the end when Chip tries to jump off to find his 100 year old mother before they all turn inanimate, the saucer breaks.  Was that actually part of Chip, or is Chip just the cup, and the saucer was actually another object?  Was the saucer a dude?  Did we just watch a butler die? Is there a post credits scene that hints at a Kingdom Hearts Cinematic Universe? I was actually pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed getting to know the back stories of the characters, as well as seeing a lot of the glaring plot holes fixed. I especially loved how they humanized LeFou (and his joke about illiteracy was one of the funniest in the movie).  But honestly, I'd love any movie that features a singing Ewan McGregor... I have figured out the Disney live action remake formula that works:",0
985,1.) Cast someone from Downton Abbey (We'll call this the Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast Rule),0
986,2.) Cast someone from another fantasy franchise (Harry Potter in the case of BatB; Game of Thrones in the case of Cinderella),0
987,"3.) Don't mess with the plot (Mostly Maleficent, also Alice)",0
988,"4.) Don't cast Johnny Depp (Alice Alice Alice Alice) Just saw it and would say it was a positive movie experience. I knew if it was anything like the original it would be, at the very least an ok movie. And while it did stay true to the original it also added some new interesting moments that gave the audience more of an understanding with some of the movie's characters. The new added material was all great IMO and the only flaws lied within the recreation of some source material. ",0
989,Here are some thoughts I wrote down shortly after seeing it.,0
990,"Could have picked a better belle but Emma has star power and that's what sells. I like how her father was a little less quirky than in the original and the explanation of belles mothers death added a layer of emotion we haven't seen from our favorite Disney princess. Aside from giving belle(whose first love is reading) a ""spectacular"" library, beast also was the reason she finally understood why her father left Paris. Due to beast opening up that enchanted book, it provided the audience another reason Belle continued opening her heart to beast. Also the flower pin she got from where her mom died was a plot device used later in the movie to open the asylum carriage.. small details like this can often be the difference between good and bad movies. I like how they included the organ and he had a happy ending unlike in the Christmas movie haha. I thought Gaston did an excellent job and other then Lefeu's spelling of ""GASTON"" (which felt awkward and out of place) Gastons song was second only to Be our guest. Ewan hit all the right notes in what to me was the most visually spectacular scene in the movie. Maybe the only time in the entire movie where I didn't question whether it was real or not because frankly I didn't care, I felt like I was one of the guests. So overall beauty and the beast was an above average remake of a timeless Disney classic. It had a couple scenes that were really amazing and just a few heads scratchers. Recasting unforgettable characters is tough and Disney did a great job providing us a handful of performances that were just as good as the original. ""Everything's alive! What's your name?""",0
991,"""Belle that's a hairbrush"" Ouch, they didn't have the iconic line ""Marie! The baguettes, hurry up!"" 0/10 just for leaving out that.",0
992,"No, but seriously it was really good. Josh Gad as Lefou stole the movie for me. Every scene he was in had me cracking up. He was just naturally charming and funny. And I gotta say I love the Beast's song. All in all a really great adaptation of the original.",0
993,Did anyone else notice the John C Reilly cameo? cant stop thinking about that truck scene,1
994,"that shit reminded me of SPEED Bradley Cooper’s Jon Peters telling him that they’re both from the streets killed me. I felt like the whole segment was inspired by Kevin Smith’s account of interacting with him Lance saying he’s an atheist to Alaina’s dad at Shabbat dinner was pure gold Bradley Cooper was completely unhinged and was the funniest part of this movie imo. I'm not a big PTA fan in general, but I really loved this movie.  I thought it was funny, beautifully shot, and wonderfully acted.  Alana Haim is rightly getting tons of praise, but I thought Cooper Hoffman also gave one of the best performances of the year.",1
995,"The movie had really interesting themes about the way we deal with aging and how we view the passage of time.  Gary is a high schooler who isn't satisfied to just enjoy being a kid - he wants to grow up: have a career, start businesses, and be sophisticated.  He relishes being a regular at a nice restaurant, and brags to his friends that he could get them martinis.  It's no wonder he's drawn to an older woman like Alana and tries so hard to impress her.  ",1
996,"Alana, on the other hand, is stuck in a rut and struggling with adulthood.  Spending time with Gary feels like a return to earlier, simpler times.  I think her arc is especially interesting. Throughout the movie, she questions why she's hanging out with Gary and his friends instead of growing up.  After the running out of gas sequence, she seems fed up with how immature Gary is and wants to make a change.  She starts working in Sachs' office, and her relationship with Gary changes noticeably - she starts getting annoyed at him for messing up tasks and for not thinking about the  bigger picture beyond himself and his friends.  This continues up until the scene where Sachs invites her for a drink, only to reveal that she is being used as a cover.  Once Alana is reminded of how bleak and horrible the adult world can be, her first reaction is to go find Gary.  Both characters are struggling to be satisfied with where they are in their lives, and are using the other one to fill what they feel is missing. ",1
997,"Most nostalgia movies show a glossy version of the past where characters are at the peak of their lives.  Licorice Pizza is a throwback movie that centers around two characters who are fundamentally unhappy with the stage of life they're in.  I found that really interesting.  It's definitely a somewhat bittersweet movie, but it's highly watchable and it leaves you with a lot to think about. Let Me Roll it…perfect vibe for the scene that was in. I like that the two main characters are normal looking people. More Haim dad, please Watching this I felt like I was watching a modern classic. Loved it so much, especially Bradley Cooper and Bennie Safdie's arcs...",1
998,Then the ending went and ruined it.,1
999,"To me, Alana's friendship with Gary needed to stay platonic from a consent standpoint, and also because Gary represents Alana's refusal to grow up. Her conversation with the gay man gave me the impression that she was going to choose not to have a romance with Gary. She should have reconciled with Gary, made it explicitly clear that their relationship was platonic, and then left him disappointed but better for it; end of movie. Alana choosing romance is creepy and completely goes against that character trajectory. The movie ends and I'm supposed to feel warm and nostalgic and wistful, but instead I feel awkward and conflicted and angry.",1
1000,"There's still so much to love about the movie, but damn that ending really makes me hesitant to revisit it. So to be clear, Alana is 28, right? In the scene in the truck when she’s talking to Bradley Cooper’s character, it seems like she kinda slips up and says she’s 28 before correcting herself to 25.",1
1001,"I guess that can be interpreted as her lying to look more mature for Cooper’s character, but I’m not sure if that was the intention or not. I might be alone in this, but the age gap really took me out of it. Not just 10 years, but specifically 25 years to 15 years. It's just unrealistic to the point of being absurd. ",1
1002,"Still a very enjoyable film, but I feel like it's a perfect film if either of the characters would have been 19. Frustrating in that regard. I have a serious question.",1
1003,I LOVE PTA FILMS..but,1
1004,Did this movie have any character arcs?,1
1005,"Seems like all the characters are the same throughout the movie and never change, grow etc? When they were out of gas and rolling downhill, one if the houses they rolled past looks like the house that was robbed in Boogie Nights I watched this last night and didn’t realize how many characters (including the main character) were based on real-life people. Wikipedia definitely helped with that (please donate $2 to Wikipedia). ",1
1006,I didn’t even know the story was based on a real person. Or that PTA was married to Maya Rudolph! ,1
1007,"This is a film that has lived in my head for 24 hours despite walking out of the theater thinking, “yeah, that was pretty good.”",1
1008,I love when films have that effect. You can’t be mad at everyone. ,1
1009,"FUCK YOU DANIELLE I liked how pretty much every man Alana takes an interest in turns out to be an asshole. That includes Gary. I think when Matthew tells her they are basically all assholes she then picks Gary. Lance refusing to do the prayer gets her family mad at her. Jack allows her to fall off the motorcycle and doesn’t care. Joel is using her to appear straight and so on. So much running, and it looked better than any sports movie. I went with my wife and daughter, a 15-year-old cinephile who is ahead of the curve with her knowledge of cinema, and we all loved this movie. I legitimately felt emotional during the opening. After such a tough year for the world, it was truly a wonderful feeling to be sitting in a theater enjoying a new movie from PT Anderson.",1
1010,And that cameo of John C Reilly as Herman Munster was hilarious.,1
1011,10/10 loved this movie. Definitely favorite of the year for me too. the ending was weird and abrupt…but as a whole the movie was absolutely brilliant ? ,1
1012,fuck i just got out the theater and still processing it,1
1013,"the standout scenes for me was the truck scene and the safdie dinner scene which was unexpectedly emotional Am I the only one that felt like Alana was an opportunist when it came to her choice in men I think the only thing I liked about this movie was the soundtrack. I do not understand all the praise it's been getting from critics and in this thread. It was a meandering plot with two mostly unlikable characters leading the way and no real story arc. I found Cooper Hoffman insufferable throughout the film, just did not like that character at all which I hope was the point? The age gap is problematic, but not as much as how weird both of their characterizations were and how they just kind of rolled with it. It's really really fucking weird for a 25 year old to hang out with high school sophomores. That's not my biggest hang-up though, it's mostly with how there were multiple absurd scenes and scenarios that just kind of materialized out of nowhere. With the bad writing and weak dialogues I just couldn't get into it at all. I don't know, this film was mostly hollow and pointless to me. ",1
1014,"It's very strange to read multiple comments in here referencing OUATIH and how this was PTA's take on a similar nostalgia that Tarantino went for. They couldn't have been further apart in quality for me. I loved OUATIH with great pacing and sharp dialogue along with dynamite performances, loathed this one with how weak the product was and bounced before the final 30 minutes. It was kind of entertaining in bits and pieces, but it's just such a shoddy piece of work as a whole. What I loved about this film was how I related to both Gary and Alana. When I was 15, I had so much drive - taking AP classes, in speech and debate, hoping to go to Harvard law. Now that I'm 25, I feel like I'm in Alana's position. My life isn't going how I imagined it would be and I feel somewhat stuck. I'm struggling to hold on to a rapidly dwindling youthfulness while also trying to figure out how to actually make the world a better place. When you're 15, you want to be 25 and when you're 25, you wish you could be 15. I love PTA, and Licorice Pizza is a good movie, but ngl it let me down a bit. I felt the subplots varied wildly in quality and utility. The Bradley Cooper section was my favorite and the most engaging, but I found the Sean Penn subplot completely useless. Thankfully, Cooper Hoffman and Alana Haim carried the movie with their infectious banter, chemistry, and Anderson's excellent dialogue flowing from their mouths. Still, more than any other Anderson film I've seen, I felt self-indulgence and wonky pacing. No reason this movie had to be 2:15.",1
1015,&#x200B;,1
1016,"Every PTA movie I've seen has improved with repeat viewings, so I'm hoping that's the case here. The movie should have cut to black right when they fell over in front of the theater.",1
1017,"Vanessa: Usnavi, getting someone to co-sign for my apartment is the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me. ",0
1018,"Daniela: Am I a joke to you? Still watching, just thought it was a funny nod to another Miranda musical. The hold music for the college is the King George chorus from Hamilton. (30 min in) (sorry y'all, been drinking) So this was just one big ad for Tide To Go I loved the stylistic choices they made with Nina as far as her hair and outfits between coming back home with straight hair and then immediately keeping her natural hair once home>!, and leaving to go back to college without it as well!< This movie was such a joy to watch.",0
1019,"I've listened to the original broadway soundtrack of In the Heights countless times, so I was slightly jarred when some of the musical numbers were either cut or shuffled around. I'm pretty forgiving about this, so it's really not that big a deal to me. However, I was absolutely blown away at how ""Paciencia Y Fe"" was completely recontextualized by the slight tweaking of one or two lyrisc at the end of it. I'm curious about how others felt, but this totally worked for me.",0
1020,"""96,000"" and ""Carnaval Del Barrio"" (as expected) slapped so fucking hard. I think Benny and Nina’a dance along the side of the building the was my favorite part. The filming technique for that scene was incredible Anthony Ramos is exactly the right amount of attractive to play ""boy next door"" and also ""guy who gets the girl that everyone wants"" Am I crazy or did they start changing out and putting different Bodega stuff behind him while he was telling his story. I only noticed later on when I saw the Lottery sign behind him. I think they were slowly giving us hints at the ending. John M. Chu did a great job with this. It's exuberant and immersive, and feels like a fitting start to summer and getting back to life outside with other people. Can we talk about the random shot of a bright green crab skittering at the beach in the Dominican Republic... and then... cut to the end:",0
1021,"""I did the crab in the corner!"" ",0
1022,Also waiting for the inevitable fan theories about the other three little kids. I'm convinced at least one of them has got to be a Benny-and-Nina-spawn. The daughter was so perfectly cast that her reveal wasn't a surprise at all. The story of how Usnavi got his name is such a funny joke oh my god I loved this as a theater production. I knew there were going to be changes going into watching the movie and was curious how they would pull it off. And boy did they pull it off. The shuffling of the song order and changing of the characters’ backstories were incredibly well done. I found myself able to connect with them more. ,0

1035,"Honestly, the only complaints I have are stupid nitpicks that have to do with my own preferences. For example, I *love* ""Inútil"" in the original because I really love Kevin's struggle as a father, and thought it would be a very moving moment in the show (especially since he's now a single father), but the song is cut entirely. I understand why they had to since the Rosario family story is largely the thing they cut down to get the runtime down to a reasonable length, but I still miss it. ",0
1036,"Overall, the movie is great. The cast is phenomenal. The movie just soars along and is an absolute joy to watch. ",0
1037,"Some moments even stood out for me that hit even harder than the stage show, like the cuts to people desperately checking their lottery tickets/praying during ""96,000.""

This movie deserved all the praise ...Was Vanessa on the Joker Stairs near the end there? In the scene where she gets inspiration from the painter? I was a bit upset that they cut the Piragua reprise because I love that song, but I understood...then came the end credits. To me, this was a movie about the inherent tension that early generation Americans feel in this country and how to address it. Most of the arcs start in a place of avoidance. Usnavi and Nina are avoiding it by retreating to their roots. Vanessa is avoiding it by leaning into assimilation. However, by the end, these three all end up in a place where they're dealing with it head on. Usnavi and Vanessa start their community project and business to keep the culture alive in Washington Heights. Nina continues on with school so that she can fight the racism she's been subjected to and sees others subjected to. Paciencia y Fe was always a song I enjoyed but was never my favorite, but... wow. Might have been the best part of the whole movie, which is saying a lot. Okay, I have a question for the folks who have *only* seen the movie version:",0
1053,"What were your thoughts on the lottery winner reveal? Because in the original show, the winner is revealed during >!Paciencia y Fe!<, way earlier than what was shown here. In fact, pretty much every song after that point references the winner and thus there were quite a few changed lyrics in the movie to keep the secret. Specifically, entire sections were cut from >!Blackout!< and >!Carnaval del Barrio!<.",0

It was an extremely cool callback to the beginning and oddly heartwarming. We complained about how many times we had to watch Uncle Ben die, and now we’re being punished by having to watch Peter Parker die twice in one year  I think one of my favorite parts of the movie was that while it managed to be hilarious and silly, but they never undercut the important moments with humor. The film took itself seriously when it needed to.  Doc Ock's design is RIDICULOUSLY thoughtful and wonderful. Her plasticky/rubbery arms move more like an octopus than regular ock's. And the hair in profile looks just like an octopus head. I'm so happy Liv exists.

It definitely wasn't perfect, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a blast with this film. The zoomed out shot of Arthur and Mera diving into the ocean with the flare surrounded by the trench creatures was freakin' awesome. Also really liked the camera angles/movements for the action shots. Definitely my favorite that DC has put out so far. Definitely down for a sequel!

1086,[Here's a link to the previous pseudo-official discussion thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7zpv3a/psuedoofficial_discussion_annihilation_spoilers/),0
1087,"EDIT: Discussion is temporarily stickied again for the Netflix release. That fucking bear with a woman's scream. Nightmares I don't know if my comment posted but I was intrigued that the house the team stayed in within the Shimmer looked just like Portman's house. Also when Portman drinks water at the end two water circles are created out of the sip which is very interesting imagery.  I went into my second viewing having absorbed the consensus theory online about how this was all about the characters' various forms of ""self-destruction"", but I came away this time with a pretty strong sense of what it was really about on a higher level. I think the self-destruction angle is definitely a theme, but it can't be everything because a) it's too on-the-nose since that concept was explicitly discussed in at least two different conversations between characters and this is definitely a movie that wants to be smarter than that, and b) it's a really sad and bleak message, and I actually think this is ultimately a hopeful, if somewhat solemn, movie. I'm curious to see what people think about my interpretation.",0
1088,"What I think this movie is about is: Personal change. It's like Lena says at the end-- the Shimmer wasn't destroying, it was changing, making ""something new"". I started thinking about this concept during my second viewing when I realized just how strongly the film seems to revolve around her relationship with Kane. It starts out with ""him"" returning to her, and it ends with the two of them together, with all those intervening flashbacks. Obviously this movie ultimately wants to be *about them* and perhaps say something about the nature of relationships. ",0
1089,"Before Kane goes into the Shimmer, their marriage is damaged-- she's having an affair and he knows about it. We see that they have a legitimate spark, but we know that something is broken. We see him distant, struggling with what to do. So he goes off on his quest of ""self-destruction"". But I think the Shimmer actually represents something more- a place people find themselves at times in their lives, a sort of mental purgatory where some kind of facing of fears and personal change is required in order to move on. Some kind of ""self-destruction"" might be a necessary part of that process, if one needs to shed parts of themselves that hold back progress. It also requires facing your anger and deepest anxieties. And like Josie says, some people when they encounter a stage of personal transformation, will be eager to face it, some will fight it, and some might just peacefully accept. ",0
1090,So here's how I see the events of the movie from a totally metaphorical standpoint:,0
1091,"Kane goes off on his journey. He's so hurt, sad, and damaged that when he faces the possibility of drastically changing who he is, he yields to this impulse and allows the doppelganger to return in his place. He comes back to Lena but he's not the same man, and his new self is unstable, and too alien for her to accept. His transformation has threatened to be their final separation. Lena feels responsibility for what has happened, and is now given a choice, and posed to her by Ventress at the base: she could retreat and ""go home"", abandoning Kane and their relationship. But she has given up her affair and resolved that she ""want[s] to be with him"", which will require her own journey of self-appraisal, facing down of fears, and transformation. So she sets out on her personal struggle as well, to face her lies, anxieties, and yearnings. When her turn comes to face the new person that threatens to take over her identity, she cannot accept it as readily, and mostly preserves her current self. But having resolved her internal struggle and committed to enough of this journey of transformation, she returns to Kane and accepts him in his current state. They embrace, having a shared experience and newfound understanding. It doesn't matter who either of them once were or is now-- they have accepted and forgiven the past and will move forward together. ",0
1092,"People face all kinds of internal struggles and crises, and usually don't stay the way they were when we first met them. Staying committed to a relationship, or any endeavor in life, takes hard work, and asks that people take a hard look at themselves, decide which parts they can live with, and allow themselves to grow and change with each other. When times of struggle and transformation come, it's up to each individual how much to resist and struggle against change, and how much to accept it. Sometimes we don't have that much control over it. But at the end of the day, only through waging our own lonely internal battles can we understand and accept others as flawed and dynamic fellow human beings, and learn to move forward together, whether in a romantic relationship or otherwise.",0
1093,"I think ""annihilation"" here refers to the annihilation of the broken past, or parts of the self, that is sometimes needed to move on constructively.",0
1094,"Whew, I hope this makes some sense to people and I'm not just a crazy rambler. My jaw was on the floor during the whole bear scene. Absolutely dreadful yet amazing at the same time Anyone else obsessed with that one theme that played towards the end? It was hauntingly mesmerizing and cosmic sounding.  An interesting allusion I saw during the movie was immediately after they killed the freaky skeleton bear thing.",0
1095,"The physicist, reflecting on what just happened, talks about how ""it must be horrible to die scared and in pain and only having your screams of fear live on as the only remnant of you"" or something to that effect referring to how the voice of the woman who got dragged off by the bear still lived on in that bear. ",0
1096,"Later on, we see a scene where Lena is reading ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" next to Kane in a flashback. The book details the story of Henrietta Lacks, a woman who died from cancer in the middle 20th century but who had her cervical cancer cells taken during her treatment by a physician (without Lacks' consent or knowledge) for research purposes. Those cancer cells from Lacks live on today as the HeLa immortal cell line and have been used (and continue to be used) extensively as a study model for many important biological innovations (e.g. Salk tested his polio vaccine on these cells).",0
1097,"It seems like Garland is pointing to Lacks as a real life example of what happened to the woman who got killed by the bear; it would be terrible for you and your family to know that the only part of you physically living on is the mutated cancer cells that ultimately killed you. No matter how much good has and will be done with these cells, these cells that were once you and that ultimately unmade you will be the only vestiges that define your legacy. This movie has to win some type of award for set design or art direction. Natalie Portman is stellar in this movie.  During he scene where her husband returns, her facial expressions go from 0-60 in 3 seconds flat and it is amazing. The ending reminded me of that movie Under The Skin...like a lot. Anyone agree? Okay when her copy/alien thing got into a crouch position and that weird trailer sound played , I literally got goosebumps it was so beautiful  My dad was furious that they left the tower to go to some tiny tiny stand for 'guard duty' vs staying up top. Like he was furious.  If I remember correctly, was the house they entered in the shimmer (where the bear attacks) the same as her house outside the shimmer? The stairs and rooms looked identical. Was that on purpose? The bear skeleton with a human voice is the creepiest fucking thing I've seen and *heard* in years. Holy shit. Me during the first act: This is OK.  Acting is weirdly wooden, and some of this dialogue is really hammy.  Also this reminds me a bit too much of Arrival. ",0
1098,"Me during the second act: Alright, I'm enjoying this more now.  Also it's become a combo of Aliens and The Thing, so that's cool.  Refracting movie DNA. ",0
1099,Me during the final act: DEAR GOD IN HEAVEN. ,0
1100,"Five stars.  Would've liked a little more time spent on Tessa Thompson's character. Her last scene was such a punch to the gut.  I can understand why the director was upset about this movie not being seen in theaters overseas. This film is absolutely meant to be seen on the big screen. The first shot of Lena cheating is a few second clip of her riding her colleague. When the movie cuts back to her, that's the moment she enters the shimmer.",0
1101,"At the military base, there is a cut back to Lena and Kane's home where Kane is leaving early. He brings her orange juice and sets it by the bedside table. This scene ends with Kane saying, ""I do love you Lena."" The cut back is of a cell dividing into two that Lena is looking at through a microscope. ",0
1102,"In the house in the shimmer where the team stays, which looks like Lena and Kane's home, Lena is looking at her own cells divide. Then a scene change to where Lena, having fucked her colleague, says that has to stop and she'll never do it again. The cut back to the house is ""You lying bitch!"" as Anya slams Lena's head with the butt of a rifle. There is a cut for a couple of seconds back to Kane and Lena's empty bed with the orange juice on the bedside on the table (so this is a reference to Kane's departure scene.) The cut back to the house has Ventress, Lena, and Josie tied up.",0
1103,"The final cut from the shimmer to Kane and Lena is immediately after we see ""The Lighthouse"" title screen. Kane and Lena are on the couch reading. They say ""Hey"" to each other. The body language, the way they say something as simple as ""Hey"" to each other - it's clear they're in love. They have something special. Cut back to the shimmer and Lena is doubled over crying.",0
1104,There's been a few scattered comments that the affair wasn't needed to tell the story. The affair and the destruction it created? That is the story. Everything else in the movie is an exploration of that.,0
1105,"At its heart, Annihilation is a love story - though a tragic one. It's about love lost. Lena damages her own marriage (Ventress explicitly states how happy people do things like that, to make sure the audience gets the point) and then takes a journey to try and save it. It can't be saved though. The Kane she loved is gone.  ",0
1106,"It has been really enjoyable reading redditors' interpretations of this film. Metaphysics, Jungian, fractals, self-destruction, depression, and more. These are amazing to read and give much to think about. Alex Garland - the director and screenwriter - was a literature writer before making movies. Like many writers, he's probably extremely well-read. The number of different influences people spot in this film are unlikely accidental. I'm going to guess Garland really, really knows his shit. This is a monumental work and, in my view, one of the most intelligent and greatest films ever created.",0
1107,"You know how sometimes you're talking about a great movie from decades past and think, ""It must have been insane to haves seen that in the theaters when it first came out. I wonder what that must have been like."" I suspect that 20-30 years from now, film fans will be saying that about Annihilation. If you've ever suffered personal pain so intense that you've entered a period of self-destruction, you've entered the shimmer.",0

1109,"* Communication to the outside world is cut off. If you've been in a hole, you know it's tough for others to reach you and you to reach out.",0
1110,"* Reality gets distorted. Events of the past and who you are get reflected in a way that is a mutation of reality. This could lead to seeing things horrifically but also can lead to seeing creative, beautiful things too - as Lena noted. (And why many artists have periods of self-destruction.) ",0

1112,"* Some who enter the shimmer don't want answers and they don't want out. The fight is gone.

This is a moving portrayal of depression and would guess this part hits some people very, very hard.",0

Sometimes in life one reaches a situation so painful that one does not have the ability to handle it - something like a mental breakdown. At that point in life, who somebody is - their identity - incapable of handling the present situation has no choice but to blow themselves up. The Kane that survives the shimmer is a clone, he's not the Kane that went in. This could be seen as a metaphor for those who when entering a period of self-destruction get hammered and destroyed. They make it out, but the person who makes it out is not the same person who entered.",0
1115,"Lena reaches the lighthouse and the alien, her enemy, the one that blocks the door from her escaping, the one that mirrors and mimics her, she sees as herself. ",0
1116,This is perhaps an inspirational message to those dealing with self-destructive issues. It's you who is blocking you and the only way you make it out of the shimmer is to blow that shit up.,0
1117,"Once she does that, the shimmer vanishes and Kane recovers. This may be a metaphor for somebody who successfully is able to defeat  their self-destructive tendencies. Things return to normal and those around them heal, even if nobody is quite the same as before they entered.",0
1118,"And for the shimmer appearing in their eyes. If you have been through a period of self-destruction, you can often see it in the eyes of others who have been there too. This may sound silly to some but those experiences really do change one's character. One can often pick out others who have been down a similar path. A take-away I got from this film is that there are so many more dimensions to gore than gallons of blood. The bear and the pool wall have been discussed heavily already, but I was most disturbed by [the quick shot of Gina Rodriguez's tongue lolling out of her torn face after she was mauled.](#spoiler) The shimmer mimics and refracts what was there originally as well as what and who enters it. Every person that entered the shimmer was chosen or volunteered because really they had nothing to live for. Ventress says that people don't commit suicide, they self-destruct. So she sends purely self-destructive people into the shimmer which is I assume why the shimmer was growing. The shimmer didn't have a want or desire, it changed based on what went into it. The people going into the shimmer were destructive so the shimmer was destructive. Lena was the first to break that cycle because she had something to go back for. Her mirrored shimmer self didn't have a want, which is why she could destroy it without it fighting back. Kane didn't have a want to go back so he self-destructed and sent the new innocent shimmer version of himself back to Lena, the shimmer version doesn't know their past. While the real Lena does and will have to live with her decisions. The shimmer will continue to mimic and change and create based on what it encounters. The way I see it is that there is potential for it to create new good in the world if thats what its shown, but throughout the movie it is only shown bad. I see the ending as hopeful, that there is a chance of positive change, or just a lot more bad. Is it just me or did Kane (the real one) have a weird southern accent on the lighthouse tape?   That motherfucking wall in the pool, guys...",0

1121,"To make matters worse/better, the projector in my screening fucked up shortly after that scene so when they got the projector up and running, they started back just as they were walking into the beginning of the pool scene, so I got to marvel at it twice! I really, really enjoyed Annihilation. Despite leaving out significant themes from the book, the movie told a complete, hallucinogenic, and engrossing story. The film left things out in a way that wasn't annoying or manipulative. ",0
1122,"I really loved the feeling, tone, and pace of the whole production. The soundrack/score were wonderful. And, of course, the Rob Hardy's cinematography/imagery were brilliant. Manbearpig was terrifying.",0
1123,"Don't know if anyone else had this reaction, but when Louise and Ian first arrived at the encampment and the doctor was preparing to immunize them, one of the questions he asked Louise was ""Are you pregnant?"" I expected there to be a slight emotional beat here, whether it be a pause, or a look or something. But Louise answered a pretty straightforward ""No."" I thought to myself at the time, that's interesting--not sure I totally understand Amy's decision to be so stoic about her character's past there. But man did that make sense later! Brilliant work by Amy and Mr. Villeneuve. I think this is one that demands repeated viewing.  Jesus, Abbott and Costello were translated into Batman and Robin in my country. It just occurred to me that the reason the Shells do not emit any communication is that, in fact, they communicate with each other in the future whenever it is convenient. So, at the present time, there is no need for Shell-to-Shell communication. Fun Fact:  The founder of Wolfram Alpha was brought onto the project to help develop the visual language. His son wrote a program that would decode the individual words in each logogram.  ",1
1124,The effects on screen when the language is being analyzed is a practical effect.  Screen writer said they are hoping to release the heptapod language to the public soon.   Let's discuss the design of the aliens. ,1
1125,"The very first reveal I thought oh no they're giant squid things.  But once they started walking and the legs bent weren't symmetrically aligned I really enjoyed them.  When it's said that the heptapods told the Russians, ""There is no time,"" and everyone interprets it as a threat or a sign to hurry… and they're literally trying to say that time doesn't exist to them—what a subtle way to sum up everything. It seems like such a throwaway line.",1
1126,"I loved that this wasn't even addressed later. It's just there, and, if you missed it the first time around, it'd mean something totally different on a second viewing. Way to trust the intelligence of the audience! Guys I can't put my finger on it, but something about the flashbacks with her daughter were just beautiful. I don't know why it brought so much to the table for me but it is just jaw dropping how engrossing it was How are the humans going to help in 3000 years???? I freaked the FUCK out when it cut to that heptapod in the room  I have to say, my favorite characters in the whole film were Abbott and Costello. Especially when Louise figures it all out and goes to converse with Costello at the end. I was riding in the car home and it just hit my brother and I that the two heptapods *knew* there was a bomb in their ship. They knew how long they had left, and when Louise and Abbott write on the barrier together, Costello ""swims"" away. Abbott *knew* his death was approaching, but he stayed behind to not only data dump the language panel, but also to save Ian and Louise from the explosion.",1
1127,"Abbott was the real MVP of the movie. I guess this hasn't been said yet: When Ian arrives at the site, he asks someone what they've discovered yet and the man replies something along the lines of: ""We showed them algebra, which they don't seem to understand but they respond when we display calculus"". This is because solving algebra is linear whereas calculus and up requires a wisdom that spans multiple ""dimensions"".   ",1
1128,"I cheated because I read the book first so I knew what was going on beforehand but this little detail was something that I appreciated for its subtlety. The book proposes that the difficulty levels of algebra and calculus are switched so that for humans, learning algebra to calculus is easier whereas for the aliens the opposite is true (interesting to wonder what process they use to learn how to communicate with humans as ours is on a linear time frame).   If you're curious, the thing that Amy Adams said to change General Shang's mind was ""War does not make winners, only Widows.""",1
1129,I saw the movie at Fantastic Fest and the writer (Eric Heisserer) did a Q&A afterwards. [deleted] Just got back from a 7 PM show and here's the short version: A beautifully shot film gives way to an even more beautifully told story that becomes so much more than your typical alien invasion movie. If you're a fan of sci-fi or great movies in general then you owe it to yourself to see this.,1
1130,"It isn't often that I say to myself ""Damn, that was a really cool shot"" mere minutes into the movie but I certainly did that tonight. Villeneuve strikes again with his usual great cinematography and a fantastic musical score accompanies each scene seemingly perfectly. It's not often musical scores stand out to me but this one certainly did. Film is at its core a work of art, and Arrival certainly qualifies in that regard.",1
1131,"The pacing does get a little slow in the second act, but it's required for properly displaying the monumental effort that it took to learn how to communicate even on a basic level with the aliens. The movie does a great job making both viewer and actor feel like they're learning together and that really helps with the immersion factor. Things are just open ended enough as to where you don't really know the aliens' true intentions right until the end so it keeps you guessing as to what they really want here. ",1
1132,"The final sequence of the film left very few dry eyes in my theatre and this is quite possibly the highlight of a fantastic score with violin that perfectly fit the mood, capping it beautifully. You owe it to yourself to experience this in the theatre as was intended.  the music was absolutely breathtaking So the aliens said they were here to help humanity. They brought humans a weapon (tool). This tool is their language. ",1
1133,"Using this language, humanity will be better, stronger, and United. ",1
1134,They are doing this because in 3000 years they (the aliens) will need humanities help. ,1
1135,Am I understanding that correctly?,1
1136,"Amy Adams is the only one who knows how to think with time travel at the moment. Am I to assume that once you understand the alien language, you will be able to think with time travel as well? That is, they are sharing this tool with all of humanity if they study it, not just her. So this ""gift"" won't die off when she does?",1
1137,"Just want to make sure I understood it correctly. Great movie! Man... The media precedences in this make me still angry... Because it's accurate. ""WE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT, KILL IT"".. the Chinese leading an attack making it okay for others to follow suit. ",1
1138,"The foreshadowing of soldiers listening to the media and planting the bomb seems totally plausible. No one wanted to listen to the girl actually communicating with these aliens, instead they needed to protect their soil. ",1
1139,"The primal forms of communication were beautiful. I loved the time lapse and computer algorithm to translate language in the spot too. The best of rudimentary and new age science languages.  3000 years from now, the Heptapods are being attacked by their brethren aliens from Edge Of Tomorrow. Was anyone else disappointed that the kangaroo story wasn't true? Time is a flat circle.  I love looking at the c4 scene from the aliens perspective.",1
1140,"They can see time entirely, abbot knows it's death approaches and still goes through with it.",1
1141,"I like how they weren't entirely benevolent either, they just for some reason would need humanities help so they were uplifting our sense of time One thing about this movie that I really loved (and there were plenty!) was its ultimately positive message. I was half-expecting humans to be annihilated or something, but to find that the aliens were peaceful and that working together is how we move forward was powerfully delivered and a sentiment that is in dire need of being spread, especially after this week.",1
1142,"That aside, the theory behind how we'd approach first contact and how the relationship between language and thinking would influence this meeting was absolutely thrilling to watch. The intrigue I felt watching it was something I haven't felt in a very long time.",1
1143,"Also, while I do think this movie stands on its own quite well, I would not be opposed to another film in the same universe that delves into the impending conflict 3000 years into the future. Maybe it could be like Sicario in space?  Round of applause for an awesome movie that is not a sequel, spin-off, or super hero movie. We need as many of those as possible.  If you loved this movie please encourage as many people as you can to go see it in Theaters so that studios will realized there is room for intelligent Science Fiction still today. [deleted]",1
1144,"Can we all just agree mads mikkelsen dancing to this trippy song is the biggest gift of this year. Another reminder of how much I love Mads Mikkelsen, he puts on such an engaging performance no matter what he's in.",0
1145,"When I saw the initial play time I thought it might overstay its welcome but I was surprised how good it was through and through. I actually teared up toward the the end when I saw the kid with the glasses at the funeral and realized how invested I was in it. The film really made me think about my own relationship with alcohol in the past few years, especially during this pandemic. I would like to offer my analysis of some of the themes and motifs I believe the film contain, particularly that of water, coldness, light/darkness and inside/outside.",0
1146,"I would first like to establish that I believe outside vs. inside and light vs. dark represent openness, freedom and acceptance versus shame, loss of control and difficulty coping, as it most often does in fiction. Cold, particularly that of chilled liquids, represent resignation or distance, and the temptation thereof. Finally I wish to put forth the notion that water and all things aquatic represent balance and life itself.",0
1147,"Let me start with water, the source of all life. Throughout the film water plays a central part, not only as the alternative to alcohol, but also as a symbol for life itself, living, balance or simply being present and ""alive"". The most obvious case of this is if course the fact that you should, unless you want a hangover, balance your intake of alcohol and water. Water is also the alternative to the somewhat destructive alcohol, but it is also the main constituent of every drink. Also, all life stems from the ocean, and humans die without water, so there's that. But let us look at the way this is expressed in the film in less obvious ways. A characters proximity or relationship to water will often represent how much, or how well, they are living or ""alive"", as well as their relationship to alcohol.",0
1148,"Tommy, the oldest of the gang, drowned. He couldn't handle life, and so his life was reclaimed by the sea. He was also the only one who couldn't swim, a clear parallel. Yet, Tommy had not only lived a longer, but maybe more of a life, than the others, as he was older and was divorced. He had experience with life, and thus he was the only owner of a boat, you know, because the sea is life.",0
1149,"Nikolaj, the bearded psychology teacher, lives a pretty good life. He lives in a house with a view of the sea, and we not only go there later, but Nikolaj even mentions this at his party as one of the signs that he has a good life. He is permanently close to water, close to being truly ""alive"", even if he is troubled by some minor leaking issues. Martin, however, also has a wife, kids and the same job, but he lives nowhere near water. In the beginning of the birthday party scene, Martin drinks water. Plain sparkling water, no lemon, please. Sure, he is living, but living a plain, boring life. When Martin truly starts to live, thanks to alcohol, he takes his family canoeing on a lake, something they haven't done in years. The relationship between Martin and Anika haven't been alive in years, but for ""ten minutes"", as Martin later puts it, it is. In the end, Martin, now having maybe found a spark or way to get back to living (he is dancing again after all this time) throws himself into the sea, into life.",0
1150,"This theme manifests itself many more times throughout the film, it even opens with a bunch of young people enjoying life around a lake. Peter is present enough to notice the struggling student while washing his hands, he also drunkenly jumps into the harbor, but swims, and we later learn he has met a woman and helps a student pass his exam. Almost everything they eat comes from the sea (caviar, cod, prawns), and when they are drunk and loosing their grip on the experiment they fail at both buying a fish and catching one. In the final scene in Tommy's apartment before he dies, water is suspiciously absent: we see Martin feed Tommy's dog, but not give it water, they eat pasta, not seafood, and the dishes are cleaned into the trash and not washed in the sink above.",0
1151,"I would like to quickly include three more scenes and my interpretations. The first one is the fishing scene. Martin, who is now using alcohol to kind of cheat at ""living"", maybe having misunderstood it's purpose in a balanced life, is also misusing the fishing net as a spear to ""cheat"" at catch a fish. The second scene is the fireside 20-questions Martin has with his family. He is embodying an animal and the others are guessing which animal he chose. His wife, a woman who is still somewhat in touch with life, asks him if he lives in the sea. Martin declines. I interpret this as Anika asking him if he is someone who is ready, or even able, to live, but in Martins own mind he still thinks of himself, or maybe knows, he is not somebody who is ready to live unaided by alcohol. He is not a fish. This might lead Anika to let slip her affair to Martin later, as she now knows it is hopeless to wait any more. The final scene is the first scene with Martin and Anika, where he asks her if he is boring. In this scene Martin is reading, and Anika is readying herself to go to work, or as it is revealed later, meet another man. This is foreshadowed by Anika readying herself by going into the bathroom, where the water is, because she is ""living"", and when Martin asks if he is boring, the camera finally brings into focus the poster on the wall: An old poster of seashells. Once alive in the ocean, now dead, fossilized and barely a memory of the life it had in the ocean. Just like Martin. This is repeated a few minutes later when Martin is leaving for the party: Anika is going out, so she briefly visits the bathroom, and Martin is in the foreground failing to live, with the poster in the background. Not to mention another fish-poster in his kitchen a few moments later, like a photo of a Martin that once was.",0
1152,"Now let us briefly cover the many cold moments of the film. I get it, a movie about alcohol is bound to include some ice, but there are many gratuitous frames of cold glasses and ice.   I propose this symbolizes resignation and distance, and the temptation of indulging in this. This is perhaps most notable in the scene between Martin and Anika where they meet in the restaurant and Anika orders a chilled glass of wine, while Martin drinks water. Anika is resigned from the relationship. Some time before this, Nikolajs wife specifically tells her husband she wants fresh cod, not frozen. She is still invested in their relationship, and reminds her husband not to forget this. At the end, the men are battered and defeated by the loss of their friend, and thus they are given cold glasses to drink from. At the beginning Martin is persuaded by the chilled vodka to start drinking and forget his plans for the next day, and later by the magnificently misting drink with a huge ice ball in it. Martin also hides his alcohol under a bag of ice in his freezer.",0
1153,"Finally I would like to discuss the theme of light and darkness, as well as open spaces and confined spaces, as a symbol of control, coping and relationship to alcohol. The film both opens and ends with people enjoying alcohol, and to a larger extend, life, outside in the sun. Nikolaj, the person with the most control and ""best"" life, lives in a bright and open house, with large windows looking out over the sea, drinking openly in his home. Martin lives in a more enclosed house with fewer windows, and frequently sits in more darkness than others, and in the beginning he is visibly more exposed and vulnerable in his brightly lit classroom than his friends. He is more private with his drinking, often standing in front of a large window in his study room. Perhaps this is where he can feel relaxed and in control? Tommy on the other hand lives in a small apartment with few windows, most covered by something, but he is also outside a lot, showing how his character tries to appear as in control to others, but privately is slipping, as he is seen both hiding and stashing his alcohol and deceiving others when it comes to when/how he drinks. ",0
1154,"Peter goes on a journey. He starts of with an open music hall and office, but as the drinking starts to get out of hand, he closes the curtains in both the music hall and his office, and starts to drink hidden alcohol. In the end, after regaining more control, he is seen in bright classrooms helping the struggling student cope. This visual motif is present other places in the film, such as when Peter discovers the crying student and takes him from a brightly lit hallway into a dimly lit classroom, or how the men are dancing and having fun in Nikolajs open living room, then being a nuance in the dark, windowless pub, or how Nikolaj starts by being peed on while sleeping in the open living room, then later pees himself in the small bedroom or how the happy students in the opening turn into hooligans after dark in the cramped tram. One could even argue that Tommy ends up in one of the most confined spaces imaginable.",0
1155,"Does anybody else share my interpretation? Loved it, probably my favourite of the year. I don't think the message is as simple as ""drinking can be good for you but don't so it too much.""",0
1156,I think it was that alcohol can loosen you up a bit but ultimately it's you that has to make the change within yourself. Alcohol made Nikolaj admit to himself he was unhappy with his family life (and exacerbate it) and he makes the choice to improve it. Peter admits he wants a partner and is dating someone by the end of the movie. Tommy perhaps doesn't see much of a life for himself and falls into alcoholism leading to his demise.,0
1157,"Alcohol makes Martin feel good but outside of one camping trip it doesn't make him a more present father/husband. Even when at his drunkest, he refuses to dance despite encouragement from his friends, he's not able to be his true self. It's not til the end when he's suffered loss, connected with his students and decided to try and rebuild his marriage that he's finally able to dance. Alcohol took him on a wild ride, and magnified the positive and negative aspects of himself/his life, but ultimately he had to make the choice to grow before he could feel like himself. Besides the drinking themes, the film is also a box of condensed Danish culture. Everything in the movie is extremely Danish. The pop music. The classical music and choir songs. The high school graduates with red band hats celebrating their freedom driving from home to home in the back of a decorated truck. The fancy Copenhagen gourmet restaurants. The bodegas (pubs) with draft beer. The quotes from Soren Kirkegaard. The diffent types of homes and classical architecture and design. The lakes and the ocean. It is basically an homage to Danish culture. An amazing film, it's quite disappointing that this film isn't getting much hype for award season because it really deserves it. When Mads decides to take it to 0.10 and his friends watch him deftly move around the teacher's lounge like some mad genius and then he walks right into a wall.  That's when I lost it. Felt like I was having my mid life crisis and I’m in my early 20s Just watched the movie, and coming from Denmark myself, I definitely believe the movie doesn't paint alcohol in a good or bad light. It actually accurately portrays just how drinking is in Denmark, though with some exaggerating parts (such as the high school student claiming he drinks 80 beers worth of alcohol in a week, this is more normal for University students).",0
1158,"I my opinion, much of the movie's meaning lies in its opening quote from Søren Kierkegaard: ""What is youth? A dream. What is love? The content of the dream."" Youth is not just a number, it's something you live and stop living when there's no love, of your life and of the world. Martin is going through a rough period of life, for whatever reasons, and for years he has been unable to find the spirit of his former youthful self (the one Anika misses), which is briefly brought back as the excitement of his success with alcohol boosts his mood, making him find the desire to go camping with family, make love with his wife, and enjoying his life. This all blows up when he's unable to control his consumption, and end up in an embarrassing situation that reveals his family knowing about his alcohol abuse, his wife's cheating on him, ultimately ending in divorce.",0
1159,"Before his death, Martin's childhood friend tells Martin ""I'm rooting for you, for you and Anika. It's always been the two of you"". These words serve as a motivation for Martin to rekindle lost love, and while partaking in the funeral dinner with his friends, he sees his students partying at their traditional high school graduation ""truck tour"" celebration, and receives a text from his ex-wife, telling she misses him a lot. This confirmation of rekindling his relationship with Anika and seeing the joyful students that he managed to prepare for their exam finals (to make up for his own subpar performance as a teacher) makes him love again. Love his life, love now, love the world. He finally finds a reason to dance, and let's go in euphoria as his soul, almost in an instant, looks 30 years younger. That compilation of drunk world leaders had me struggling to breathe through the laughter, holy fuck The football match part with speckled kid was really heartwarming. Of course, the end dance sequence is amazing. Is a best actor nomination for Mads likely? His performance was so good but I know international film performances are not generally nominated but the movie's definitely getting a lot of buzz and I just think he really deserves one what's the moral of the story? keep to 0.05%? What a great movie. Second best of the year for me after Trial of The Chicago 7.",0
1160,"I find movies about 40-somethings and middle-age crises very relatable, even though i’m in my 20s. That feeling of being lost and wondering where’a all the hope and promise of being 16 and happy?",0
1161,"Vinterberg is a really great director. This, Festen, The Hunt. All amazing movies.",0
1162,Freeze frame at the end is perfect.,0
1163,"Also, how hilarious was that cut from them in the store buying fresh cod, realizing they don’t have it, and cut to them trying to catch it? I laughed. Just awesome. Can’t wait for the American adaptation starring Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson! God bless Specs. I love the whole film but the final scene just made my heart soar. ",0
1164,It’s been a couple of days since I watched it and I’ve caught myself a few times replaying that scene in my mind. ,0

1166,"I'm an ex-drinker with ~650 days of sobriety. To me, this whole movie represents the ebb and flow of being a problem drinker.",0
1167,You start like Martin did at the restaurant. You know you shouldn't have that first drink because you have been doing well and you have other responsibilities that you may need to tend to later. Then you see everyone else having fun and decide to have one. That one drink goes down so damn good and feels so warm that you let your guard down and embrace the buzz. ,0
1168,"In the middle of the movie, it's like the middle of a binge. You feel invincible and want to keep the party/buzz going. Around you, others may notice you are acting like a fool but, in your head, you are the coolest person in the room. Everything is so much more enjoyable, and there is an adventure around every corner. Things are going so well until you push yourself too far, blackout, and fuck up.",0
1169,"The scenes with Nicholaj struggling to get up the stairs and pissing the bed/pissing off his wife, and Martin passed out in the street hit especially hard. I have been in both of those scenarios. After a particularly messing weekend, I would typically swear the stuff off for a few weeks or months.",0
1170,"The climax is the doom and the gloom when the binge is over, and you have to face your consequences. The lighting even shifted from warm and fun to stark white and cold - colors I relate with a harsh hangover.",0
1171," That final scene to me is Martin submitting to alcohol all over again. He is trying to make things work with his wife, but the call to fun and antics is too enticing, and he says fuck it and starts the binge again, igniting another cycle of drinking, fucking up, feeling remorse, and rinsing and repeating. The fact the film managed to make you so emotionally invested in all four main characters was amazing. Like the scenes with the student who had to retake the year could’ve been extraneous but ended up being so heartwarming. ",0
1172,"And yes, that beautiful ending. Wow that final scene was fucking incredible. It hurts to know that no matter what I do in life i’ll never be nearly as cool as Mads Mikkelsen. He’s something else entirely This movie was fucking amazing, RIP coach. Specs and I are going to miss you.",0
1173,"Apparently this all hit close to home for the director? Don't really get it but they and the rest of their team made a great film regardless. just finished watching this and i really enjoyed it. I see some people saying it wasnt really I happy ending but I thought it was because Martin's reason for getting drunk was in celebration of what was going on in his life (students graduating, wife texting him) whereas the entire movie he was drinking to kind of escape his life? Idk if that makes sense but the different interpretations of this movie make me like it even more The ending is so incredible in this, maybe the best of the year!",0
1174,Ties everything together SO well. Really love the movie ‘the hunt’ previously from this director so was excited to check this out. He always brings up interesting questions and topics that feel truthful and challenge you.,0
1175,"Another round does a lot of the same. I love how it depicts alcohol. It shows our complicated relationship with it, and as someone with a complicated relationship with alcohol, I appreciate that. You can have great times with it, or it can be your worst enemy. It’s not bad or good, it just, is.",0
1176,"Watching this also made me miss my buds, can’t wait til we can get back to some form of normal.",0
1177,"The movie has a lot of funny moments intertwined with the drama, I think it’s a good balance. All the cast is great too, but mads really elevates this film. What a talent. That dance number may be one of my favourite scenes of 2020. I do think the movie drags a little at times, and I could have done with less of the mads and his wife subplot.

1178,"It’s hard to talk about this movie without mentioning the tragedy behind it. The director’s daughter died during the filming of it in a car crash. She was even supposed to play a part in the film and the movie is dedicated to her. I can’t even imagine what that must be like, and to finish the film still? Thankful, but I wouldn’t have been surprised if he didn’t.",0
1179,"Dug it though a lot. Very danish, asks a lot of great questions and is still a good time. Cinematography is top notch too, I feel like a lot of these films from Northern Europe have similar vibes, maybe because they can all speak like 9 languages? I don’t know, makes me want to check out Denmark. The drinking age is like 16 there though? Wild.",0
1180,One thing that gets overlooked is Pheonix gives and creates 2 iconic laughs during this performance. ,1
1181,"His laugh he's self inflicted with that comes up when he's distressed (which is amazing, especially how he ends up almost choking on it) and his other psychotic laugh that he forces when he thinks he's meant to be laughing at social cues (even though he doesn't actually know why he's laughing) like at the comedy club and when his co-workers are making fun of the little person.",1
1182,SOO GREAT!,1
1183,"[Edit: my first silver! Thank you kind stranger] One small detail I loved in the death of Thomas and Martha Wayne- her pearls.  Every other time, the ripping off of her pearls has been done out of greed, because they were valuable.  But here, her killer rips them off out of rage and disgust, like ""fuck your ridiculous pearls, you fucking one-percenter."" Loved the fact that the Joker didn’t actually physically kill Bruce’s parents, but still caused their death. Really nice touch. Also really appreciated  how graphic the murders were. They were realistic to the point of being unsettling. ",1
1184,"The film made sure that viewers didn’t want to be the joker. It wiped away any sort of romanticism some people may have about “being crazy.” I always thought that the joker should not be a character people admired, and this film made sure that you didn’t. ",1

1186,“He always seemed... so happy.”,1

1195,"All that topping an already mentally unstable and unmedicated man. The shot of him smiling while his boss is bitching him out about the sign was amazing yet terrifying. I feel like Clowns have to be Bruce Wayne's biggest fear in this universe, so one must assume he actually goes on to become Clownman Just got back from the theatre. ",1
1196,"Hot damn, give Joaquin all those freaking awards NOW—even if he doesn’t like them so much. I mean, supposedly they give those out for *the* best actor and if that wasn’t some fine acting then I don’t know what is.  ",1
1197,"For me, Joaquin the actor disappeared around ten minutes in. He completely embodied this whole new identity throughout the film and when the Joker formally emerged towards the end, I swear to god I lost it. I got teary-eyed during his rant with Murray and even at the end, when he painted a smiley on his face with his own blood. ",1
1198,"Phew, I obviously have a lot to process still. Just...bravo to JP and the whole team behind Joker. Maybe this was mentioned already but did anyone notice the numerical countdown that was in the movie? I noticed the first number (9) as the platform number at the train station where he killed the last of the wall street guys. After that the ones I can remember were 8 for Zazie's apartment, 6 is the train platform when two detectives are chasing him, 4 on the wall behind DeNiro at the studio as he chats to Joker before he goes on, 3 was the camera that was focused on joker during the scene, 2 was one of the news stations reporting the shooting on all the TVs and I think 1 was represented by the ""Ace in the Hole"" billboard in the background after the crash and at the birth of Joker. The best part for me was watching Joker take notes about what other people perceive as funny because he doesn’t have the same associations. That and him immediately ending his laugh when he turned down the hall at work. ""Don't you have to be funny to be a comedian"" got audible gasps in my theater. That chaotic train scene chase was perfect and the best part for me tbh. Perfect example of the joker using chaos to his advantage This is kinda really stupid, but did anyone notice the wicker chair one of the joker protesters was waving around when Joker was on top of the police car at the end? I just kept focusing on the idiot that brought a wicker chair to a riot.. Sure I could believe someone waving a bat, hammer, or something else. There was just someone with a big wicker chair waving that thing around. I thought it was hilarious and wanna know did anyone else notice that? I feel like I haven’t seen Robert DeNiro have so much fun in a long time. He really sealed this film. Watching him and Phoenix verbally spar was glorious. Just wanted to point out, he never eats anything in the film.",1
1199,"Multiple times he is about to eat and then something happens that causes him to get more stressed and he immediately starts smoking a cigarette. If Joaquin Phoenix's shoulder blades don't get an Oscar for this film, why do they even have awards? The scene where he dropped the gun at the hospital had me rolling. And his reaction was just on point. Two things I was very happy about:",1
1200,1. It’s totally unclear whether or not Arthur is Thomas’ son (and Bruce’s half brother),1
1201,2. Arthur/Joker didn’t kill the Wayne’s,1
1202,"I also like that the whole movement he inadvertently becomes the head off, was in fact, created by the media - very meta with (I swear) the media currently almost begging for someone to shoot someone in relation to this film so as to create a narrative . It's ok Arthur, sometimes I imagine that Zazie beetz is my girlfriend too... As soon as the the Wayne family walked out of the theater, I was like ""well shit, here we go again"". Joker was planning on killing himself when he was a guest in Murray's show, right? But he had a change of heart after Murray just made fun of him on live television? One of the primary event which snaps him completely was the fact that he initially wanted to suicide at the live show but because they made fun of even his ""knock, knock"" joke - his last joke which he wanted for himself, made him reaaaally lose it. Anything the Joker does after that fits so perfectly - he doesn't care if he dies, everything seems to be a joke to him. TDK and all other versions fit perfectly post the suicide joke gone wrong. Just love it Joker’s biggest nemesis won’t be Batman. It’ll be lung cancer. ",1
1203,"Edit: Punctuation i felt the reason he was sympathetic towards the midget is because he *understood* him, in the sense that the midget was seen as a joke within his entire presense of the movie, as no one took him seriously because of his height just like how people didn't take arthur seriously because of his mental illness (and his character altogether). ",1
1204,"this is further emphasised by how the midget couldn't reach the door lock, which appeared to be comedic to the audience, but to the joker he saw someone who was forced into a life of hardship with no say of his condition just like joker himself.",1
1205,"BTW if you like this film or other Laika films, check out /r/laika. Really good subreddit in need of subscribers. Kubo *clearly* had three strings on his guitar. *Zero* stars. /s",0
1206,"But on a more serious note, my god was this movie absolutely gorgeous to look at and the soundtrack was amazing. Laika Studios has yet to disappoint me with anything they've put out. ",0
1207,"EDIT: In retrospect, a more fitting comment would have been:",0
1208,>Before watching the movie: *Clearly* that instrument has three strings. *Zero* stars.,0
1209,">After watching the movie: I understand, and I am crying. Real contrast between this movie and the trailers before it. Storks, Sing, etc. all of em just seemed like such obnoxious and low effort excuses for kids entertainment.",0
1210,"I really hope this has some legs. This is the kind of thing a kid will appreciate more and more as he/she get older. A meticulously crafted piece of art that never once talks down to them.  Kubo and the Two Strings is a must watch. The story is deeply embedded in Japanese folklore, borrowing many mythical elements from Japan's cultural roots. The visuals are completely mind blowing. Set design, action sequences, and general cinematography are stunning. At its core, it is an emotional story surrounding the themes of family, mortality, and the passage of memory. ",0
1211,"I cannot recommend this film enough. If any of you are on the fence about seeing this movie, please go see it. Currently, it is tracking to open around $10-15 million. I believe this film deserves a much warmer opening. With a smaller studio like Laika, this movie's success is paramount to ensure they are rewarded for their dedication to stop-motion. There needs to be more Kubos and less minions ""If you must blink, do it now.""",0
1212,"I was so impressed by this movie. From beginning to end it's lovely and beautiful and touching and hilarious and fun and wise and young and old. It was familiar, yet always surprising. Not short, but not long either. At once frightening and also positive.",0
1213,"Maybe the best movie I've seen this year. Highly recommend. I am entirely convinced that, whoever wrote this movie, lost at least one parent to Alzheimer. Memory it's the ultimate weapon in the movie, and loss of memory is a constant theme.  Can I just say Regina Spektor's cover for ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" during the end credits was fucking amazing? [deleted] This movie is not afraid to get dark. Like, even the first 5 minutes.",0
1214,"That's Laika's way. I have to say that was one of, if not the, most beautiful animated movies I've ever seen. The fact that it was stop motion was just mind-blowing. Wow, this movie is officially tied for the highest-rated wide-release movie on Metacritic so far this year (it currently has a score of 83). ",0
1215,"I would *never* have expected ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" and ""The Witch"" to have the 2 highest scores on Metacritic of 2016 in terms of wide-release movies.  Did anyone catch George Takei's character going ""Oh myyyyyy"" towards the beginning? The stop-motion seemed really good here, loved the set pieces. I spent most of the movie wondering why the title was ""Kubo and the *TWO* strings (as the guitar has three strings), but completely understood near the end. Really fantastic. Holy shit that was great! Every line McConaughey had was gold. I was worried I was going to be let down, but it was amazing. I fucking loved it. ",0
1216,"Sadly there was about 12 people total (including me) and that worries me a bit. Other than that, Kubo had me hooked really quickly. That soundtrack was soooooooooo wonderful and everyone of the characters had charm! This is a day one pick up for me once its out on Blu Ray! Everyone please go see this. As movie buffs we need to support films like these financially.  Kubos to Laika. ",0
1217,"I wouldn't say they're the next Pixar, as some have claimed, but I'd certainly see an argument as the next Aardman.",0
1218,"Also, nice to see Art Parkinson show some real zig-to-the-zag abilities this time. Kubo was all-around spectacular, but I just couldn't get one specific thought out of my head: Laika's probably animated the most phenomenal water I've ever seen in any animated medium. I hope this gets Laika their much deserved Oscar. What I absolutely loved was the resolution. Sure we have a sword fight *first*, but then we have forgiveness. The entire town coming together and embracing the Moon King was fantastic. Laika consistently *nails* alternate ways to resolve conflict. Like Paranorman before it, this movie really sells itself on its finale. Sure, the entire thing is amazing, but the ending really sold me on it overall.  This is definitely one of my favorite movies, full stop. ",0
1219,"Not this year, not of animated movies. I adored this film. This movie is absolutely amazing. It feels so alive and full of love, every character really comes to life on-screen. The fact that they all feel so real and alive when all they are is little puppets in a warehouse in Oregon is amazing. I honestly can't even believe stop-motion is a thing that can be this good. The amount of hard work, talent, and dedication needed to pull something like this off is extremely admirable.",0
1220,"But it would be pointless if the story or filmmaking was weak, and again Laika shows that they know what they are doing in that department. Not a single scene or second is wasted here. While it's basic plot is a pretty typical heroes journey, the characters, environments, poetic and gorgeous imagery, and the themes that were explored really elevate it well-beyond feeling anything close to cliche or recycled.",0
1221,"A lot of kids movies have got mile-a-minute storytelling, lots of pop tunes and upbeat music, flashy visuals, and are full of lame, lazy jokes. While some movies like that are decent and enjoyable, it was so great to see an animated ""kids"" movie that really respected the entire audience. While there are a lot of great jokes, action scenes, and it moves pretty quickly Kubo is a movie that isn't afraid to go to some dark places, or give some time to let the emotional scenes sink in. The kids in my audience were into it.",0
1222,"While some will write it off just because it's an animated movie, I think there really are some genuinely thoughtful and touching ideas explored here. The power and importance of storytelling, the nature of memory and loss, and even life and death are all touched upon and included in a natural and fitting way. I think this film has more on it's mind that a lot of adult dramas I've seen recently.",0
1223,"This movie has better action scenes and more imagination than any other big action blockbuster I've seen this year. I'm not sure what kind of research went into this, but it felt like an authentic portrayal of Asian culture, and made me want to learn more about it. ",0
1224,"I also loved how there weren't any exposition dumps about Kubo or his mother and their magic. He just played his instrument and the paper came to life. It was a confident and bold decision to introduce us and say ""yeah, he's magic, here's what he does, now let's get on with it."" Bold and confident are both adjectives I'd use to describe the film as a whole. The film had a very clear and unique sense of identity and purpose, and kept consistent the whole way through.",0
1225,"There are so many images in here that will be burned into my memory, particularly that scene where Kubo was underwater and there were all those giant eyes staring at him. This is one of the most gorgeous movies I've seen in so long, and I can't wait to see it again. Even the 3D was utilized well, something that I usually hate.",0
1226,"If I ever have kids, this will be a movie that I cannot wait to show them. I loved and adored everything about it. This is about as close to a perfect movie as you can get. My favorite of this year so far. ",0
1227," What a wonderful film! I took my 5 y.o. Son to see this and there were so many moments in the movie that parallel my time with my son. Kubo and his dad playing ""I Spy"", Hanzo teaching Kubo how to aim a bow and arrow (I just bought my son a slingshot and we practice his aiming). I have been waiting for a movie like this all year that we can both enjoy because ""Dory"" and ""Secret Life of Pets"" were both good but neither gave me that uplifting feeling this movie gave me.  Mostly, I just wish this movie was 40 minutes longer. The creation/animation of this movie is a triumph, but honestly, it doesn't earn a lot of it's major plot points. It probably would have delayed the movie's already long production time, but I would have loved to sit with and learn about the key characters longer than we did.",0
1228,"Something that stood out for me that people haven’t mentioned was the sound work, really created an atmosphere of the woods despite being on a tv in my living room, and also the score was beautiful. Finally! I’m so glad I found the discussion thread for this movie, because this is by far one of my favorite animated movies ever.",0
1229,"The scene when Robyn first ran with Meph after turning into a wolf was by far one of the most beautifully animated scenes I’ve seen in a long time. The color, the shadows and the fluid movement of the wolves were all just eye candy for animation lovers. ",0
1230,"But my favorite part? After the Lord Protector commits suicide and Goodfellowe, Meph, her mother, and Robyn were all in the carriage driving away, the Lord Protector’s own horse was pulling them. I just love how they adopted him, a really cool detail in my opinion.",0
1231,"Go see this film now. It’s amazing. This was pretty great and contains some really beautiful imagery. Really surprised to see British colonialism in Ireland (something that I feel like is not depicted a lot in mainstream British media) dealt with in a kids film. I don't think a prettier hand-drawn film exists anywhere on the planet right now. Those scenes with the wolf vision must have taken so much work to draw, and it's easy to imagine a CGI film just using some fancy filter if faced with the same challenge. Using rough line-work to characterize is also such a dang genius touch.",0
1232,"I really wish the script were tighter, and honestly all the Cartoon Saloon movies I've seen before kind of suffer from this, with some emotional moments going on for too long. The Goodfellowes especially make some, hmmm, questionable decisions that seem more tailored to drive the drama forward than to make sense, and their arcs aren't as elegant as the artwork - they come around on the whole ""being a pagan werewolf"" thing pretty dang fast.",0
1233,"I wonder where Cartoon Saloon will go next, if there's still any more stories they can set in Ireland when they've already covered a lot of their mythologies. The Kells artstyle is practically signature at this point, but it's hard to imagine it working well in any other setting. Still, I am super glad that they're still making such quality works a decade after Secret of Kells. Stunningly gorgeous and very emotional. After having seen this and Song of the Sea, I really need to get around to watching Cartoon Saloon's other movies. Watched it tonight with my folks for our weekly movie night. I was blown away by this film. The scene where Robyn was learning to be a wolf had me grinning from ear-to-ear. Very likable characters, especially Mebh. I don’t often say a movie is a must-see, but this one truly is. Bravo Cartoon Saloon, bravo. in addition to the animation, the 2 girl voice actors were SO good. i was tearing up when robyn was crying and pleading at the end in the forest. so heartbreaking. The whole sequence with Aurora's ""Running with the Wolves"" was soooo good. I love how Cartoon Saloon deals with their animations, it's always innovative, fresh and inspiring to watch! Really glad to see them embrace 2D animation like this after Disney gave up on it. I love every creative decision they made in this movie. It's *chef's kiss. If '**Pixar's Soul**' wasn't coming out, this film would have won the Oscar easily, but we know how this works.",0
1234,"Mebh is the most lovable rascal since Toph. I am saddened by the fact that I never ended up redeeming the year of Apple TV+ that I would have gotten with my iPad purchase back in the first half of the year, solely because it means I am missing out on this movie. I know this I'm a little late with this comment, but there is so much beauty in Wolfwalkers I couldn't help it.",0
1235,( Caution: Geeky rant ahead),0
1236,"For instance, I love the art style so much. The detail in the different settings is astounding, and Cartoon Saloon's stylized way of showing depth is one of my favorites in animation. The character's fluid designs are nothing to scoff at either. Im so glad that they stuck to a more traditional style, especially because sometimes you can still see the sketch lines used for the bases. It's great if you're just learning how to animate since all of the prep is still there. It makes the animation feel raw, which I like a lot. ",0
1237,"Let's not forget the characters themselves. I know that some people see them as a bit one dimensional,  but I don't see that way at all. Robyn and Mebh are young, which is why I consider there personalities to be constantly developing, that also means they won't recognize more complex emotions yet. ",0
1238,"For Robyn, shes trying to continue as she was in England, and finding out that's not possible anymore. Over the course of the story, we get to see her grow stronger, and learn new emotions. Namely, fear, loss of freedom, courage, and new perspective.",0
1239,"In Mebh's case, she's learning to live without a parental figure and likely has feelings of abandonment. When robyn comes around she doesn't feel so alone, which she one of the reasons she feels so betrayed when Robyn asks her to ""Take Merlin and go."". In a way, Mebh likely thinks Robyn is leaving her too.",0
1240,"I really loved Robyn's father too. He has a very real fear that the world could turn on him, and cautions Robyn from being reckless. He's actually one of the very few parental figures that feel real to me. Many parental characters in children's films bother me, because they don't seem to care that their child (often the protagonist) nearly got themselves killed. It's borderline negligent. Unlike many animated parents, Goodfellow is a responsible adult doesn't expect his daughter to fix his problems. ",0
1241,"I wish there was more screen time for Mebh's mother so there was more to analyze, but there's still plenty to talk about. For instance, she is an enigma throughout the story, which pushes the plot forward. She also is a caring parent, which makes two good parents for the win!",0
1242,"Anyways, I'm done typing for now.",0
1243,"[ EDIT ] I got too excited and forgot how english worked. Absolutely gorgeous and lives up to the hype. The animation here is stunning. What they do with shadows is one of my favorite things I've seen all year. I was looking forward to seeing this in a theater but with everything going on, I'm just happy that I was able to watch it at all. With it being on Apple+ I feel like it's going to go overlooked. Paganism=1",0
1244,"Christianity=0 Loved it! I was seriously impressed with Sean Bean's voice acting as well, the range of emotion he showed was spot on throughout the film. And aside from being beautiful some of the framing and transitions were so gorgeous. And it was super funny too. This is the best animated film of 2020, without a doubt. Might be my favorite animated film of all-time. Just so so good. ""WolfWalkers"" was breathtaking in every way. Ever see a film and wish you could watch it for the very first time all over again? This film is mine. One of the best movie experiences I have had in a long time. (Now, if only we had a DVD or Blu-Ray release to throw money at!) ❤️ 🐺 The animation is like a moving childrens storybook, that along with the music and general warmth of the story make for some incredibly heartwarming sequences. This is a great film that went under the rader last year. Question about Box Office. I heard that it has budget of 10-20 million $ (unconfirmed).  ",0
1245,"And Wolfwalkers box office is like 230000$. Maybe they earned much more through Apple TV or smth? Just want to know if they lost money with such great movie. Fantastic movie! World building, animation, art style, score, casting/voice acting, setting, atmosphere are all on point. Easily my favorite of the year and I managed to see it twice in theaters. What a great movie!  But the whole movie I kept thinking ""If any of these charachters die I will turn this movie off and give it 0/5 stars.""  And so when everyone lived happily ever after the release of dramatic tension was orgasmic.  ",0
1246,"And I love the examination of Irish-English history and colonialism.  In fact, the whole movie was dripping with so much metaphor I loved how much it gave me to think about. SPOILER ALERT",0
1247,Good film.,0
1248,"Not bad, but not great. IMPO I think Cartoon Saloon's strongest films are Song Of the Sea and The Breadwinner.",0
1249,Strengths.,0
1250,Art. every shot...*chefs kiss* every shot is like a desktop wallpaper for me.,0
1251,"Characters. Robyn, Mebh, and Bill(father) play their expected roles. A wannabe hunter, a feral defensive child, and an overprotective fearful dad. But what makes them better than archetypes, is that they play their archetypes stories differently. Mebh is curious, playful, and yet defensive about her mother. Robyn wants to be a wolf hunter, but abandons it, society, and her father to be a Wolfwalker in the woods. Overprotective father, instead of rage being a usual depiction of this from a male parent. We see Father, actually be crippled in fear by Lord protector, and is on the verge of tears when Robyn is crying about being forbidden to leave or do anything other than what Lord protector or what he says.",0
1252,"Themes of fear. Initially, wolves/forest/nature are to be feared in the beginning of the film, but as our character Robyn spends time with Mebh and becomes a Wolfwalker she learns that its more freeing to leave society, and makes the painful decision to leave her father, with her sleeping body (emotional scene). And later her Father leaves society too.",0
1253,Interesting points.,0
1254,"The thing I enjoy about having Father and Robyn be English, is that they are not completely welcomed in Ireland during the setting of the film(colonialism), and Father works for Lord Protector. The Irish dont bother to hide thier disdain/hate for Lord Protector, but follow his orders due to severe punishment and fear. So in a sense Robyn and Father become ""Irish"" at the end of the film by fighting Lord Protector, and going away with Mebh and her Mother, and embracing the Wolfwalker way.",0
1255,"I found the ending bittersweet, cause while the setting is historical (but not completely). Ireland's native wolves have been extinct, cause of the real Lord Protector. So...while at this point of time in the film the Wolfwalkers succeed, we know they dont cause wolves will be gone from Ireland.",0
1256,Weakness.,0
1257,Too simple.,0
1258,"""Girl finds nature side, and embraces/leaves society.""",0
1259,That pretty much sums up the movie.,0
1260,"Father: while I understand Father is overprotective because he is a father, we dont see why he is at that extent. And If anything Father's choice to become a Wolfwalker (I say choice, cause of his choice to leave society. Not on attacking Lord protector,  because any good parent would fight to the death against anyone trying to kill their child) is fueled by his over protectiveness to Robyn. So... idk on how to feel about that. Loved this movie. The animation was so beautiful. I’d like to know more about the cultural history. Did it more or less portray the time period accurately? The art style was so amazing! Very refreshing to see a non-3D animation not from Japan. Robyn and Mebg were both likable, and their voice acting were also great. ",0
1261,"My only problem with it was Robyn’s father’s character. I knew that Robyn would eventually have to confront him and convince him that Wolves are not evil, but his character felt way too stubborn until the very end. I think it would have been better to see more of a gradual change.",0
1262,"Overall this was a really fun movie with refreshing art style and likeable main characters. I'm a little curious about the decision to only call him ""Lord Protector"". Is the idea to sneak some Irish history over to British viewers without them realising? :D I just saw this last night; glad I found the discussion thread for it.",0
1263,This is my favorite film of the year! Beautiful animation. The voice talent is so good.,0
1264,The scene where Mebg and Robin are running together in the woods made my cry; something about the music and animation together. And then the ending with Mebg mother...oh dear lord.,0
1265,"""She always ate enough food for two."" For a movie that isn't really a horror film, I felt genuine terror from seeing the man climbing the stairs in the kid's story. His eyes are just so white in the dark, and I wanna say you can only hear rain or something. Man, that scene where Mr. Park is just talking about the “smell” of Mr. Kim while he’s hiding under the table was so utterly heartbreaking. The slow zoom on Mr. Kim’s face as he felt entirely ashamed in front of his children absolutely ruined me. Absolute masterpiece. ki-jung/jessica calmly smoking a cigarette on top of the sputtering toilet while the camera moves erratically might be my favorite shot of the year. the stance of utter defeat, wow. might be my favorite character of the year too. Nothing says this is a Bong Joon Ho movie for me as much as the scene where the mom casually kicks the previous house lady down the stairs. It was so instantaneous how my reaction went from giggly at the execution of the kick to horrified the moment the house lady's skull cracked up against the wall.",1
1266,"I absolutely love how he can get different emotions out of you in just a matter of seconds. Upon watching it the second time, I have noticed a small detail which might have escaped the scrutiny of non-Korean audiences:",1
1267,"When Mr. Kim was left in the basement alone with that half-mad former housemaid's husband, the camera shows a bookshelf which is filled with many volumes of legal topics along with a study material to prepare for a police officer exam.",1
1268,"In S. Korea, passing the bar exam to become a judge/prosecutor/attorney is widely considered as one of the few opportunities open for the poor to escape their wretched status. As such, the competition is quite fierce and some people waste many years of their lives preparing for the exam but never succeed in passing.",1
1269,"And when they eventually give up, they usually find themselves in a hopeless situation where they need to compete with much younger people to get a job while they lack any kind of job training or a qualification. It is a well known tale in S. Korea that some of those people lose their mind in the process and live as a social reject or even a beggar.",1
1270,"So, I believe Bong tried to tell a similar tragic life story of the husband in a very condensed manner, with that brief shot which shows their happy honeymoon photograph, then subsequently a bookshelf full of legal volumes, thus implying that he too had lost his mind in his attempt to escape the poverty in his own ways. One of my favorite scenes is when “Mr. Kim” is driving Mrs. Park the day after the torrential rain storm and the flood, and the extreme paradox that is portrayed between how the rain the previous night affected his family and how it affected her family. Mr. Kim is sitting there in the driver seat no doubt thinking about how he has lost all of his personal belongings and she is on the phone talking about how the rain last night has led to such a beautiful day the following day. The way something as simple as rainy weather affects people differently on opposite ends of the social ladder is so devastatingly drastic, for one family it means utter loss and for another it means perfect weather for an impromptu get-together. Surprised no one is talking about the daughter of the rich family and how much she is neglected (emotionally). When the dad arrives home he only calls for the son and has a warm relationship with him, while the only time he refers to the daughter is to remark on how moody she looks. Also the ramen scene shows the mother doesn't really care either, the daughter says something like ""I like ramen too, but when little brother didn't want it, you asked dad and then ate it yourself, you didn't even ask me"". No wonder she latched on to her tutors.",1
1271,"Edit: This is also a contrast to the poor family, where the kids are more or less loved equally (and it’s Jessica who is praised more if anything). I thought the son was for sure done after the rock double tap There are a couple bits during the movie that perhaps non-korean audience members may not immediately understand due to cultural differences. And I want to share more insight into these cultural bits cause I found them fascinating and hilarious! Apologies if these were already said before in the thread, but here’s my go if you’re interested in reading:",1
1272,"1. Fruit is extremely expensive in South Korea that it’s considered a dessert. The wealthy family has an abundance of fruit in the house, where the housekeeper continuously brings fruit to the children when they are tutoring. A box of cherries is around $18 and one watermelon is $20 in Korea to give you a better understanding. You never see the poor family eating fruit, unless it’s in the wealthy house. ",1
1273,"2. The rich mom keeps saying to her friends on the phone to not bring gifts to the party, that they can just come at eat hors d’oeuvres. In fact, she tells her friends 3 different times not to bring gifts, and when the guests arrive, her friend emerges out the taxi with a bunch of gifts and there is a quick shot of the table full on gifts in the backyard. This is customary for Koreans and actually a bit funny. Many Koreans say not to bring gifts, but it is always expected that the guests bring gifts to an event (especially a birthday party). If you don’t bring a gift, it’s considered disrespectful.",1
1274,"3. In the same scene as above, the rich mom tells her friend that since the friend drives a Mini Cooper, they can park it in the garage when they arrive. We even see this happen, as they are backing up the Mini Cooper in the garage and the mom says not to cover the Benz. This is because a Mini Cooper is considered “less high status” and not a luxury car in Korea, so they want to hide it in the garage so other people don’t see the non-luxury car. If you remember throughout the whole movie that many people keep mentioning the Benz (the driver who says ride the Benz instead of the subway, the poor children who ask if the dad ever drove Benz before as a driver, when Ki-woo and his dad are at the Benz store studying the car, the many scenes inside the Benz, and at the end when the rich father yells at the poor father to give him the keys to the Benz). Basically, the Benz car is the best car you can have in Korea to show your wealth and status, so it’s hilarious that the rich family would want to hide the Mini Cooper before the party.",1
1275,"4. Koreans use the app KakaoTalk, not WeChat. In post production, they thought that the non-Korean audiences would recognize WeChat more instantly so they went with that translation/subtitle instead. everyone has said plenty about the incredible storytelling and acting mastery in the movie, but what has stuck with me the most are the beautifully shot frames that make the set pieces and characters truly feel alive through the screen. my favorite shots:",1
1276,"- the way that the half basement and its neighborhood are shot so cramped and narrow! i didn’t even realize that i was feeling claustrophobic until we finally got those wide sweeping shots of the spacious Park home and yard, and felt a physical relief ",1
1277,"- the way that the Park living room garden window fit and filled the movie screen perfectly in most of the shots in that room, compared to the shots of the Kim half-underground street window in which the camera angle was distinctly underground and the view of outside was much less clear ",1
1278,- the slow-motion shot of ki taek and ki woo throwing water at the drunk pissing outside their window,1
1279,- the flashback scene of the older couple dancing in the sunlight in the Park living room ,1
1280,- the shot of the “ghost” ascending the kitchen staircase and emerging from the darkness ,1
1281,"- the entire sequence in which the 3 Kims scatter out of the house (like cockroaches) and take an endless journey down the hillside to their street level neighborhood is impeccably composed, with both the rain and the screen becoming increasingly more chaotic as they descend through what seems like a slideshow of living paintings, with rain and power lines and streetlights and tunnels all harmonizing and climaxing in the soul-crushing flood scene as we are all reminded of their reality. as they deal with the flood, we see in comparison peaceful shots of the Parks enjoying the rain from the warmth of their own home, and gruesome, desperate shots of a family that is losing even more than the Kims down in the bunker. that was a striking illustration of the idea that for any social class at any time, there are always people doing better and always people doing worse. this sequence will stay with me a very long time ",1
1282,- connected to flood sequence but deserving of its own mention: the frame of ki jeong smoking a cigarette on the toilet that won’t stop spewing shit,1
1283,"- the suspense in ki woo’s bunker scuffle, again building claustrophobia in the staircases and corners and tunnels until a moment that he seems momentarily to escape into an open space before our field of vision gets snapped back abruptly",1
1284,"- at the garden party battle, the way that the camera put the viewer right in the middle of the commotion, frantically looking around in every direction at once and barely able to process the chain of events, really added to the believability of ki taek’s snapping point as we felt the adrenaline and mayhem right along with him, jumping to the same conclusions (for me at least, i know this has been a matter of some debate)",1
1285,- the dream sequence in which ki taek walks across the empty living room into the sunlight ,1
1286,"i’m sure i missed some but those are the shots that have stayed with me the most! gorgeous film. Da-song's drawings aren't of a chimpanzee or himself -- it's Geun-sae's face. Two times Mr Kim says to Mr Park ""you love your wife"" and both times he just kind of avoided the statement? What was the significance of this? The first time he just hesitated and said ""... yeah lets call it love"" and the second time he's just like ""look, you're getting paid, just do your job now"".  What's the point/meaning of this? One of my favorite things about this movie is its ability to balance its tone. It manages to go from laugh-out-loud funny to edge-of-your-seat intense in the blink of an eye (or vice versa) without feeling jarring.",1
1287,"Great direction, great writing, great acting, great cinematography, great editing. Hands down one of the best movies of the year. When they were getting drunk in the living room I was so nervous about the family coming back. Then the old housekeeper came back and that was probably worst. Then the family comes back and the situation becomes more tense that I could imagine it. That was such a great turn of events.",1
1288,"The whole movie had me at the edge of my seat. What a great films that tackles so many themes in an unconventional manner. Liked ""Parasite""? Check out ""Burning"", and ""The Handmaiden"".",1
1289,"Edit: ""Burning"" is now on netflix! so many outstanding and unforgettable sequences in this film, but the tuberculosis scene made me laugh so damn hard. Song Kang-ho's expression as he pulls the ""bloody"" tissue out of the trash makes me chuckle just thinking about it. What i loved about Parasite the most is the fact that it's as accessible as it is. You could showcase the thematic angle of the gap between the rich and poor in so many different ways, but Bong found a way to make it extremely fun. The whole first hour or so when the Kims one after another plant themselves into the Park's household with their scheming and tricks is so hilarious and funny, i think basically anyone would enjoy that part on its own.  ",1
1290,"It's also an interesting thought, because essentially it brings up the concept of persona, the kims pretend to be different people and their success solely depends on the act, not so much on their actual qualification or personality (which imo also gets reflected by us not really seeing much of their work and how well they do + the son always wondering if he would fit in with the rich people, being impressed by them seeming so natural at the party).    ",1
1291,"As soon as they actively get rid of the other two workers it also becomes apparent that one of the messages is that the poor fight themselves to be in the best position to get the scraps of the rich, that's even clearer as soon as we find out about the bunker. That messaging is portrayed in such a thriller like finesse that it's simply exciting to watch even if you don't outright find meaning in it instantly. When the Parks come back from the failed camping and push comes to shove to hide evidence of what was going on that evening, i bet most people hold their breath for the Kims even though they are quite flawed people.  ",1
1292,"Not that anyone in this film is purely good or bad though, that's another thing i loved about it. Everyone has their fair share of negative and positive traits, it's not as simple as rich = bad or poor = lazy or any of these common tropes.  ",1
1293,"One more thing, the ending itself. At first i was a little sceptical but after thinking about it a bit i find it fits extremely well. My reading is basically that Bong says no matter what, you have to play within the system that is capitalism, that's why the son's big plan (who directly goes against his father's 'no plan philosophy') to save his father is the most absurd one quite frankly. Getting rich enough to buy the house. Play within the system, money rules it all. (while implying there is no real chance for him :()    ",1
1294,"Otherwise nothing really can change things (the father having to hide in the bunker of the house, a new rich family already replacing the Kims). It's quite pessimistic and bleak, but i think that's kinda Bong's style when it comes to his critique of society and capitalism. According to Cho Yeo Jeong who plays Mrs. Park, the scholar rock represents ""a shortcut to success"". Not saying that's the definitive interpretation, but it makes a lot of sense. The main character's friend gives it to him along with the referral to the English tutor job. It later backfires (when the rock is dropped on the lead). Later on, he puts it back in the stream, a sign that he's given up on shortcuts to success. Just thought that was an interesting insight from Cho.",1
1295,"There was also interview with Bong Joon-Ho where he said he chose the Native Americans/cowboys theme to show that the Parks & the Kims moved into a house which already had occupants but they would ""take over"". I love love love love how Bong films the house. I have such a good sense of how it’s designed, where everything is, where each room is - I legitimately feel I could draw it from memory. And despite it being the setting for like 75% of the movie, he still finds these ways to keep it visually interesting. Kept itching an architectural part of my brain I didn’t even know I had Did anyone notice how when the Parks come up the stairs it’s always bright because the lights are being turned on for them, but when the poorer people come out of the basement, it’s always out of pitch darkness... interesting and subtle representation of the division between the two classes. Damn, when the doorbell started ringing the entire theater went utterly, dead silent. We were all holding our breaths. Before that moment everyone was just laughing and thoroughly being entertained at Kim family's shenanigans. The actress for the housemaid REALLY stole the scene. How haunting was that shot of ""the monster from the stairs"". People are talking and diving deep into the class separation on why Kim stabbed Park, and while that plays a major factor... I think the biggest piece was Kim's daughter had just been stabbed and Park didn't give a fuck, while he isn't aware of their relation, he is aware that another woman has just been stabbed and all he wants is for him to help his son. That is what made him ""cross the line"" That was so metaphorical!",1
1296,"hey disney, daveed diggs has the perfect weird energy for that pirates of the caribbean reboot you wanna do I’m glad this is the cast that was pro shot because my god they’re all amazing. Especially finally seeing Groff as King George in all his glorious spittle. The man plays evil weasel so well. The show was always worth the insane price, but it’s a blessing to see it essentially for free. ",0
1297,I hope they do this for more musicals. Especially since we have no damn clue  when we’ll get musicals again. Please let there be a pro shot of Book of Mormon that Matt and Trey are sitting on.,0
1298,"Edit: Also, while the songs are beautiful on the soundtrack, seeing “Dear Theodosia”, “It’s Quiet Uptown”, and “Who Dies, Who Lives, Who Tells Your Story” performed fucking wrecked me. Just wonderful. Underrated aspect of having this musical on streaming: Subtitles",0
1299,"I saw this live and enjoyed it. Went home that night, read some of the lyrics and was surprised by some of the songs like “Satisfied”. ",0
1300,"Subtitles 100% helped my enjoyment and I think will assist new watchers to understand the storyline. Welp, four years later I see now why Leslie Odom beat out Lin for the Best Actor Tony. Christopher Jackson is the best actor in this play. ",0
1301,Convince me I'm wrong The motif of Burr waiting for it and Hamilton not wasting his shot through the show reversed in the final duel is still amazing to me everytime I listen and think of the show. I feel like no one's talking about Christopher Jackson's performance as George Washington. His voice is amazing and he steals the show everytime he's on screen. ,0
1302,"Leslie Odom Jr. still the best tho I can’t believe I had to wait 4 years to discover Hercules Mulligan was the flower girl at the wedding. SOUTHERN MOTHER*BLEEPING* DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICANS!

1303,"But then Satisfied comes along and it crushes it ruthlessly, with a dark piece of art.",0
1304,"The whole play is fantastic, start to finish. Not enough people are talking about Renee Elise Goldsberry (Angelica) and her performance of Satisfied. An amazing song that she absolutely crushed. ",0
1305,"Satisfied is the one song that I disliked when I listened to the soundtrack but then loved after seeing it live. “My love, take your time” hits a lot harder when you can see Eliza’s face practically begging him not to go. The single biggest revelation from this for me is the performance of Leslie Odom Jr. I’ve seen the live show twice, listened to the cast album countless times and watched every filmed performance of the original cast I could get my hands on. But it wasn’t until I saw him as Burr that I saw the character as more of a socially awkward man desperate to be loved than just a smooth-talking snake. Lin-Manuel’s lyrics always painted Burr as a complex, nuanced man but Odom brought a depth to him that both surprised and mesmerized me. Two things always stick out to me:",0
1306,"1. In all my life, I will never be a bigger fan of our nation’s first POTUS than when he’s going OFF at the end of “One Last Time.”",0
1307,"2. The way the story of “Helpless” morphs into the story of “Satisfied” is *chef’s kiss* The beginning of Dear Theodosia when its just Leslie Odom Jr. singing against a completely black backdrop was fantastic. the more I watch the musical, the more I think the Bullet is criminally underrated throughout. ",0
1308,"also I forgot how *steamy* Say No to This gets on-stage. How is nobody complementing Renee Angelica Goldsberry!? I thought she was magical, but perhaps eclipsed by Jonathan George Groff and later on, by the beloved braggadocio Daveed Jeffersondiggs. That’s how good each character was written and enacted! >After Credits Scene? No",0
1309,"Aww, I was hoping Fury would show up. Wasn't a huge fan of Anthony Ramos on the album, not sure why in hindsight, but he blows me away on the stage. Whoever's in control of that rotating stage is MVP. Never listened to the soundtrack because I wanted to experience it for the first time when actually seeing the show. Amazing, even though it’s less than ideal to watch it this way. Eliza’s ending was so moving, I couldn’t get the lump out of my throat for quite a while after that The Room Where it Happens/Cabinet Battle/Washington on Your Side/One Last Time streak is the real highlight of the show. All incredible songs and Christopher Jackson’s passion at the end of One Last Time was unmatched. The shot during Hurricane with all the furniture up around him was incredible It’s great, but the context is greater. Here we are mostly stuck at home for the 4th of July in the middle of a pandemic and tremendous racial unrest and what do we get? The story of hopeful people fighting for a country, told by hopeful people who still to this day line the streets in face masks to fight for a better version of that country.",0
1310,I can’t think of nearly anything as patriotic.,0
1311,"Went in expecting Jon Bernthal to be like the head bad guy or some shit. He absolutely killed it in his little part and I felt for him so much. He died fighting and even though it wasn't enough, it shows just how genuine/good his character was. When they reveal Natalie(?) is dating an older guy I ultimately assumed he was a manipulative asshole. I was wrong and now my heart hurts. The ""WHY ARE YOU FLANKING ME?"" Mexican standoff was awesome.  How good was the reveal of Jon Bernthal? When we think he's the Pete character, and then he opens the door and we realize it's a flashback. That was a small moment that was perfectly executed from a writing and directing standpoint.  The tension building up when they visit the oil rig followed by the shootout... holy shit.",0
1312,"Really good film overall. Loving all of Taylor Sheridan's work so far. He really nails the modern western feel, even when he is trying something different - like a thriller set in the Winds.",0
1313,"The dialogue was a little over the top with the whole ""we are in wyoming"" thing but it didnt really bother me.",0
1314,Fantastic acting all around.            Really solid crime story here. Very smartly written; all the performances were great. Especially Elizabeth Olsen. Probably her best performance since *Martha Marcy May Marlene*. ,0
1315,"Taylor Sheridan has written three great movies and this was a very strong directorial debut. I can't wait to see what's next for him, because thus far he's been killing it. ",0
1316,"I'm really glad they didn't go the serial killer route. It was just a terrible set of circumstances and some downright evil decisions made by some drunk guys. Nothing premeditated, no connection to the death of Jeremy Renner's daughter, no super creepy killer who stalks the police, just a really sad and fucked up situation. I absolutely love the way he handled the reveal of what actually happened to Matt and Natalie.",0
1317,"Cutting away from Jane knocking at the door to go to the flashback, where you see the awful things that happened within those sleeping quarters.  The tension building up as you watch that flashback and know that Jane is walking right into a trap, and then cutting back to the present where you're extremely on edge because you know something awful is about to happen.",0
1318,"That whole sequence was perfect.    They really made James Jordan (Pete) look like a completely depraved, disgusting, and pathetic man. Jon Bernthal showing why he's best for the punisher role. Solid flick. This man sure knows how to build suspense. The border scene in Sicario and the ""flanking"" scene in this? Wonder what he could do with a horror movie. ",0
1319,"Anyway, it was cool to see the twist play out with the boyfriend actually turning out to be a good guy. I'd highly recommend this movie. Reminded me of Prisoners just a lot shorter.  Goddamn, that shootout was the most satisfying I have ever seen in my entire life. He just annihilated them! ",0
1320,"Any idea what caliber his rifle was? Got back from this an hour ago and it's one of the best films of the year. Everything from the acting to the characterization to the dialogue to the cinematography to the tension to the atmosphere works perfectly. Another home run from Taylor Sheridan. I actually went to watch this yesterday(& Logan Lucky tonight) and man... this was a solid flick.  It felt like part-thriller & part-drama with a few dark moments here and there but strong acting, dialogue and overall storytelling.  ",0
1321,"- The line that hit me the most was Cory's ""Steer from the pain"" speech.  Even though I've never experienced the pain of loss myself, that talk he gave to Natalie's father hit me hard and I started to tear up right in the middle of that scene.  ",0
1322,"- Renner and Olsen did really well.  She really sold it as the rookie agent and Renner played the hell out of the silent, level-headed, badass game-hunter.",0
1323,"- A very satisfying conclusion seeing those assholes getting snuffed by Cory and helping find justice and answers for Natalie, even if it meant sacrificing him finding closure for Emily.",0
1324,It's sad to see the turnout was so low and that only two theaters(not just in my city but my whole area) were playing this film.  This is definitely worth a viewing and Taylor Sheridan deserves more work.. Very well made. Wasn't really sure what to expect from Sheridan's directorial debut but this movie really blew me away. The screenplay was top notch as usual and he was able to build some great tension during the action scenes and even during simple conversations. The cinematography is also very beautiful with a lot of landscape shots. ,0
1325,This is a career best performance from Elizabeth Olsen and one of Jeremy Renner's best over the last few years. ,0
1326,"I also appreciated how some of the darker aspects of this situation weren't shied away from and the character's actions did have consequences. Since this is the last movie in his unofficial western trilogy, Sheridan is going out on a very high note. ",0
1327,"I still can't believe the cop from Sons of Anarchy is directing movies now.  All I have to say is wow. I'm going to be recommending this movie to a lot of people. Fantastic performances from Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olson, Graham Greene was great as always, and while I always love Gil Birmingham he went above and beyond. His scenes were very emotional and I really felt his pain.",0
1328,"The cinematography was phenomenal as well. I can't say enough good things about this movie. I don't think I've ever experienced tension as I did in the climax of this movie. I just clenched my chest with my fingers harder and harder, and couldn't let go. ",0
1329,"I love the kind of modern western theme Sheridan went for in his last two movies, and I love how he uses political and social climate in the US as a setting for the movies, as reasons for the conflict. The atmosphere and structure/pacing seem to be his strongest abilities.",0
1330,"Also, holy shit, Olsen and Renner. Between this mediocre blockbuster and that mediocre blockbuster, I forgot these people can act. They just blew me away with their performances (especially Renner).",0
1331,"A stunning achievement of a debut. Man, there was some cool editing in this movie!! I love when Cory stomping on the guy's face outside the trailer cuts into Jane kicking in the door. I also really loved the first person perspective after she was maced.",0

1333,"I hadn't seen a single trailer for this film before I saw it and decided to see it because I liked Hell or High Water and it seemed like a great story. Ended up being one of the best movies I've seen all year. How the fuck is this movie not getting a bigger release? Sicario was an amazing film and Hell or High Water was nominated for Best Picture. The third film of this brilliant trilogy is getting a very slow limited release. This film is hopefully going to get a buzz like Hell or High Water. I don't get why studios would bury this film in the dreck of summer rather than in fall. This movie is almost guaranteed a Screenwriting nomination. The way that the cabin scene was introduced (Matt opening the door to let Natalie in, when you thought you would see Olsen's character) was amazingly clever and a surprise to me. Excellent editing.  Turns out Sheridan can direct a hell of a shootout. I loved this film. My take: if you were looking for a mystery/thriller film, you probably ended up disappointed, as it was a pretty straight forward story that lacked intensity, save for a scene or two. However, I thought the film did an incredible job of using a run of the mill double homicide as a vehicle to transport its central themes: the static and trapped life on a Native American Reservation and how suffering is the best way to acknowledge loss. Every character touched my the central conflict in the story showed these themes in some way, but you really just needed to see the final scene to get the essence of the film. ",0
1334,"[When Jeremy Renner turns to the father and says ""I'm going nowhere"" or something to that affect he really got at the crux of the film: the people on this reservation are stuck, both in their traditions, lack of social mobility, and physical distance from the outside world.

Interested to hear if others found it as powerful. this movie gave me a revenge boner Can someone tell me...when Cory saw the tracks leading to Matt from the drug house...who left them. nobody has mentioned how well they choreographed the slow escalation of the fight/rape scene. each person kept escalating until it turned into a full out melee Gil Birmingham was fantastic in his smaller role. I'm starting to love this guy. I didn't really know him before Hell or Highwater (where he was hilarious). Started watching House of Cards last week and I was pleased to see him in season two. Then he makes me weep like a baby at the end of Wind River. Anyone have any recommendations for projects he's in? Absolutely loved it. Favorite movie of the year. Renner's ex-wife was a little too stoic for her part, but loved everyone else. Wasn't expecting Bernthal's character to actually be a good guy, but as soon as the other guys came back it was pretty obvious what was going to happen to her. He sure put up a hell of a fight though. Renner nailed his part too . I would say all of Sheridan's 3 movies are probably my favorites of the years they came out.",0

Even her birth mother sensed that something was not right with her daughter. She sensed that there was something lurking inside her - something not Christian, something sinful.",0
1352,"Susie continued to age, obsessing over Berlin and the dance academy until finally, she decided to go.",0
1353,"While at the School, Susie began to sense something - someone - inside of her. The magic and ritual taking place around her (and to her) started to awaken Mother Suspiriorum's spirit. Several times, Susie mentioned that she felt someone was with her, or inside of her.",0
1354,"After some wild, vivid nightmares, Susie awakened in the dead of night screaming 'I know who I am!""",0
1355,"From this moment onwards, she became sure of herself. She started speaking with Madame Blanc telepathically and was becoming more and more in tune with the occult.",0
1356,"Finally, at the black mass, she was given the final chance to go back and have her memory erased (Madame Blanc even said this to her), but she chose to move forward with the ritual and fully awaken Mother Suspiriorum inside of her. Until this point, the spirit (or soul) of Susie and the spirit of Mother Suspiriorum were both inhabiting her body simultaneously.",0
1357,"In order for the ritual to be complete, Susie had to embrace one mother and abandon the other. She chose to reject her birth mother, and in doing so she literally gave her soul to Mother Suspiriorum.",0
1358,"Subsequently, Mother Suspiriorum was the dominant spirit (perhaps the only spirit) inside of Susie's body. The ritual was complete.",0
1359,"To seal the deal, Mother Suspiriorum killed all the false mothers that remained. (""Death to all other mothers!"") This included retroactively killing Susie's birth mother, as well as killing all the witches in the coven that were idolising Markos instead of her. ""They'll hollow me out and eat my cunt on a plate.""",0
1360,"Oh There is a conversation between Suzie and Blanc about the jumping, Suzie's instincts telling her to stay on the ground.  Blanc demands the jumps, accusing Suzie of ""confusing weakness for artistic preference."" Suzie makes an argument that by staying low through the performance that the sudden contrast when she jumps at the end will have much more impact. Am I crazy to think this relates very closely to filmmakers choice of an autumnal, muted color palette, ci tasting g so much from the original also famous vibrancy? The controlledd, muted and long shots five way to the bright red stuttered nightmare of the ritual and it is indeed a jarring break. The biggest shock of the movie was finding out that Tilda Swinton played three fucking roles in it.  Fuck me up, Tilda.  Not gonna lie, the bit when they're cleaning up after the climax and one of the ladies pulls back Madame Blanc's head and Tilda suddenly breathes and becomes conscious again was really funny. Between this, Hereditary, and Mandy  this year - I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a wave of downright bathsit crazy cinema in mainstream movie theaters in my life.",0
1361,"Those last 30 minutes are beyond your normal hack and slash, that was some artistic, dark and demonic as all fuck shit. I legit felt dirty walking out of the theater. Ok, the only question I have is why was Mother Markos wearing those shades? The performance in those beady red dresses. Wow. The cuts, the sound, the pace of that scene left me breathless! Underrated creep scene: anyone find that scene where Olga is walking down the stairs and the lady smiles at her to be highly disturbing? Jesus. I’m trying to find a scene or screenshot of that online because I have to relive the horror. Lol. ",0
1362,"Also, does Caroline have anything going on with her or is that just a normal seizure?",0
1363,"And in regards to the first half of my post, because of that scene and a couple of others, do the other dancers know what’s going on there? Saw this the other night. I really liked the original Suspiria and I knew this was an entirely different movie so I went in with an open mind. I love the slow burn of this movie, made me want to pay attention to every detail. A lot of comments here give me the idea that the music by Yorke was polarizing and unfitting, especially in the climax. I personally find Radiohead irritating but I really liked the music here, I found it very engaging especially in the climax. ",0
1364,"The scene with Olga getting totally bent out of shape (understatement) was really well done and horrific, it was this scene that made me afraid that the movie was going to be 2 hours of a ridiculous male fantasy that feels girls getting tortured is somehow deep or edgy, but my fears were dispelled later on. ",0
1365,"The Act 6 climax is totally bonkers and unreal which is what I was hoping to see. A complaint I see is that it looked a little cheesy with the blood effects, and I agree. A little complaint I have is the blocking in this scene: Markos is there, watching over the ritual as Suzie steps in. But I felt really bothered that despite being the top matriarch in the coven, Markos was just kinda like, smooshed into the corner of the scene. I feel like, stylistically, she should have been on some kind of throne or SOMETHING to center her in the scene. This was done quite well with Suzie being revealed as Mother Suspiriorum, but when her spectre of Death comes out and kills Markos, the shots and blocking are really kind of awkward. Like, Death has this totally creepy reveal, but she struts up to Markos who is still in this dumb little corner of the room. Then Death's back is to the camera, and I don't really know how to explain but the positioning of the characters here really bothered me. Felt really awkward. ",0
1366,"That was long winded. I really liked the movie overall though and might see it again! Slight detail: Suzie's mother has heavy, labored breathing and I was reminded of how Markos in the original Suspiria film also had heavy breathing while she slept. Maybe that was a purposeful thing this film did to try and connect Markos to Suzie's mother? Just an interesting little detail that some might pick up. Or maybe I'm wrong, haha. I don’t get the middling reception on Rotten Tomatoes. This is one of the best films of the year in my opinion, and is a perfect companion piece to the original. Where the original was primarily an experience on a sensory level, this film added much more substance, and played more viscerally with the perverted fairy tale like atmosphere of the story. I’m really excited to see the film again. The dance sequence was absolutely mesmerising. Seeing Sara join the dance later in such a robotic and completely bewiiched way really sold how dangerous and arcane the coven was. The last thirty what-the-fuck minutes was probably one of the most bizarre cinema experiences I’ve ever had.  I actually find mia goth really attractive just wanted to say that.  I totally understand the hate, but I enjoy this movie very much. Shocking and unapologetic, Luca once again gave us a period piece. Using his distinct style to transport the audience to the atmosphere of his movie once again, Luca left us in a dark, cold, and brutal Germany only to add to that chilling finale act. I would say this surpasses the original in term of theme and story line.  Luca...like...what the fuck man Anyone know why that lady stabbed her self in the neck? Trying to figure that out.  In the original, Markos is Mother Suspiriorum and is killed by Susie. In this version, Susie is Mother Suspiriorum and survives the film. The film also deliberately mentions the other two Mothers. Hopefully there's more planned for this franchise! ",0
1367,"The climax of *Inferno*, the 2nd in Argento's original trilogy, bears a strong similarity to the climax in this film in regard to the appearance of ""Death Personified"". Looks like Guadagnino did his homework when studying the Argento films.  There's a lot here to like. Tilda is MVP as she always is, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the dance sequences are electric. Luca did an incredible job of maintaining an unsettling atmosphere the whole way through without resorting to cheap tricks. ",0
1368,"But it's also somewhat overlong, and maybe treads the line between ""intentionally mysterious"" and ""unintentionally incomprehensible"" a bit too closely. I'm unsure yet if the positives outweigh the negatives - I couldn't stop mulling it over on the drive home, though, which is usually a good sign. ",0
1369,"I liked Thom Yorke's score less than I was hoping to, and enjoyed Dakota Johnson more than I was expecting to. Usually I find her blank, but here Luca was able to make that quality read as inscrutable. She should play characters like this more often.  I love how the director kept the campy horror movie pan shots and the cheesy blood and whatnot and still managed to maintain the unsettling vibe.",0
1370,"I'll also go against the grain and say that I LOVE the music, and think it was done well. Thom's familiar warm voice was like something holding me down from being so on edge about the gore (I also watched this in an empty theater at midnight, so I may have been more scared than most :P). He also wrote the other music for the movie (eg. title track and volk) which are undoubtedly on-tone. Hey friends, just got back from seeing Suspiria for the third time and wanted to share some wild little details I finally picked up and haven't seen anyone else notice yet.  ",0
1371,"1. At the very beginning, the patient Dr. Klemperer shows in to his office after Patricia leaves is named Mr. Berger. In ""A Sliced Pear,"" Suspiria tells Klemperer the man who killed his wife at the concentration camp was named Mr. Berger",0
1372,"2. In the final shot as it zooms in on the heart carving, a passerby calls to their friend (in German, with no subtitles) ""Come on, Lutz."" Lutz is the name of the man who plays Klemperer (whom Tilda Swinton plays)",0
1373,"3. At the Volk performance, it is Blanc possessing Sarah to make her dance. You can tell because, among other things, Sarah's eyes are replaced with Blanc's (I've seen this mentioned, except people mistakenly say Sarah and Susie change eye colors. No, Susie's remain the same, and you can see short shota of Blanc performing the movements on the side). Coolest thing about this insight is rewatching the scene as Blanc dancing with Susie through Sarah's body, having that intimate moment, and Susie is definitely aware of it. EDIT: I was mistaken, Susie's eyes DO change. But my point about it being Blanc dancing still stands",0
1374,"4. Madam Tanner has a purse around her neck in one of the rehearsals, which she strokes absentmindedly. It appears to be made of black hair if you look closely...",0
1375,"5. As Klemperer leaves the police office, but turns to thank the officer for his help with his search for Anke, the officer grabs/readjusts his balls.",0
1376,"6. Hard to state this succinctly, I have said more about it in other comments on here, but essentially the witches are communicating telepathically and seeing through walls into other rooms the entire movie, and you probably didn't realize on a first watch through because your brain explains it as film conventions. It's only once you know the witches can do this, after the Blanc and Susie telepathy scene, that you would notice it's been going on right in front of us the whole time.",0
1377,"7. Second time at the Paris cafe, look above and behind Blanc's head, on the wall. There's just this rubber arm on a spring bouncing up and down the whole time. It's really creepy but also hilarious? I couldn't help it, i laughed out loud when I saw it, very awkward in a theater of people who with good reason weren't checking out the wall decore in that sexy stare down scene.",0
1378,"8. Fun to pay more attention to on multiple watches: suicidal witch's character progression (you can start to get a pretty clear sense why she kills herself), foreshadowing of Susie being Suspiria in just some of the little things she says and even her way of saying things-- totally confident and at home, all the less prominent witches (each actually has a distinctive character built up through the course of the film, and you can see the hierarchy even if you didn't have Patricia's drawing to lay it out)",0
1379,"That's all I got from memory without my notes in front of me, but if anyone else is as rabidly in love with this film and wants to go over details and analysis hit me up! I saw the movie last night, and I can't really get it out of my mind. I'm torn between my love for certain sections on the film, and my severe distastes for other parts...   ",0
1380,**Things I loved:**  ,0
1381,Volk:  ,0
1382,"The dance scene was by far, the most engrossing part of the movie. The choreography was fantastic, all of the movements were so raw and beautiful at the same time--contrary to Madame Blanc's insistance on dance *not* being beautiful. Moreover, the cinematography in the scene--specifically the overhead shots--were sublime. Those shots--and the alternate angles in general--added to the ritualistic/fantastique nature of the dance, I loved it. Kudos to Dakota Johnson and Mia Goth here, so captivating. And shout out to Thom Yorke--'*Volk*' was the perfect companion to the scene. The synths reminded me of Morton Subotnik's *Silver Apples Of The Moon* and I think that was a conscious choice on Thom's behalf, in that like Subotnik's work, *Volk* is alien, supernatural, and beautifully atmospheric. So great. A perfect scene. Definitely the highlight of the film for me. ",0
1383,Acts II - V:  ,0
1384,"I dunno about the whole 6 act structure + epilogue, but that's beside the point. From acts II - V I was completely glued to my seat. This is the core of the movie, and in it you'll find all of it's best parts. Aside from the Volk scene mentioned, another that sticks out as many others have liked to point out is Olga's torture. Super gruesome, and it wouldn't let you look away. Loved it. Another--when Sara explores the Witch's hideout. The lack of sound and feeling of impending doom kept me on edge. The camera movements reminded me a lot of David Lynch's *Mulholland Drive*, especially how the camera cautiously and slowly approached each corner.. Definitely made it the most frightening part of the film for me. Speaking of David Lynch, the dream sequences were phenomenal. Very reminscent of the horror films of the early 2000s--think of *The Ring*--with the quick cuts, brief moments of violence, and confusion they create.. The scene where the witches toy with the men is also a point of intrigue. True black comedy in that it is funny and terrifying at the same time. If only the rest of the film kept this balance... ",0
1385,**This that I enjoyed:**     ,0
1386,The Acting:   ,0
1387,"Stellar performances from Dakota Johnson, Mia Goth, Tilda Swinton, Angela Winkler, and most of the supporting cast. Chloe Grace Moretz on the other hand, is one of the most unforgivable aspects of the movie, and a complete miscast. There is absolutely no need to use a big name actor--let alone one who is poor at acting--for the role of Patricia. Double whamy of distraction. She's the single reason why the acting is part of the things I loved about the movie.   ",0
1388, Cinematography:  ,0
1389,"While it wasn't the most original, it was interesting enough to captivate. Subtle little things like adding a slight shake to the Kubrickian zooms were intriguing, and let the audience know that the film is aware of horror tropes, and is gonna mess around with those...     ",0
1390,**The bad:** ,0
1391,The Score:  ,0
1392,"The fault doesn't necessarily lie with the score--albeit it isn't *that* exciting--but rather how it was used. Anytime Thom--who leads one of the world's most popular bands for Christ's sake--sang, was sooo distracting. Using *Unmade* in the climax of the film is such a poor, poor choice. Especially in a scene that is already skewered by poor choices. I really don't understand how Guadagnino thought Thom's song and voice could be anything but a distraction.. Some have said that it made the scene tragic, and surely it might have, if the scene wasn't so stupidely over the top. If the scene had any sort of seriousness then maybe it would've worked... But it didn't. Not for me at least... And it plays right into the biggest flaw of the film: Tone.   ",0
1393,The Tone:  ,0
1394,"This is my biggest gripe with the film. I think this is most evident with the climax of the film. Mother Markos, while presumably frightening to some, looked like nothing more than a slightly spookier version of Jabba the Hut. Not only did people in my theatre laugh each time she spoke, but they also chuckled during parts of the execution of the witches loyal to Markos. Truthfully, I do not blame them. How could you view that scene as anything but goofy? The CGI blood fest was far too over the top. Instead of evoking a sense of doom and disgust, I couldn't help but get angry at how silly it seemed. Perhaps the fault is in showing the gore and *not* leaving it up to the imagination? A sort of double-edged sword where I would be complaining if I didn't see enough blood? Maybe a singular, quick shot of the grotesque violence would have sufficied in making it terrifying? I dunno, it just really rubbed me the wrong way... After the scene, the first line we hear from one of the dancers is along the lines of ""Last night was crazy, I had way too much to drink"", which is comical/absurd, and could've have been sooooo God damn disturbing if the scene before it was so... But no. Similarly, the scene following the madness where Suzie/Suspirium goes to the old man's house... My goodness, where to start. Not only did his whole storyline drag the movie, but they had to finish him! Gosh, the monologue was so melodramatic, so cheesy! The deliberate juxtaposition of horror/serious drama and comedy can work--they do well in the cop scene mentioned above--but Guadagnino absolutely fails here. One moment we are greeted with a witch singing absurdly--as if she were in a JG Wentworth commerical--to prosthetic Jabba the Hut, to CGI'd head explosions, to Tilda Swinton's decapitation becoming a gag, to a soapy monologue about the death of one's lost lover... Muddled. Muddled, unsure, and deeply frustrating are the only words I have to describe this end... It's such a shame too, given how much a deeply enjoyed most of the film. In this way I think it pisses me off even more, because I know that the film COULD HAVE been a masterpiece, but it isn't, and it misses the mark completely...  ",0
1395,**Overall:**  ,0
1396,"I really want to love the film. And at times I definitely did. But the errors in tone really take away from it, and the bottom line is that those errors practically zap away any chance that the film has at being a masterpiece.    ",0

1398,Thoughts on my thoughts?  If Alamo Drafthouse had balls they would offer a Suspiria Pretzel for the film and then bring it out right after the Olga contortions scene.,0
1399,"The first third of Edward's novel is possibly the tensest thing I have seen all year. That opening credits sequence was...something else There are far too little comments in here regarding Michael Shannon. Fucking hilarious. When he was dry heaving, bent over, spit, and said alright I nearly burst out. How strange that the novel portions of the film felt more real than the cold and impersonal ""real life"" parts.",0
1400,"And Michael Shannon is the best. I loved how [Edward got his revenge by publishing a novel that has the potential to be a bestseller, assuming his writing is as suspenseful as what we see onscreen (which, based on how much Susan seems to like the novel after being critical of him in the past, it is). Edward sees money in his future for the first time ever. And he got there by doing the opposite of what Susan told him to do - writing about himself. Meanwhile, Susan's lifestyle is falling apart because of her husband's financial troubles. So now she's stuck with a guy she doesn't love but married (in part) for his money, and that seems to be on the way out. So she's trying to go back to Edward, but he's clearly over her. It's a revenge story within a revenge story.](#spoiler) I just saw this movie yesterday [and have been wondering if it is possible that Edward didn't actually stand Susan up?](#spoiler)",0
1401,If you can bear with me:,0
1402,"The relevance of Susan's perception, and sort of overall take on what happened between her and Edward, take the forefront in this film a number of times.  We see the novel play out for us colored by Susan's personal touch-- we see it in the likenesses of Tony and his wife and daughter's characters.  We see it in the obese women from Susan's art installation, in the setting of the novel outside of the bar.    ",0
1403,"[We then also see that Susan's perception of the relationship is that she had done something really 'brutal' to Edward.  She believes that she's done something very horrible to him. She feels guilty.  She subconsciously is anticipating revenge.  When we see the giant revenge painting at the gallery, it feels like some kind of looming foreshadowing for the story, but then we learn that she purchased the painting herself-- the threat of revenge is only looming in her mind.   She is scaring herself, and then not even realizing she is the one doing it.  We then immediately see her scare the shit out of herself with the jumpscare scene where she imagines Ray is in the baby's room not he phone.  She is on edge.  She is expecting something coming... we see this also when she is reading the novel.  The scenes between the novel, and her real life, often transition through a startle.  But the story itself isn't honestly like, suspenseful in a jumpscare way.](#spoiler)",0
1404,"[The novel itself, is a tale of revenge in a way, but does it actually in the end, tell a story where we feel like anything was gained from the revenge?  Tony doesn't actually seem to Feel the thirst for revenge-- it seems like what he's looking for is closure but it looks like he is expecting it through answers, through a dialogue, he wants to know what happened, he wants the details. We see Tony devastated more than we see him angry or vengeful.  His detective friends seems to seek justice--but his character, while coming off on the surface as in control and masculine, is basically emasculated by his illness.  What we do see of Revenge in the novel, is embodied in a character that when it comes down to it is weak, absent, and vomiting when Tony is in the room with the two men who devastated his life. He's doesn't seem driven by revenge--we see that when he falters when he actually HAS the opportunity. He can't shoot them.  He can barely point the gun at them.  He doesn't violently hurt Ray in the end.  He shoots him in self defense.  And if we call that revenge, then what revenge he does end up getting, lands him blind, and ultimately dead, anyway.   Do we get the idea that Edward is enacting vengeance, from his novel really, or from Susan's life? Do we feel like Edward is even really telling us a such a clear cut revenge tale?  Or do we end up allowing our reading of his story to be colored by Susan's heavy handed expectation for revenge, with the giant revenge painting, with her jumpiness, her anxiety....](#spoiler)",0
1405,"[And finally, in the end-- we don't actually see Susan respond to Edward's message that he is happy to meet up with her to talk.  We never see them actually arrange to meet.  We see her email to him asking to meet.  We see him saying yea just tell me when and where.  And the next thing wee see, is her getting ready to go, with emphasis on her shallowness, on the things that Edward exemplifies that opposite of.   And then we see her enter some incredibly fancy, expensive, elitist restaurant.  Not the kind of place you think that a woman who has realized the emptiness and hollowness of her shallow life choices, and wants now to jump back into more genuine, true things with Edward.](#spoiler)  ",0
1406,"[My reading is that she didn't actually respond to Edward.  That she Chose her shallow and empty lifestyle, once again. We see her fear and guilt taking over her judgement-- she is once again, not brave enough to immerse herself in what Edward symbolizes to her.  It wasn't just her relationship with him that she couldn't bring herself to choose, but she also couldn't really indulge it in herself. She couldn't jump into things creatively, always more concerned with material concerns.   And it leaves her lonely.  But she chose it in the beginning, and she chooses it again at the restaurant, even though it leaves her feeling the pangs of nostalgia (as she occasionally glances at the door--as she notes the conversation behind her of someone being shown to their seat imagining if it were Edward). She is so paralyzed, once again, by her fear of what Edward represents, and watching that play out in her anticipation to receive some kind of revenge, that she doesn't take the risk.  We as the viewers, have been watching this through the perception of Susan-- so we too, are anticipating revenge from Edward.  But in her anticipation of that, she ultimately sabotages herself.] (#spoiler) ",0

She seems somewhat uncomfortable, but ultimately more at ease, or more decided, than she has been at many other points in the film.](#spoiler) The whole novel storyline chilled me to the bone. I haven't been this rattled watching a film in a while. Michael Shannon, Jake Gyllenhaal and, most notably, Aaron Taylor Johnson made the movie. ",0
1409," Are you an owl, lou? Fuck that jumpscare pretty sure this film is every writers revenge fantasy.",0
1410,"I also really liked how they showed how she was losing money in subtle ways, the famous balloon animals statue is there and then disappears in a later shot (forgot the artists name), and the boxed up art at the start in hindsight could be stuff they're selling. The added dread her husband is not trying to save them but instead having affairs and likely spending more money.  I go see every Jake Gyllenhaal movie. My favorite actor running but got dang did I love every second of Michael Shannon on camera. He stole the scenes for me.  I thought this film was amazing. It played with the difference between reality and the book really subtly and I think that's the most interesting part. I also thought it was amazing how it managed to develop the character of Edward Sheffield despite him only appearing in three or so scenes. The only thing I disliked was some of the casting- Laura Linney was great but definitely too young for her character. ",0
1411,"Overall it was an incredibly interesting film that offered a lot to think about.  The novel is an aligory for the break up. If you've ever been left suddenly, the novel represents what it feels like. Aaron taylors character and his friends are all Susan Marrow. Edward was in a relationship and believed everything was going smoothly (the beginning cruse through west Texas). Suddenly Susan tells him that she is unhappy and leaves him. If you have ever been left, it feels brutal. The loss and pain are represented by ray Marcus's bruatality. It's almost unbelievable. Edward would be thinking, ""how can you do this to us"". The wife's death in the novel represents the death of the woman who loved him. When someone leaves you they are no longer the person who loved you. Something else takes over. They become someone else. She became Ray Marcus. One minute they loved you, and now they are acting like someone else. Edward fights to find out where his old love went. it is very painful to realize that the person who used to love you is no Loner there( when he find out she was killed by Ray). Ray is the new personality of his wife and it is not just a faze (ray gets out of jail and continues to exist).  He must confront the new person. Ray's death is Edward confronting and accepting that the woman who used to love him is gone. Edwards death is the death of the part of him that loved his wife. He got over it.  Anyone else find Armie Hammer's casting odd? Especially considering his character has a daughter in her 20s. Hammer was born in '86. Jon Hamm would have been a better (if a little obvious) choice.  Did anyone laugh at the part where [Susan is getting an abortion and her lover tells her ""edward will never find out"" and it turns out he is standing RIGHT THERE watching them the whole time haha](#spoiler) Who??? What are you a fucking owl"" Gone Girl for dudes. This three minute clip of Director Tom Ford basically explains the meaning of the film: http://www.nytimes.com/video/t-magazine/100000004799437/tom-ford-on-nocturnal-animals.html The first 40 minutes were absolutely amazing and whilst the rest of the film wasn't as totally enthralling, it was still very good. Jake Gyllenhaal is so fucking good. ",0

1413," I just came here to say that I thought the whole time that Amy Adams was playing 2 roles. I didn't realize it was Isla Fisher playing the wife from the novel part. [removed] This had the most WTF opening movie scene I've seen in a long time. I would like to hear people's opinions on this: What do you think was Edward's motivation to send the book to Susan? Why do you think he didn't show up to dinner? I think the motif of the film is inarguably revenge. The novel was a way for Edward to get revenge on Susan in quite a few ways: He proved he *can* write about himself, made her fall in love with him again, and then stood her up. (""Once you give up [on love] you might never get it back."") Edward got his revenge, he broke apart her relationship with Walker the same way Walker broke apart their's. Mission accomplished.",0
1414,"So now what is Edward doing at the end when he's not at the restaurant? Killing himself? Killing Walker? When Edward emails her back, he doesn't care when or where but it has to be Tuesday. I think there's a reason for that, he's planning something. **5/5**",0

There’s a sense of disconnect, of lack of relevance, but suddenly parallels between their romance and the typescript’s narrative become apparent, building to a devastating final scene that’s as electrifying as it is inevitable. The film is endlessly evolving, bludgeoning past brutal plot points and descending into irresistible, dirty delirium, heightened by Abel Korzeniowski’s sublimely tempestuous score. Yet director Tom Ford and cinematographer Seamus McGarvey give control to the chaos, with an assuredness applied to the kinetic camerawork, the brooding pans of musty citylife and desolate deserts. The danger and immorality on display really is tangible.",0
1419,"One source of danger comes in the form of Aaron Taylor Johnson’s terrifying and unhinged Ray Marcus, who torments Gyllenhaal and his fictional family. This is Johnson’ best performance of his career, committing to his character’s sleaziness and repugnancy, and preventing Ray from becoming caricaturish. Another brilliantly absurd character is the cop looking for him, played by Michael Shannon with straight-faced hilarity. He’s a character inflicted with lung cancer, who continues to smoke (“Well, yep, that’s how it works”), and nearly steals the show with his deadpan delivery and questionable morals. Other recognisable, or renowned actors, are relegated to the sidelines, however: Michael Sheen and Jena Malone each feature in blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameos, but at least their fleeting moments are highlights.",0
1420,"I’ve seen this film twice now, which I suppose is testament to how the film grips – and then sinks its claws into you. It’s menacing, and bold, and each scene is displayed with enough unwavering confidence and dedication by Ford (save for one Gyllenhaal outburst) that it all holds together. That this is only his sophomoric effort, after his acclaimed ‘A Single Man’, is truly astonishing. He may not just be a fashion designer, but he uses his considerable expertise in that field to capture beautiful imagery and symbolic costume design, and boy, it works.",0
1421,"Ford has birthed a film that’s dripping with grime but presented with gloss, creating an almost ugly beauty that’s visually fascinating. It’s a savage study of an intricate relationship, furnished with the bravado of a director that knows how to handle a script that’s jet-black in both themes and humour, and bolstered by a blistering score and vivid camerawork.",0
1422,Edit: A link to my site in case u want to see this review and other reviews by me! :) http://www.edgarreviews.co.uk/,0
1423,The first twenty minutes of Anthony Hopkins performance should be enough to convince you of his Oscar. It seriously is on par with Silence Of The Lambs.,1
1424,"The movie is so unique as well, I have never seen a movie deal with declining mental health while intertwining intrigue in a respectful manner.",1
1425,"Shout out to Olivia Colman as well who was the glue to hold the whole thing together. There's a beat at the end where the nurse offers to take him out for a walk and I realised I couldn't say for sure that she's even the nurse. Maybe it's Anne, I honestly don't know. It's a really impressive indication of immersion when you've got the audience thinking like that.",1
1426,"Also, this is a more impressive and thematically appropriate distortion of time than Tenet, change my mind. No disrespect to Chadwick Boseman, but I really hope there's either a tie or Hopkins pulls an incredible upset. It's his greatest performance since Silence of the Lambs, absolutely broke my heart, and I won't forget it. Olivia Colman is yet again brilliant as well, and I wouldn't be surprised if she also sneaks in a few awards. ",1
1427,But this is one fucking terrifying experience. Especially if you've seen a loved one go through this same experience. It also perfectly captures how horrible and frustrating it is to have to see it happen. ,1
1428,"Usually, in these types of films, we are looking from the outside in, but instead, this is more of a dementia simulator. The thought of losing my mind like that is horrifying and this film presents it in such a powerful and effective way that I haven't quite seen before. I loved it. Me, sobbing uncontrollably: ""Is that all you got, Hopkins"" This movie was absolutely fantastic. I wish more people would talk about it. Anthony Hopkins delivers one of his best performances of all time. That last scene from him alone is worth an Oscar. the central metaphor is placed on a watch, there is a loose grip of reality held by anthony as time is shattered fragmentation. he grows dependent on an object that is supposedly a reliable, tangible constant, but is unable to keep track of it due to dementia and time slips through his fingers quite figuratively and literally.",1
1429,"clever cinematography; the moving chamber effect inspired double takes at every juncture and led me, an able-minded and youthful viewer to grow increasingly dazed, confused, distressed. unexpectedly, i felt like i was watching a horror film, psychologically manipulated and scammed by false realities, leaving me feeling daft and dim. the father captured an inaccessible lens of the older generation, installing an unforgettable perspective that we often dismiss guiltlessly, without so much as a second thought. ",1
1430,"this film is a necessary watch for all. everyone has a parent, a grandparent, an elder in their life. corporeality can become so fragile and we will never truly comprehend the point of collapse until we witness it firsthand — and even then, we still only see a glimpse of the trauma, incertitude and fear real people face. however, while most of us can never completely empathize, but we could stand to gain from being more understanding. Can we talk about the production design for a moment? The Father has one of the most frightening use of set pieces, colour, and architecture I've ever seen in a film. It’s not inherently scary (compared to say how a horror movie would use darkness, spider webs, and such), but the way the flat changes throughout the film instills just enough doubt to make you question if it's actually the way you remember it or not. The emphasis on hallways and uncertain positioning left me with only small pieces of a mental map of the space, making it difficult to even know where rooms are relative to each other. It's almost a character, actively subverting your own memory. Truly incredible. So many great moments where the director just blindsides you. My favourite was the dinner scene, it caught me off guard and watching it all play again was something else.",1
1431,"That ending as well was something I wasn't expecting at all. Any other year this would be 100% Hopkins Oscar to lose right? Incredible film. Hopkins DESERVES that oscar This was arguably the best performance of Hopkins’ illustrious career and that’s saying something when his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter exists. It’s such a raw and authentic performance. Hopkins captures the downward spiral of his character perfectly. The last scene is equal parts horrifying and moving. He looks so vulnerable in that scene, you feel like giving him a hug. The bit about losing his leaves would have sounded absurd coming from any other actor but man, does Hopkins sell it. Masterclass acting.",1
1432,"Also Olivia Colman’s performance will probably not get as much attention, but she is incredible too. She does a really good job of portraying someone who has to come to terms with the illness of a loved one. This movie fucking devastated me.",1
1433,I cried hot angry tears at the end. ,1
1434,This movie is also a psychological horror film unlike anything ever made before.,1
1435,"Absolutely unreal. It rivals The Sound Of Metal for me, for best of the last year. A masterclass in acting from Hopkins. Excellent all around. ",1
1436,"One scene that I found very amusing was the scene where he kept asking about the husband's watch, and if perhaps he kept the receipt. I could also see this from the husband's side, it must be incredibly frustrating to deal with a person with this condition every day. I can't think of any other film where the narrative structure is so deeply intertwined with the editing of shots, it was absolutely insane to wrap my head around. I can't even imagine what it takes to write a story like this, much less translate it into film, but it was done so masterfully. Definitely one of my favorites of the year.! The ending in which Anthony breaks down and saying he wants his mother and that he only knows that he has the watch on his wrist was just so heartbreaking. Really couldn’t stop thinking about it for the past week. Fantastic movie. ",1
1437,"I haven't seen discussion yet on the chronology. I know this is really quite pointless since I know the point is that we really aren't supposed to quite know what's going on, but I'm curious how people are interpreting the events. I interpret the timeline as follows:",1
1438,"- Anthony lives alone in his own flat, has a quarrel with a caretaker named Angela (latest in a long line), which forces Anne and James/Paul to take him in (nixing the plans for the Italian vacation)",1
1439,"- Anthony lives (perhaps for years) with Anne and Paul (actually probably named James), but James/Paul's behavior escalates to abuse and eventually the couple divorce and she puts him in a nursing home. During this time, he also meets the caretaker Laura,  who looks like Lucy.",1
1440,"- Anthony lives for years (at least 5 because she's 5 years out from a divorce) in the nursing home, with Anne visiting regularly, but then she tells him she's moving to Paris ",1
1441,"-At the end, Anne has been living in Paris for months with a man named Paul",1
1442,"My thought is most of the movie is just jumbled memory, Anthony reliving painful events and supplanting faces, names and places, when he's actually been at the nursing home the whole time. ",1
1443,"The only thing I can't really wrap my mind around is how he's mixing up events that haven't happened yet, like telling the doctor that Anne is moving to Paris. I think maybe in the moment he said something confusing to Anne and then in his memory he's replacing it with the Paris bit. Thoughts? It’s there with Minari and Soul as one of my favorites of 2020. It scared the absolute bejeezus out of me. Everyone is rightfully raving about how insane Hopkins is — short of maybe Elephant Man, this might be my favorite performance of his — but can we talk about the production design and how every setting is the same set dressed differently to keep us in Anthony’s headspace, completely unsure of when and where we are? I felt my stomach drop so many times trying to make sense of it and realizing that part of the game the movie is playing is that there is no making sense of it. It’s an MC Escher painting; there’s no beginning and no end and no way to orient yourself, and that’s what Anthony is going through. Anthony Hopkins was far too good in this film to lose the Oscar to Chadwick Boseman. His performance absolutely blows the competition out of the water. This is a horror film disguised as an Oscar film. Jesus christ. I didn't think you could find a kindred spirit of ""I'm Thinking Of Ending Things"" this year.",1
1444,"It's acted wonderfully, the editing and direction is impeccable, the way that conversations and hints seem to repeat themselves is haunting, but...good lord, you are gonna feel like shit when it's done. Now having watched this, I find Anthony Hopkins losing the Oscar, or any other award this year for that matter, to be a sick joke. It actually makes me mad. I watched this last night and at the end my wife is sobbing uncontrollably. After she composes herself as we are lying in bed and asks, “why would anyone ever watch a movie like that?!” And though there are many ways to respond to that I decided to mention all the people that no one knows about who are dealing with those suffering from dementia. Specifically the nurse at the end of the movie. There are any number of people just like her all over the world walking in to rooms with an Anthony inside - losing his grip on reality, responding sometimes violently and sometimes inconsolably. People who have been asked to take over for guilt ridden family members who finally get to a point where all their sadness is overwhelmed by their exhaustion and helplessness. It’s these people that sit next to an 80 year old crying for their mother, holding them until they forget why their crying and decide to go for a walk. I never thought about them, never had a need to think on them, and I’m grateful they are there. Anthony Hopkins was phenomenal. He's my personal choice to win Best Actor this year (and I really hope he pulls an upset). I saw this a couple weeks ago so glad to finally see a discussion for it.",1
1445,"Of all of the Oscar nominees I've seen so far (which is all of them except Mank at this point), I think *The Father* has stuck with me the most, even if it wasn't my out-and-out favourite. The film is just incredible; it is not often I'm moved to full-on tears by a piece of media but dammit, it happened twice here.",1
1446,"Much is being made of Hopkins' performance, and for good reason - it is a towering achievement. I absolutely loved Ahmed in Sound of Metal and would be chuffed to pieces if he won, but Best Lead is 100% going to either Hopkins or Boseman. I'd be happy with either, personally.",1
1447,"However, the structure of the film is probably the aspect which impressed me the most - it truly is like almost nothing I've ever seen before. As someone elsewhere in the thread said, *The Father* stands out because of the way in which it deals with mental illness - we're not on the outside looking in, as is usually the case, but rather right there inside Anthony's head and experiencing everything as he perceives it. It is genuinely terrifying and the use of multiple actors to portray the same characters, heightening the disorientation, is an inspired touch. I have heard this film being called a horror movie and honestly, I can't disagree.",1
1448,"Back to Hopkins though, my god. Understated one moment then brimming with ferocity and outrage the next, this is yet another reminder of why he is one of the all-time greats. There will be some who dismiss his performance as showy Oscar-bait, but that would be doing a massive disservice to his work here. He is the anchor of the piece, the reason the entire film works as well as it does. His vulnerability and pathos are why this is ultimately such an emotionally affecting story, and why the ending is so utterly devastating. In a lesser performer's hands *The Father* could easily have been an overwrought, overly-saccharine drama with no punch at all; as it is, it is one of the best films I will never watch again. I think this might be the best work of Hopkins' career, which is saying a lot.",1
1449,I'd give him the Oscar over Chadwick personally (great performance though that was).,1
1450,"Chadwick will 98% win but given that the film just hit VOD and the voting deadline isn't for a few more weeks I don't think an upset is impossible. I cried like a baby at the end.  My dad is at the beginning stages of something similar and it hurts so much when he tells me something he's told me multiple times before, or when I tell him something and he doesn't remember it anymore when I bring it up.",1
1451,"Give me a Sam Cooke biopic starting Leslie Odom Jr. I really should watch more stage adaptations. I loved this one, most importantly the one-on-one interactions between the four main characters. I love this cast, and Kingsley Ben-Adir especially is an amazing Malcolm X, with a level of vulnerability that I've never seen. ",0
1452,"Shoutout to Mad Dog from Riverdale, he was a great Cassius Clay. Movin on up! Haha Wow never seen a thread posed while I was watching the movie.",0
1453,Everyone did very well in their parts.,0
1454,"That aquantence of Jim Brown talking up his football career, being all chummy then not letting him in the house was depressing but hilarious. Having “A Change Gonna Come” finish the film was a master stroke I hope I’m not the only one who thought Kingsley Ben-Adir was the best out of the bunch.",0
1455,"I know Leslie Odom Jr. is getting all the love by the critics, but I think Kingsley Ben-Adir packs more of a punch as Malcolm X.",0
1456,"Impressive directorial debut by Regina King. That opening scene for Jim Brown is the most jarring and effective use of the n-word I’ve ever seen in storytelling. I don’t know why, but I was SO taken aback by the casualness, the incongruity with the previous exchange, and the polite tone. I would just like to add, amongst all the praise and discussion that this movie deservedly receives, that holy shit Aldis Hodge as Jim Brown is gorgeous. Like goddamn he is ridiculously good-looking. I could've watched ten hours of Sam Cooke & Malcolm X going at it. What's funny is that I agreed with both of them. I really enjoyed the movie. ",0
1457,"I had never heard of the actor who played Malcolm X, but his performance caught me off guard by both the intensity and vulnerability he brought to the character. You could see his strengths and struggles. Sorry, I'm not really great at describing these sorts of things. I thought all four of the actors were good, but Leslie Odom Jr and Kingsley Bed-Adir were just a little bit better. As a Fringe fan it was also great to see Lance Reddick.",0
1458,"I already knew the history between Cooke and Dylan's ""Blowing in the Wind."" (I even predicted that was the song Malcolm was going to play) But the idea of tying in that history/inspiration of ""A Change is Gonna Come"" and giving it to Malcolm X was brilliant.  ",0
1459,"The four of them together was what got me to want to see this movie, but the various times they would split up made for some wonderful scenes and interactions. Great moments between Brown and Clay and then later it would be Brown and Malcom or Cooke and Clay. Cooke and Malcolm's debates/arguments were top notch. ",0
1460,"I was surprised that at the end of the movie they didn't include a note about Sam Cooke's tragic death which would occur less than a year later. It's really sad to think that within two years of that special night the four of them shared, that two of them would be dead. ",0
1461,"Also I knew it was a long shot, but seeing Malcolm take those pictures throughout the movie had me really thinking/hoping we'd see them during the credits. This was great. Like other stage-to-film adaptations, the pacing can sometimes feel slow during all the talking, but it's full of well-acted, thought-provoking conversations between these notable Black men. Some nice framing and set design (loved that shot of a neon-lit Malcolm looking out of a window toward the end). Kingsley Ben-Adir was excellent and deserves the awards talk he's been getting, and I also really liked Eli Goree. Always happy to see Lance Reddick pop up too.",0
1462,[Here's](https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Malcolm-X-Cassius-Clay.jpg) a picture of the real Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali in a Miami diner after Ali's win.,0
1463,"Queen Regina King continues to be good at everything she does! Just want to acknowledge Kemp Powers who wrote the play and screenplay adaptation. Aside from this movie he’s only done one other film. And that is Pixar’s Soul. God Damn No one gonna take about how funny Goree was as Cassius. Him calling his opponent ugly got a good laugh out of me Watching the sensational Boston a cappella scene gave me the kind of live-music chills I didn’t even realize I’d been missing so much Debuting this late after its festival premiere has mostly hobbled this one’s shot at Oscar gold, which is a shame, cause it’s the best movie of the year. In a weaker year, Ben-Adir would be guaranteed for a leading actor nom, but as is, the movie’s probably gonna have to settle for supporting actor for Odom (very deserved) and adapted screenplay",0
1464,"The four leads deliver some of the finest performances of the year, and it’s brought to life by one of the strongest scripts in recent memory. King’s direction is sort of hurt by the staginess inherent to the story, but still very strong. In particular, the early scenes and the moments when they leave the room. When I first saw it during TIFF, I really under-appreciated Hodge’s performance, but I found him to be very crucial to the discussions happening (and also, *really* funny). Goree seems to have channeled Muhammad Ali’s spirit into himself, because he’s like the man himself in almost every regard",0
1465,"Fun fact: Cooke performed “A Change is Gonna Come” in front of an audience only once before his death, but the tape was lost because the studio just sort of destroyed it, not seeing its value. The ending of this film is the closest the world will get to seeing that Watching this reminds me of some conversations me and friends used to have sitting in the dorms at Hampton University. For many of us, including me, this was the first time I’d not been the only black kid in the group. A bunch of black men from different parts of the country with different experiences and different backgrounds trying to figure out for ourselves what’s the way forward for black folks. I met my first black republican in one such discussion. Discussed the Nation of Islam and Farrakhan, etc. Good stuff. Leslie Odom Jr. as Sam Cooke was the highlight — felt like you were watching the real guy at times. ",0
1466,"Also the ending was fantastic, the shot of the Malcolm X autobiography interspersed with “A Change is Gonna Come” kinda took my breath away tbh see's Jim Brown on The Dirty Dozen set",0
1467,"Leo point* You can hear the conflict in this movie in Sam Cooke's two incredible live albums, one at the Copacabana and one at the Harlem Square Club in Miami. I may be in the minority but I thought Aldis hodge was the best part of the movie the other guys were just as fantastic but I thought Aldis hodge brought something different can’t wait to see him as hawkman in black Adam! Kingsley Ben-Adir is having himself a year! I'm no well spoken film critic so I won't even try with all that.",0
1468,I liked this movie a lot.  It's only January but I can already tell this will be one of my top 10 of the year.  I have no complaints.  It was perfect for me.,0
1469,"If you're recommending this to anyone, tell them not to watch the trailer or read anything about it beforehand.  I watched this movie knowing nothing except the plot description from PrimeVideo and I think it's one of those films that's just better when you know nothing about it going in.",0
1470,"10/10 I don’t like doing the comparison game but sometimes it’s tough not to. Watching this movie and looking back at Ma Rainey’s you can really see the difference in taking a stage performance and translating it to the big screen. The slight change of scenery gives you a breath of fresh air needed at times. Both movies are very tense at times but where ma Rainey’s stays put, One Night in Miami takes us to the roof or liquor store. I enjoyed Ma Rainey’s so please don’t think this is a knock but I think One Night in Miami shows how to take it to the next level. I could talk for hours about this movie but I’ll reserve. Great movie and highly recommend. Knowing the backstory definitely helps a lot.",0
1471,"Mohammad Ali never forgave himself for turning his back on Malcolm. That scene between Aldis Hodge and Beau Bridges blew me away...did not see that coming...should have...but didn't. In some ways, the film almost bears a strange resemblance to something like *The Breakfast Club*. John Hughes presented a brain, a beauty, a jock, a rebel and a recluse; Regina King presents a boxer, a baller, an artist and an activist. What bound *The Breakfast Club’s* teens together were the various pains and struggles of adolescence, and what binds these men together are the various pains and struggles racial prejudice. The latter obviously far outweighs the former in terms of importance, but I thought it was an interesting comparison.",0
1472,The kid actors were so insanely good.,0
1473,That ending hit me like a bag of bricks.,0
1474,Mac’s mom is being type cast  I found the ending as a parallel to what Mildred was saying to the Priest earlier in the movie.,1
1475,"That even though he didn't rape her daughter, and he wasn't even in the same country, he is still culpable because he is in the same group of people who would do that sort of thing.",1
1476,Just something I thought was interesting. Woody Harrelson's character was fantastic.  I like that it wasn't a black v. white conflict between his character and McDormand's character.  The letter he left her was hilarious.  I liked how McDormand's character was illogical and flawed. ,1
1477," Dinklage deserved more screen time.  Sam Rockwell was great as ever. ""She said *'begets'*?"" ",1
1478,"My theater was dying, so good.  This is my favorite movie from this year.  The part where Mildred screams Robbie's name when he's trying to stop her from putting out the fires is heartbreaking. 1. The blood splattering on Mildred's face was such an effective bit of tonal whiplash. I love how it takes both the audience and her aback for just a couple seconds and literally wipes the smile off her face; it's a shocking moment, a brilliantly performed moment by both actors. ",1
1479,"2. Well that makes it two amazing  performances as redneck racist cops this year, but who'd have thunk one could grow to sympathize with such a character. Rockwell and McDormand give career-bests here.",1
1480,"3. Haven't heard much talk about Carter Burwell's score around but I'd actually say this is his best collaboration with McDonagh yet, particularly love the track that plays over Harrelson's final moments.",1
1481,"4. Nice to see Željko Ivanek not as the butt monkey this time, but instead one of the more competent of the police officers.",1
1482,"EDIT Typo I think my favorite character was Red. He didn't ask for any of this trouble and was just trying to do his job. But even after all that, he still makes sure that the straw is facing the right way in the orange juice he poured for his attacker. Can we talk about that fire scene? I thought it was perfect. The emotional weight of Dixon reading Willoughby's final words to him, contrasted with the molotov cocktails all while the music is playing made me laugh my fucking ass off. Best scene in the movie IMO.",1
1483,"Also that tracking shot was awesome, also got a lot of laughs.",1
1484,"Anyone think that Dixon might have been gay? His tendencies to get really close to people, his aggressiveness and almost obsession with the billboard guy, and his remark to his mom about not having a nice lady.  Funniest moment for me... ""Isn't that racist?""",1
1485,&nbsp;,1
1486,"Also, while Kenneth Branagh wins for Best Lead Mustache for MotOE... Peter Dinklage should most assuredly win for Best Supporting Mustache for this film.  A lot of really great writing in this movie:",1
1487,-  The three billboards / the three letters,1
1488,- The fact that Willoughby is a weirdly good writer then Dixon explains that you need to be good at English to be a cop,1
1489,"-  The wine bottle as a weapon fake-out, a great reference to In Bruges",1
1490,This movie had a ton of cool layers on top of being gripping and very funny.  I enjoyed it.  The sheriff paying the last month for the billboards to fuck with Mildred was the best.,1
1491,"Also, I loved Peter Dinklage in this, and that date was heartbreaking. How are not just talking about that wonderful bunny slipper crucifixion scene? The scene where Dixon attacks the billboard company might be my new favorite scene of the year. Such a great depiction of grief on film, and a microcosm of the whole film. Unhealthy grieving at its most unhealthy. The beautiful song, the unbroken shot, Sam Rockwell trying his hardest not be charming, Caleb Landry Jones taking the on-screen beating of a lifetime, and even some of the little comedic beats. It's all so wonderful. It's amazing how McDonaugh manages to get you to sympathize with both the attacker and the victim in this scene, I loved it.  I really wish this had ended with the *What a coincidence I'm headed to Idaho in the morning* phone call. The most emotional scene of the movie and probably the year for me was Woody Harrelson's last scene... Fucking Wow.  Samara Weaving as Mildred's Ex-Husbands Girlfriend absolutely slayed me and the entire theatre. Can we please talk about the CGI deer. I saw it last week and enjoyed it tremendously. I think it is the best thing McDonagh has done at this point in his career. Even as a viewer well-acquainted with (and appreciative of) his majestically dark sense of humor, I found myself rocked by how bleak ""Three Billboards"" could be, at certain times.",1
1492,"It is worth mentioning that, for me, one of the most tragic moments in the film was the revelation that the billboards were in view of Mildred's house. Since we know that Angela was raped and murdered at the billboards (as evidenced by the scorch marks on the ground), this means that—even as she was enduring all of that fear, pain and suffering—she could see her home. As a viewer, you have to wonder if she was, in her final moments, praying that her mother or brother might see her and be able to provide help... or even just be there to hold her hand as she lay dying.",1
1493,"And the fact that this aspect of the crime is never directly remarked upon by any character (as far as I can recall... I did have to take a bathroom break) speaks to McDonagh's respect for the viewer. What was going on with Abbie Cornish's floating accent? My favorite scene was easily the ""one shot throwing red out a window"" sequence. It really defined Rockwell's character. Just saw it and love the way it makes you think about everything when it’s over. Bottom line though, at least to me, is that we (the audience) are meant to feel exactly as Mildred felt; Empty and longing for answers. We don’t get a nice gift-wrapped conclusion where everything is resolved and makes us feel better. But then, neither does she. I don’t understand the rationale of including the gift shop scene. When the guy brags in the bar, he knows about Angela’s death. He’s still in Ebbing! Why is he bragging about raping and killing a different girl? Why the need for the gift shop to set up the twist? It’s a twist even without that scene and now we just have this odd unnecessary context that raises more questions than it answers. ",1
1494,"Are we to believe that he’s a random sadistic murderer passing through Ebbing, pretending he’s Angela’s killer to get a rise from Mildred, and getting off to bragging about raping/killing a different girl in a bar later? There’s just so many hoops to jump through to get an explanation for the gift shop scene.  I just didn't understand what the point of this movie was or what it was trying to say. It felt completely aimless and tonally non-nonsensical. I really enjoyed Sam Rockwell's performance, but that's about it. I didn't understand any motivations of the characters and the whole movie just felt like actors acting. I didn't hate it, but I definitely missed the point of the movie if there was one. Please feel free to help explain to me what you got out of it.  Wondering why I'm not seeing more about one of the most important themes in the film - the fact that the suspect/soldier/rapist is ironic and symbolic. ",1
1495,"Essentially, he is a rapist and murderer. He raped and murdered a girl in Iraq or Afghanistan. He lives amongst us with impunity and gets away with it bc of the blind eye we turn to such things for people who mean little to us here, and who are marginalized. That man, the way he rubbed her daughter's death in her face, was indicative of the kind of scum that he was, and the brazen way such people walk amongst us. ",1
1496,"The fact that the characters in this film were able to evolve and change, not always through direct salvation or attainment of their actual goal (we never find Angie's killer, the dwarf never gets to fall in love, Dixon doesn't become a detective), but find it in other ways (The chief leaves earth on his own terms, Angie's mom for once wishes her ex well rather than giving him the angry reaction he wants, Dixon finds a true suspect through different means), and this keeps up with said theme. We never find Angie's killer. But there is a chance at identifying and possibly bringing to ""justice"" another rapist/murderer of young girls. ",1
1497,"To me, this all sums up the fact that despite life's chaotic, and often unfulfilling circumstances, we can find salvation and the universal attainment of progress in indirect, human ways amidst the random unrest. ",1
1498,"Anyway, so much more to discuss and so many great themes everyone is touching on...but just wanted to bring forth that particular aspect of the film, where I feel something important was being alluded to, much like police brutality issues, racism, and other things in the film. . McDormand better get an Oscar nomination at least.",1
1499,Edit: Oh shit. She won.,1
1500,"This summers been all about disappointing blockbusters, remakes, and reboots. Nice to see a movie that is well written, has actual character development, and is patient and nuanced. Probably the best thing that Chris Pine has ever done, and I quite like him in the first Star Trek,",1
1501, It's my favorite of the year so far. I'm probably going to go again soon. Couldn't recommend it more My two favourite scenes/moments:,1
1502,"- Chris Pine visibly nervous, trying to keep his composure as the cop checks his license at the road block.",1
1503,"- When Chris essentially challenges Jeff Bridges to a duel on the porch, Jeff subtly inches his fingers toward his gun before the truck with the ex-wife and kids pulls into the driveway.",1
1504,"Just excellent, small details in their acting that drew me into the story better than any movie I've seen in theater this year. Did anyone else get the idea that the blonde brother was a veteran? It started with the first scene with the graffiti about veterans troubles, made me think that the director wanted us to think about that. When I saw how he taped his clips together I thought ""that seems like an army trick"". And when he took out his sniper rifle and started making great shots, it kind of clicked for me.  Most of what I liked about this film has already been posted. One thing I haven't seen mentioned: NO LOVE INTEREST. I was dreading it first when the waitress was all flirty, then when the girl approached him in the casino, then with his ex wife, but nope. It made the relationship with his brother all the more powerful, and it was enough that he was going through all this to break the cycle of poverty with his kids. My favorite part of this movie is how utterly absorbed -everyone- in the theater was.  When Alberto was sniped near the end, almost everyone there let out a collective gasp.",1
1505,"That, and Jeff Bridges as a cowboy. I think this film was a perfect example of translating the Western into the modern world. People are trying to hold on to the way things used to be, but you can't outrun the trains of ""progress.""",1
1506,"I guess Chris Pine's character ""won"" in the end, but at a terrible cost...and regardless of what he did, he can't stop the change. His kids aren't going to work the ranch, and the banks will keep taking advantage of the locals. ",1
1507,"I'm not really sure there's a ""Bolivia"" left in the world to hide, even for a time. ",1
1508,"Great, great film. Great story, great writing, great performances. Head and shoulders above anything else I've seen this year.  Does a movie like this with such strong brother relationships resonate strongly with any one else?  We don't see any flashback, just an old photo of the two of them, but the dialogue is so descriptive that we can make out what their lives had been before.  ",1
1509,"The second casino bar scene really got to me as a person with a sibling, as in the first we see Tobye just patiently waiting to cash out, anxious for the next job, before he interacts with another women.  However he is ""saved"" by his brother and you see how the two of them are different but there for one another.  And then when Toby hears the news of the shootout on the Tv and it just fades out and we see him curl up around the chips and put his brother's hat on and just cries.  Man that was such an emotional scene fore me and I think every actor and actress in the movie really gave amazing performances.  I think that the actors show the characters pain and different issues so realistically, and the writing is still so dramatic and captivating.",1
1510,"Ben Foster as Tanner was so calculated.  His brother reminds him to ""slow down"" but the reply is ""I'm not speeding"" just foreshadows how ruthless and and prepared the older brother is.  He killed their abusive father,putting an end to the dangerous situation.   He doesn't hesitate to kill two armed civilians to protect Toby.  He is constantly lugging around ""his livelihood"" much to Toby's protest but when it looks as if they are going to be run down by the militia, Tanner effectively and efficiently disarms the situation he saw coming.  I don't remember exactly what his last lines went, [I am the master of the plains, this is who I am].  Which mirrored the Native American encounter earlier in the bar, is then brought full circle.  When Jeff Bridges character, winded and tired, claims the kill to avenge his fallen partner.  ",1
1511,"Man I loved this movie, I felt so lucky to watch it the in morning, very empty theater, the only downside was that the screen was flickering the whole time, distracting from the brightness and what was happening on screen.  I'm curious as to what other people thought about the cinematography and if I should see it again in a better theater.",1
1512,"  The showdown between Pine and Bridges at the end is my favorite ending to any movie i've seen this year. Edge of my seat throughout the whole thing.  I can't give this film enough praise, my favorite scene was the exchange between Tanner and the Comanche in the casino.",1

1518,"Taylor Sheridan is really knocking it out of the park, I hope his next film continues the trend Absolutely **love** how this movie used violence through its later half. As you're watching the initial robberies, due to the lack of (extreme) physical harm, you start to think, ""ohhh they're harmless, nothing *too* bad is really going to happen..."", but during the final robbery when they shoot and kill? Completely shocked! Caught me with a bat right across the head and reminded me that these are dangerous situations and that no, you can't just rob a bank with zero consequence. True Fact Mr. Pibb is for Assholes I went in to this movie expecting to laugh exactly 0 times. I left the movie having laughed more than I did watching Suicide Squad.  I love how the movie puts so much effort into developing the characters that you eventually do care about their fates. Like when Jeff Bridges' partner was shot in the head, I was shocked and a little upset. What don't you want?   Hands down, best movie of the summer. The scene with the waitress had me cracking up for awhile This is definitely in my top 5 of the year so far.",1
1519,"Fantastic acting from Pine, Foster, and Bridges , superb writing and direction and  great music.",1
1520,"It was funny when it needed to be, tension filled the screen when it should have and the ending was pitch perfect in keeping with the tone of the time. I recommend everyone who has a chance to go see this does. This film was absolutely fantastic. Most of the positive comments cover what I loved about it. ",1
1521,"But I'll add that this movie shows that the western is not dead but is still very alive. The genre offers so much and I hope to see more in the near future.  In a movie filled with memorable moments, the most amazing to me was Jeff Bridges' ten-second bit of acting after his character shoots Tanner (Ben Foster). Going from temporary joy at getting revenge on the man who killed his partner, to horrified sadness at the thought that he did, indeed, just kill someone. A perfect summary of the complicated morals of the film, all conveyed through Bridges' performance.",1
1522,Brilliant film. Great movie.  Great performances by everyone.  I love a Nick Cave and Warren Ellis composed score.  Always pleasing.,1
1523,"And again, I don't know how the hell Hollywood has done Ben Foster so wrong.  The dude deserves more roles.  He acts circles around his peers.",1
1524,"Only complaint: They didn't need to beat you over the head with the bank message.  I would have got the message well enough with the plot, and maybe one or two trips down a highway littered with 'For Sale' and 'Debt Management' signs.  And, again, you know, the plot.  They were a little heavy-handed with driving that point home.",1
1525,"But still, enjoyed the movie very much.  Girlfriend is listening to the soundtrack as she cooks supper this very moment. That last bank sequence was amazing. So fucking tense. I loved the way Ben Foster ordered the bank tellers to take out the money in unison like a drill sergeant. And then when they're trying to escape, more civilians are shooting at them outside. ",1
1526,"Moral of the story: Don't rob banks in Texas While neither the themes (the financial crisis) or the films that really clearly inspired *Hell or High Water* (*No Country For Old Men, Dog Day Afternoon*) are subtle, they don't have to be.",1
1527,"When you lead with graffiti that bemoans the economic downturn from the perspective of someone who did three tours in Iraq, an older woman in a threadbare dress smoking her last cigarette before opening a small town bank, and a 1988-1992 era Camaro ZR2 in present day--you know this is a poor area. And you feel it. The desolation permeates every single frame.",1
1528,"Nearly every scene is filled with the poor, people living from paycheck to paycheck, people who have settled into their lives and don't want to change. Even the bank management, who are by and large the villains of this film, are clearly in a situation where they know they can't get ahead and will take any measure to defend what scraps they can get.",1
1529,"So when you get levity in Jeff Bridges' near-retirement Texas Ranger and his partner played by Journeyman B-Movie Needs A Native American actor Gil Birmingham, or the few spots of brotherly infighting and fun between the bank robbing duo of Chris Pine and Ben Foster... It's well appreciated.",1

1542,"Very thought-provoking movie. The conclusion left me feeling so sorry for Eddy's father. At first, it seemed like the story was suggesting that the unethical aspect of what happened was that the families weren't told about the true nature of the study and were unfairly deprived of each other. And while those parts were horrible, I think the worst part was that three men and their families had to endure the indignity of being treated like a subject in a parenting experiment. Like many parents, Eddy's father had to cope with the suicide of his child. But unlike other parents, he also had to face the scrutiny of being compared to the fathers of the other two 'identical' men, as if the suicide had to be directly attributed to his parenting style. I thought that was horribly unfair. No one becomes a parent expecting to be have their parenting style judged as if in a controlled experiment... even the 'best' of parents can't stand up 100% to that type of scrutiny or avoid all tragedy. Just got back from seeing it too so I need a little time to unpack everything but it was a very well done documentary. There was a bunch of holy shit moments ",0
1543,"EDIT: in regards to the research assistant. She seemed really funny and interested YET she seemed to have little to no empathy for the studies being done to these children and it kind of puts her in a bad light.  I agree that there wasn't enough on the older adopted sisters. Can you imagine finding or orchestrating families with different incomes, all having an older adopted sister of the same age, and all from the same agency?",0
1544,What about the murder? How can they just glaze over that and not really explain it?,0
1545,"I was curious about their ""troubled childhoods"" and psychiatric help. And about Eddie's behavior before he met the brothers. What was he like? Would that help explain the suicide? At the end one of the brothers seemed to subtly blame Eddie's dad's strict parenting style. That seemed unfair to me but I don't know any other information.",0
1546,Also I'm wondering if the study was picking birth parents with mental health issues or if the two twin sets is just a coincidence. Of course that's something that we could learn from finding the other twins. But it makes more sense to me that the purpose of the study was to look at children of parents with mental health issues than studying parental practices. The parental practices idea only came from that one guy who left the study so maybe he didn't know a lot.,0
1547,I was curious if any lawsuit was pursued. Was any law broken by the agency not letting the parents know all the conditions of the study? ,0
1548,"Has anyone been able to find any other information outside of the documentary? I could only find a couple wiki pages but they didn't say much.  The champagne popping part was the oh shit for me. Of course at the time it just seems odd, what did these people just get away with? Now knowing everything we know now.... it gets really dark for me. I used to be a conspiracy theorist and hate that this movie rustled long dormant parts of my brain awake. HOW DEEP DOES THIS GO???? WHERE ARE THE DOCUMENTS??? Kidding kinda. All in all a heartbreaking movie that i was hooked to the entire time. 9/10 1.  I don't know what to make of it.  He was unethical in the extreme, whether it had to do with what he experienced or not.",0
1549,2. I think that's part of the power of the film.  How could this have happened?  Why is it still being suppressed?  Who's behind all this?,0
1550,"3. No, I thought she was a fucking sociopath, with her attempts to justify what was done to these boys and who knows how many others.  At least the other research assistant allowed that he ""might"" have been ethically compromised.",0
1551,4. The boys' smiles.  Truly capable of lighting up the darkest of rooms.,0
1552,"5. ""Oh shit,"" and ""You're fucking kidding me,"" and ""No fucking way,"" and ""Oh. My. Fucking.  God.""   Not since ""Brokeback Mountain"" has a film gotten so under my skin.  And this was a documentary!",0
1553,"6. Well, this was all before DNA testing, and DNA testing is dependent on who participates.  So the impact could have been profound, or it could have been negligible, or it could have been moot.  In temporal context, it was moot.  ",0
1554," Thanks for the questions, though.  I saw the movie alone, and I don't know anyone who's seen it, and I'm DYING to discuss it! Ok, I was waiting to hear from any adoptees, as I am. Given to an agency, went to a foster family for 6 weeks, then adopted with my ""forever family"". ",0
1555,"This research was disgusting on so many levels. I was appalled, shocked, dismayed, distraught.... Think of this from the adult adopted child viewpoint. We had no say in the matter, none. ",0
1556,"Children were commoditites. This film got me thinking. Was the OB/GYN doc/ hospital involved in referring pregnant Moms to this agency. Was the mental health practitioner given something for referring his /her pregnant Jewish patient to this ""researcher"" . Why didn't we get to find out what the agency was toasting. You guessed that the parent overheard. ",0
1557,"Finally, they searched for the birthmother and found her. What about birthdad? What about the 4 sets of twins that weren't notified. I hope a class action lawsuit comes out of this.  [deleted] I’m late to the party, just saw it. ",0
1558,I just don’t think scientists thought as much about ethics at the time (think about the Stanford Prison Experiment).  We still want to understand nature vs nurture. ,0
1559,"5. Most of my “oh shit” moments came late in the film: the siblings and parents were part of the research design, the report won’t be unsealed until 2066, there was no consideration or warning of biological mental illness.  I see there was an AMA with the director a couple of days ago:",0

So I don't have all that much faith in the JBFCS when they say they are now going to do the right thing.""",0

What kinds of families do they have?  What prompted Robert to leave the Triplets restaurant? What kind of relationship do Robert and David have with each other now? Just came home from seeing this. Such a great documentary. I loved how the director was able to craft a tight 90 minute film with no narrator. It was all participants and news clips without a ""voice of god"" to come in to advance the story. Brilliant filmmaking telling an incredible story.",0
1568,My responses:,0
1569,"1. The Nazi tests were about direct torture. In contrast, this was about observing orphans being adopted by loving families. Not saying it was ethical, but to a psychiatrist in the early 60s, I can see it being a benign way to finally figure out nature v. nurture. I bet a Nazi comparison wouldn't have even crossed his mind.",0
1570,"2. I think the movie concluded fairly resolutely that nurture is more important than nature. The similarities the brothers had were superficial. One of the relatives stated that our genes might try to sway our direction, but in the end, the way we are raised is more important.",0
1571,"3. I liked both research assistants. At least they had the courage to speak in front of a camera. Acknowledge that it wasn't ethical now, but it was also the 60s, things change and it was all considered good science then. It doesn't show them in their best light, but I salute them talking when obviously no else would.",0
1572,"4. Hard to pick one favorite scene. Maybe the father getting teary eyed talking about his son's suicide. Up to that point he was presented as kind of a villain. In the end, you realize we are all human. We try our best, but we also fuck up and live with regrets.",0
1573,"5. I was thinking ""oh shit"" pretty much every 10 minutes.",0
1574,"6. I'm sure since the film came out, more people have found a lost twin they had no idea existed. As [GEng7](https://www.reddit.com/user/GEng7) said, if I was adopted through the Louise Wise Agency and filmed as a kid, alarm bells should be going off. I have to say I wasn’t a huge fan of this movie. I felt like it would have been better off as a multi-part podcast where they could fully go into the different storylines such as the murder and the sisters in each of the triplet’s adopted family. The movie also felt rather slanted and while I agree with the side it took, it would have been good to hear a little more from the other side and justifications for the experiments. A few thoughts on this extremely compelling movie.  Can't get it out of my head.",0
1575,"1.  I suspect that the psychologist rationalized the study something like ""they'll never know what they are missing (by not growing up with their twins/siblings), and we'll gain insight into \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (whatever they were studying).""  Obviously morally wrong to most people, but consistent with his (the psychologist's) own self-interest.   This flaw in human nature is understudied and ripe for development.  ",0
1576,"2. If I were jewish, adopted, and grew up within 150 miles of NYC, I'd be thinking about whether people came to my house and filmed/tested me on a periodic basis.",0
1577,"3. My take on the nature/nurture question is that the nature part (all were wrestlers, smoked, had great smiles, etc.) was somewhat generic, maybe on the superficial side.   Listening to their wives and why they liked one or the other, listening to the triplets themselves, listening to the discussions about why Eddy committed suicide, reveals that they were clearly different personalities.  That's only one dimension of each one's uniqueness.  One other key aspect is the nurturing aspect of love.  We don't have enough data to say too much conclusively, but I came away with a stronger conviction than ever that it's critical to love your people with all your heart.   That doesn't mean discipline should or shouldn't be part of the equation.",0
1578,"4. Even identical twins and triplets brought up by the same parents have different personalities, different ways of addressing challenges in their lives, and different ways of expressing and receiving love.   So it's hard to believe the motivation behind the study was nature/parenting related nurture alone because even when circumstances are such that the children should develop close to identically if it's possible at all, they don't.   ",0
1579,"5. Perhaps the reason why we haven't seen a study report is that it takes a lifetime (and maybe more!) to understand the full ramifications of the different upbringings.   At one point the psychologist probably became too old to continue, the study participants became to old and self aware to participate in these tests and observations without being brought in to what was going on.  And of course when the triplets found each other, it would have disturbed any findings from then on anyway.   ",0
1580,"6. One other consideration is that the study organizers may at one point have become aware of their own potential liability and decided to fade away quietly. To answer question 3, the research assistant is Natasha Josefowitz. I had never heard of her, but she is interesting. She is 91 and continues to lead an engaged life (I mean, how many 90 year olds have their own personal website?). But, eh, I don't even want to touch upon how complicit she might have been in the brothers' mistreatment. I mean, she was new in the field, it wasn't her study, it seemed like a good idea at the time, etc. Ok, I guess I just ""touched upon it"". Still, a very interesting life, and a good addition to the film:",0

1584,"""Towards the end of Three Identical Strangers, the boys’ aunt says something striking: 'Coming from the Holocaust, our family has a knowledge that when you play with humans, you do something very wrong.'"" Saw it yesterday.  I thought it was great.  I really like how the film just laid everything out there and left the viewer to draw their own conclusions.  I thought it was interesting that the excuse the research assistant used about it ""being a different time"" for why they thought it was ok to separate the children.  Jesus - it was ok to screw with people's lives with a secret research experiment in the united states only 50 years ago?  That doesn't hold water.  These people - especially Neubaur - were messed up.  I would still like to know what they were trying to learn.  When they revealed that first placing a single adoptee into the families a few years prior to the separated twins being placed there was a part of the experiement it showed  how mind-numbingly manipulative of everyone involved they were.  These were professionals that were supposed to observe human subject protocols.  Damn, the more I think about it, the angrier I get.  How can anything else this ""world renowned"" scientist did in his life be worth anything after the ethical lapses exposed in this film? What I don't understand is, why did one triplet go to a college as a freshman where his brother had already been there a year as a freshman.  They're the exact same age.   Did the parents hold Eddie back a year?  Did he take a year off.  That wasn't really covered. Just saw this today and it has stuck with me the rest of the evening. What a great film/story.  ",0
1585,"1.  I have to think he thought it was a totally justifiable experiment but I too found the nazi similarity interesting. He had clearly different motives for his research, but ultimately didn't hesitate to experiment on humans too. IMO the experiment is heinous, but I think the idea might have merit. What if you could conclusively determine how to be a better parent and how to provide the nurture that seems so important.  But that is moot if you dont complete or publish your research. I found that the hardest to digest. He already did the awful part, why not publish?",0
1586,"2.  I felt like it's too hard to say definitively that nurture wins over nature, but I think the be as t conclusion I would draw is nurture is a vital part. I think there are SO MANY questions left unanswered, but the most important one is who was involved that still doesn't know they were?",0
1587,"3.  I thought I was going to, but ultimately no. I get the idea that we can't fully judge decisions made in the past with our morals or ideals of the present, BUT even in present day she seemed to not really care about the negative of their research. ",0
1588,"4.  That's a hard question. I enjoyed the film immensely, but I guess my favorite part is when you find out they're going to get access to the research. ",0
1589,"5.  I did, a lot.  ",0
1590,"6.  I guess it depends on if your potential twin also did DNA testing.   I hope people realize that this is a grain of salt on the tip of the iceberg when it comes to human experiments in our current society.  Having bipolar disorder and coming from an unstable environment I often wonder if my disorder would have ever come to the full fruition that it has if I had a more stable and less abusive environment.  So during the film my thoughts varied as each layer of the story unfolded.  When they introduced the female twins and pointed out the similarities for both groups I felt comforted - in that I was always going to be this way and I have no control over it and it's okay. Then they went on to focus on Eddy and the differences between the triplets and I went back to thinking ""well, maybe I would have a different outcome if so and so hadn't happened during my early development and adolescent"".   It reminded me a lot of ACES if anyone has ever studied or applied that to the work they do (I work with youth). ",0
1591,"I wonder if Louis Wise Services ever expected anyone would find each other naturally.  I'm just going to put this out there...  This film is constructed so tightly that there doesn't seem to be a single unnecessary scene.  So why do they spend time showing the Research Assistant's photos with all these powerful politicians?  More to the point, how has this one random woman been able to meet all of these powerful people?",0
1592,"So what is the director of this very tightly-constructed story trying to tell us through that digression? Didn’t like the research assistant. She seemed to happy to have met all those crazy liberal people. What they did was fucked but I don’t think it had anything to do with Eddy’s death. In general I feel the stuff in that research is probably worthless except for the identities of those twins involved. Otherwise I doubt they gained any masterful knowledge from watching toddlers draw pictures. I think Eddy’s death was a result of them getting famous and him not being able to handle it.  So well done and interesting!!!! I was shocked many times in the film, I hope this gets traction for awards!  It's interesting how when I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it was a fun, crazy story of three triplets separated by birth who found each other later in life. I figured this meant that they were adopted by different families who were never told about being triplets, but what didn't occur to me is that this would be inhumane. I'm sure I'm not totally alone here. ",0
1593,"I feel like after watching this documentary, it's pretty clear that separating them had a huge negative effect on them, but like the woman involved in the experiment's said, I would have never thought that it would be a really bad thing to do. However, I don't know much about psychology in that area. It is a really interesting study and I see why they would want to do this experiment, I just wish it could have been performed in a more humane way. Anyone else have thoughts on this? Which kid was responsible for the murder? Was it Eddy? because that would help explain the suicide. Unless they're a sociopath I'm sure they feel deep regret over that as an adult. Otherwise decent people can do fucked up shit as a kid, especially when they're consumed in a world of peer pressure, and drugs. ",0
1594,"Not saying any murderer deserves forgiveness or empathy, but I'm sure there are plenty of adults out there that got peer pressured towards being involved in something fucked up as a kid and it haunts them to this day.",0
1595,"Both the assistants gave me a very bad vibe, also I hate to say it but Eddy's father. I mean obviously he's a very old man, but he just seemed to lack emotion. He said he'd wish he had taught Eddie more things, but one of the conclusions of the story was how important growing up in a nurturing environment is. The most important lesson in life is to love yourself first, and when you grow up around strict parents that are never satisfied and show little emotion that can make that difficult.",0

1598,"**Description**: We see footage of the Apollo 11 launch but all of it takes place inside the cockpit mostly focused on Armstrong's face and through the windows. At the end there's a few brief shots of Armstrong coming out of the lander, a panoramic view of the lunar surface, and a shot of Armstrong on the moon. The scene in the catacombs - kicked off by Simon Pegg as a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude - followed by no less than 6 additional consecutive twists, nearly made my head explode.  Didn't expect the fake John Lark to almost defeat both Hunt and Walker in the bathroom. ""The last thing that goes through your mind will be your kneecaps.""",0
1599,I laughed pretty hard. Kudos to the filmmakers for not taking the easy out and making Julia's husband one of the Apostles or something. As soon as I saw Wes Bentley I thought that's the angle they were going for.,0
1600,The action scenes were all top notch in this. Especially the fight scenes. That bathroom brawl is probably the best fight scene of the year. Also nice to see Lane getting to fight this time.,0
1601,Cavill made a good villain. He's got a good steely gaze with those icy blues. And we got to see Superman become Two-Face.,0
1602,"The rest of the cast were reliable as always. Ferguson kicked ass and Ving had a strong scene with her, acting wise. Also did not expect Alec Baldwin getting into a fight with Henry Cavill.",0
1603,"If they keep making M:I films this good, I'll keep watching them until Tom Cruise is aggressively wheeling his wheelchair after the latest villain.",0
1604,"My one little quibble: if Walker was Lark, why almost kill himself with the storm Halo Jump? Unless he was just screwing with Ethan the whole time. Best use of Wolf Blitzer in a movie yet.  I like how Ethan didn't actually know how to fly the helicopter - he was just winging it. I just assumed from the trailer and behind the scenes videos that flying helicopters was simply another unexplained skill of Ethan's.",0
1605,"Edit: Also the sound in this movie was fucking awesome, the gunshots in particular. The three scenes that come to mind include the early shootout over the plutonium, when Ethan kills the Widow's men protecting the cop, and Walker pulling out the FN Para in the helicopter.  That nuclear bomb / sunset fakeout though... Props to whoever made that first trailer. That's where the hype started. Honestly, my absolute favourite moment in the movie must be the payoff after Walker said ""People really fall for this shit?"" in reference to the masks. Love me some foreshadowing like that. I legitimately think this is the perfect action movie. The writing is incredible, the choreography and cinematography are top notch, every character is well acted and delivers when called upon. I was so jazzed when I left the theater. I want to see it again so very badly. Somehow, it’s the best movie in this series by a long shot, and Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation we’re also fantastic, so that’s really saying something Who knew Ethan's rock climbing skills would eventually pay off. Does this make Mission Impossible 2's opening scene the greatest piece of foreshadowing in film history? My god that helicopter scene. I swear my jaw dropped like 5 separate times. That movie was an absolute blast. Shoutout to whoever the fuck the Apostles hired to fill in for John Lark...dude 1v2'd Ethan Hunt and Walker after already being knocked unconscious. ",0
1606,"Absolute legend. RIP brother.  Call it cheesy, but I love how they set up action events in this movie.  The frequent close-ups of the red hook lets you know early on that it is significant, and at a certain point you realize that it’s definitely gonna hit Henry Cavill in the face.",0
1607,"But despite knowing it’s coming, it’s still an amazing moment.  The setup delivers a payoff, and a satisfying one at that. You guys remember that scene when tom cruise and henry cavill get struck ***by fuckin lightning*** as they fell through a storm? haha holy shit this movie was nuts. I could gush about this movie all night but one thing stood out to me. Before Ethan jumps out the window in London, one of the office workers gives him a nod basically saying ""You got this"". ",0
1608,"I couldn't stop laughing at how random and great that was.  Has anybody else pointed out that Henry Cavil's character is named ""Walker"" and he did not run once? I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of the mask reveals.  Wait, is Vanessa Kirby's character (The White Widow) the daughter of Vanessa Redgrave's Max character from the first movie? Because I rewatched the series during the last week, and the chemistry between Ethan and Max was still surprisingly good. “Sloan was right, the IMF are just like Halloween. Just a bunch of kids wearing...”",0
1609,I fucking love this movie. This movie has one of the best car/bike chases I’ve seen. The whole thing just kept on going. It also made me realise how many directors use score and music over action scenes. I loved how we just got natural sound design throughout the scene. Bathroom fight scene was way too short. Should've been like 2 hours longer Thanks Tom Cruise for constantly risking your life for our enjoyment. My god this scratches an itch like few other.  Was anyone else pleasantly surprised by the outcome of that bathroom fight? I love how the trailers set that conflict up as Walker's bad ass punch out scene but the movie result is the opponent laying both him and Ethan out. ,0
1610,Also when Ethan tried dropping the payload on Walker's helicopter but missed terribly. It's those kind of developments that show the good guys aren't always on their A game and only enhances the entire movie experience in my opinion,0
1611,"I thought it was fantastic! I was tearing up constantly, particularly when he invited Officer Clemens, to wash his feet with him, then they showed the context of the chemicals being thrown in pools. The juxtaposition of that video with Mr Rogers’ pure kindness and care brought me to tears.",0
1612,"I also loved the ending, beautifully crafted by the director so that the audience realizes what’s happening as the people close to Mr Rogers reflect during that minute, and us in the audience reflect ourselves.",0
1613,"Nobody in my theater stood up immediately. I think it’s because nobody wanted to leave the comfort of Mr Rogers’ neighborhood and go back into the divided world we live in now. But I think this documentary came at a perfect time, because we could all learn a little from Mr Rogers right now. I found this pretty challenging honestly. I went in expecting it to be a retrospective and nostalgic look at how we need Mr. Rogers in today's divided culture, but the end it asks ""What are you going to do to carry on what he did?""",0
1614,I found that really powerful. Mr. Rogers kept coming back to television later in his life due to a personal responsibility he felt. We shouldn't need Mr. Rogers to come back because we saw him teaching it all to us. So that we can be the change. ,0
1615,"Just something that really hung with me. Francoise's realization that Mr. Rogers had been telling him he loved him for 2 years, and saying that that was the first time he'd been told that by another man, was heartbreaking. For some reason, seeing them both as older men yet Francoise viewing him as his surrogate father really got to me. I really liked that Mr. Rogers wasn't portrayed as a perfect saint, they included his failures, depression, and self-doubt. The use of the footage of him on a Nantucket beach to portray him briefly succumbing to his self-doubt, then standing back up and continuing to move forward was very powerful. > After Credits Scene? Yes, Paddington recruits Mr. Rogers into the nicecore universe",0
1616,"A man of culture who reads David Ehrlich as well, I see I saw this movie the day the Koko the Gorilla died. A lot of people in my theater very audibly were touched a lot by her small part in the film. Absolutely incredible film  Started crying about two minutes in, cried through the rest of the movie. Just an absolute wreck. I know he wasn't a perfect man, but honestly, he was such a good man, and an important man. Watching this movie just felt so special and lovely. ""Was I a mistake?""",0
1617,"Cue the tears So many beautiful scenes. When Daniel asks ""What does assassination mean?"", I immediately teared up. You could just feel the tragedy behind that episode and how everykone felt watching it. Especially since they made such a point of showing that Mr. Rogers showed himself in Daniel -- he himself truly had trouble comprehending why someone would assassinate.",0
1618,"Also, the scene when Daniel sings about his insecurities of being ""a mistake"" and Lady Aberlin joins in with a song about how she loves him for who he is was amazing, sad yet beautiful. The harmony they formed was actually chilling. The scene where he looks straight at the camera and says something to the effect of “people are telling you what you need to be. And they are wrong. I will tell you”. Man. What a wholesome badass The one case of learning how the sausage gets made that actually makes you want more sausage.",0
1619,I didn't want this movie to end. - Tissues were at the theater door. They knew.,0
1620,"- Mom left dry-eyed, but enjoyed the movie. She was confused at why I wanted to see this, having not really paid much attention to Mister Rogers' Neighborhood when I was a kid. I told her the best way I could explain it was that my generation tends to look for tangible moral heroes, especially now, and Fred Rogers is a famous example of someone we want to see more of.",0
1621,"- I didn't cry as much as I thought I would (the trailer made me tear up, so I was prepping to be a sobbing mess), but it did happen. Clemmons' story of his loneliness when coming out, Fred Rogers telling him to keep his homosexuality a secret, and then stating ""I love you"" for two years to him broke me. Did anyone else feel like they glossed over that just a tad? Did Rogers ever state his specific feelings on homosexuality?",0
1622,- It astounded me that Rogers was still unsure if he was a good person at the end. ,0
1623,"- The main thing that made Fred Rogers the most relatable is how unsure he was about himself. He had done all this good, and felt he hadn't done enough. ",0
1624,"- I got a twinge of anger at the protest at his funeral and the jabs at his effeminacy. Like, just . . . why? It's also good for this movie to come out to show a registered Republican who was a Christian who saw the good in people. God, why can't we have that anymore?",0
1625,- Oh Daniel. I miss you. >Your Tears as Constantly Happening,0
1626,"Great casting choice. When Daniel asked if he was a mistake, I lost it because that duet with Lady Aberlin was so beautiful and it was something I needed to hear especially since I suffer from anxiety and worry and when I took a minute to think about the special people in my life, I sobbed so so much. ",0
1627,"Thank you Mr Rogers for loving everyone so much There Will Be Tears  Ugly crying everywhere in my theatre by the end. Tried to hold strong, but between Fred Rogers  actually experiencing doubt after 9/11 and the story behind Daniel Tiger and a whole bunch of other stuff I just couldn’t. Beautifully executed documentary that ended up being the warm hug I need right now. Things are fucked up right now.  I bet Fred Rogers, Bob Ross, Julia Child, Steve Irwin, Jim Henson, Bob Keeshan (Captain Kangaroo), and Sheri Lewis (And her friend Lamb Chop) are all having a friendly conversation and having alot of fun with each other in the afterlife.  All seven of them were childhood icons for each generation and makes me sad that kids of today won't experience these type of people again. Especially since they were all so kind and are hard to dislike and were all were one of a kind that's missing from today's television. ",0
1628,Can't wait for the upcoming Mr Rogers movie with Tom Hanks as Fred Rogers.,0
1629," The news interviewer talking to Daniel, then saying something like ""that's really something"" was an unexpected little wholesome moment. His eyes were gleaming and he had a genuine smile, I feel like I saw his childhood self come back. While I find the movie amazing and definitely recommend it to anyone interested, it still hurts to see that even someone like Mr. Rogers didn’t know how to fully comprehend the magnitude of 9/11 when it happened. It really was tough as someone to watch that considering that’s the time when we needed someone like him the most. Spoiler: Mr. Rogers was a stand up guy.  Saw it Tuesday and it was an interesting look not only for television history, but American history as well. Between talking about Vietnam the first week on the air, Mr. Rogers and Officer Clemons in the pool, and Daniel Tiger asking about the word assassination, it was crazy to see how much was mature subjects were covered.  ",0
1630,"Also, holy crap, that scene where Daniel references depression was a solid gut punch. Was not anticipating that and it really stuck out to me the most It really struck out to me that even Fred Rogers had his doubts on occasion. He wondered if he was making a difference, if he was doing a great job, if he could adjust properly. It goes to show that he too was human, and that we **can** strive to be like him even if we doubt ourselves. Wonderful film. Two observations:",0
1631,"I've been in many films where the audience spontaneously applauded at the end but I've been in very few where they spontaneously applauded at some point in the middle of the film, but when they showed the clip of Mr. Rogers convincing Senator Pastore to continue funding for PBS the audience broke out into applause.",0
1632,"I was previously familiar with the significance of Mr. Rogers sharing a pool with Officer Clemmons on the show but it was only when watching the clip and watching Mr. Rogers wash Clemmons' feet that I remembered that washing the feet of the apostles is one of the acts Jesus performs in the gospels.  I don't know if that's what Mr. Rogers was thinking of when he did that but it made me realize just how much he lived in imitation of Christ. If that last scene didn’t bring you to tears, you have no soul.  I love how people in my theater snapped in time with Mr. Rogers while he was singing ""It's such a Good Feeling"". That was heart warming to hear. ",0
1633,"Maybe it's the nostalgia, maybe it's the current political climate we're living in, or maybe it's because I've had a really rough couple of months (mentally and emotionally) but man, was I overwhelmed with emotions. ",0
1634,"Earlier in the year, I had a hard time convincing myself that I wasn't a failure. I would go into intense crying fits before going to sleep, repeating things like ""I can't do it, I can't do it"", and I was making life much more difficult than it had to be. So seeing these archived clips of Mr. Rogers' wisdom and songs just hit me right in the heart. ",0
1635,"I have a great supportive family and friends, but it was something else hearing this good man lend his encouragement and love. Selfishly, I really needed this and I'm so happy Morgan Neville made this film. I haven't had a movie experience like this in a long time.",0
1636,"The best part was Max getting hyped as fuck over Cole losing his virginity. The movie is basically Bee shipping her two favorite charges together and that's hilarious The scene where Melanie kills her dad reminded me of Monty Python Max shirtless with his name tag on killed me I laughed pretty hard at the “not even mad” line. I didn’t love the >!turning Melanie bad completely out of nowhere twist!<,but I got used to it. Robbie Amell is the highlight. He knows what movie he is in and kills it. Also is it me or did >!Samara Weaving look a bit off?!<Not sure if it was a wig or if she has lost weight or what, but her face looked different which was especially obvious when they flashed back toward the end. Overall, I thought it was a decent sequel, obviously not as good as the out of nowhere first film. not as good as the first one. The kills were not as creative as the first (two decapitations and two exploding). the parents side plot was a bit meh. there are also some plot holes that I saw that are already mentioned by others. but I enjoyed it overall.",0
1637,"also I got distracted by the lead for the first few minutes of the movie a bit, he kinda looks like he could be Hailee Steinfelds twin. Not as good as the first, but still a fun watch.",0
1638,"Max is probably one of the most fun villains in horror films in the last few years.  Absolutely love how he legitimately is proud of Cole and wants to make him into a stronger person, but is also a Psycho killer and constantly wants to also murder him.",0
1639,"Robbie Amell absolutely kills it haha.  Really, the cast is fantastic for these films.  Can't wait to see a third one, but I hope the writing is a bit stronger for it. My idea for The Babysitter 3:",0
1640,"It's been three years since the events of Killer Queen and Cole and Phoebe are still dating in college. Cole has somewhat gotten over his PTSD from the events of the first two movies and he has really fallen in love with Phoebe; so much so that he plans to propose to her at the end of the school year. In contrast, Pheobe is still kinda freaked out by the events of Killer Queen but she is seeming to get through it due to Cole's support. Everything seems relatively normal until Phoebe keeps on seeing Bee in random places(At the mall, the college hall, in her house etc). Cole tries to assure her by telling she disintegrated all those years ago and that they are safe. Then, poof! The cult (including Jimmy, Diego and Melanie) somehow return. Cole and Phoebe obviously get in defensive stances, worried that they will be sacrificed again. But surprisingly, the cult doesn't want to hurt them. In fact, Hell has changed them and they don't want anyone to go through the hell of being a cultist or a sacrifice. They inform Cole and Phoebe that the Book of Satan wasn't destroyed and it has somehow fallen into the wrong hands again.(Someone at the college has it)",0
1641,A new cult has risen and Cole/Pheobe and the original cult have to stop them.,0
1642,"Continuing on the theme of hard work from Killer Queen, each cultist will realise that they didn't need a deal with the devil to achieve their dreams/wishes. John finds out he's funny, Max realizes he can just join the military to kill people(Would make for a good joke), Melanie and Cole make up etc. Unexpectedly, the cult and Cole/Phoebe start bonding.",0
1643,"Just like in Killer Queen,",0
1644,"Bee makes a cameo at the end. She legitimately became Phoebe's guardian angel because she was sent to purgatory, not hell and was cleaned of her sins.",0
1645,"What do you think? [deleted] Would definitely watch another one. This is the kind of shit that I expect from a cheap, crazy, B-Movie and I am not one bit disappointed. Netflix originals where they just let them run wild like this could be really cool. I think I'll look for more of those from now on. I fucking knew they were hiding Samara Weaving from us!! Just finished watching it. The set up wasn't as interesting but it does pick up after they get to the lake. It's not as good as the first film but its a decent watch. I was surprised that all of the cast returned even the main lead. [deleted] Just like the first movie I went in blind expecting garbage and was surprised that it was actually engaging. I felt the betrayal just as much as the main character. Most of the jokes didn’t land, but callback jokes actually got me giggling. This movie is over the top with its stylized “What The Fuck” moments, gore, and acting. A caricature of a slasher teen movie that isn’t exactly a spoof is what this movie is to me. 6/10 for the plot, 8/10 for a Sam Raimi-esk attempt. I actually really liked it. It's fucking nuts. The craziness of the first movie has been cranked up to the max. I kind of like when a movie goes balls to the wall.",0
1646,"Only complaint would really be Melanie turning evil because she wants to be... an influencer. Comes out of nowhere and then she tells Cole ""You know I've always wanted to be an influencer."" Okay, but the audience didn't. That and her friend group is very odd to me. Like Idk how that group came to be.",0
1647,"Honestly, I hope they make another. The shit's fun. Not sure why the critics are being so hard on it. ",0
1648,I enjoyed it as much as the first one. ,0
1649,But King Bach and Robbie Amell are honestly so funny in these. And I’m not usually a fan of theirs. ,0
1650,Max (Amell) -being hyped for Cole and just wanting to murder people is somewhat wholesome and Heart warming),0
1651,John (Bach) - I cracked up when he attempted to accept Jesus as his lord and savior while he was being burned alive for participating in the death blood cult lol These movies are fun as fuck. Campy as hell and a joy to watch,0
1652,"I hope they do actually make a 3rd one. There’s a sequel?! With the whole cast from the first film?! Hell yes. I absolutely loved the first one, and had no clue a sequel was even green lit. Really fun movie to watch on a Saturday night in a Netflix party. Sit back, have a couple drinks and laugh your ass off. Not every movie needs to have a deep, philosophical plot. ",0
1653,Every single scene with Robbie Amell had me rolling,0
1654,"6/10 if you criticise it as simply a movie but I got 10/10 enjoyment from this. i was super confused at the high school crew they had in this one, Cole, the neighbor chick, jock and two chubby latino's who i assumed were brother and sister until they killed her. Didn't make much sense until we found out they were in the cult too so thats what brought them together.  ",0
1655,"Also i know this is a comedy but how was Cole not believed for what happened, two cops disappeared after going to his house in the first one, same with a parametic, the babysitter disappeared and I assume he gave the names of the original cult crew who had since disappeared. Just strange nobody believed him when like 7 people would now be missing. It’s not as good as the first movie, but I didn’t find it terrible. It started off slow, in my opinion, but once everyone got to the house boat, the movie picked up and I enjoyed myself through to the end. Jenna Ortega and shirtless (again) Robbie Amell really steal the movie. Jenna Ortega is going to get type cast as overly edgy teens.  Tbf i can see why Melanie became a villain. Her mother was a deadbeat, her father was a neglectful douche who cared more about his car than his daughter. The events of the first film probably didn't help. She probably also has tramua.(well probably much lesser than Cole's tramua since he was the main target, but nevertheless Bee tried to kill her too)",0
1656,I think her becoming an influencer wasn't just a meta joke or lazy writing. I think she wanted to have a billion fans because it could replace all the neglect and lack of love her father gave her. And it is clear that she would do anything to get that; even betraying her childhood best friend and becoming the leader of a Satanic cult.,0
1657,"She's kind of a tragic villain really. I enjoyed both films just fine.  After watching this one, I thought... ""well, how are they going to make it so he was just crazy this time?  His dad was there.""",0
1658,...And then I realized his dad is also high.,0
1659,"I loved the part where he kept trying to say his backstory to people and they'd just die Bob Odenkirk, Christopher Lloyd, and RZA are probably the strangest action combo I can think of. It’s going to be hard to beat this movie. ",0
1660,"It’s John Wick for the tired working class. It throws realism out of the window, and replaces it with hilariously over the top spectacle and set to a better score somehow. Odenkirk is father of the year. ",0
1661,"It’s like the perfect “mediocre” movie, but it does everything better than what came before. It’s violent, stylish, there’s even some brutal gore. Don’t even get me started on the comedic timing. It’s amazing. Not mediocre at all. ",0
1662,There is no: “all hope is lost moment” everytime you settle in for the familiar it says: “fuck it” and has more fun. Tropes are introduced but cast aside. It never stops. It’s just great. ,0
1663,"Didn’t know what to expect, but with the intro I assumed it would be soooo subpar. I was very wrong. What a great movie to return to theaters for. Watch it. Watch it twice. Finally, a fight that is actually anything but one-sided. That fight on the bus was amazing. Nice to see how limited space can’t keep one from getting hit, no matter how skilled he is. He was punched, stabbed, kicked, and thrown out of a window. Nice to see the hero take some damage for a change. I loved the final sequence. RZA's triple headshot was great as well as when he shot the rifle backwards over his shoulder and let the recoil hit the guy in front of him. Loved this movie. Went in not knowing or expecting anything, got an incredible action thriller that left me feeling exhilarated. Really hope a ton of people watch and enjoy it",0
1664,Also was lucky enough to see in theaters. First movie since the pandemic. Fantastic,0
1665,"edit: also YNWA was perfect. All I know is that I need a Christopher Lloyd x RZA buddy cop film now All of this could've prevented if the wife or kids took the trash out every once in a while. I’m not sure if it was just Bob Odenkirk doing crazy shit, but this movie had my dying laughing. Each kill got more insane and when Christopher Lloyd came out at the end to save him... tears. Amazing I thought it was okay. I went to go see it because it was called ""Nobody"" and I'm a nobody. But in the end, it turned out he was actually a somebody, so I couldn't relate to it anymore. I loved it. I hope those who can’t make it to theaters discover it on demand. I hope it gets a sequel. It started out as John Wick and ended up as Home Alone. RZA's sniper beatdown was epic. I loved that recoil hit.",0
1666,"It was really quite creative for what I expected to be a John Wick copy- I might even prefer this. Also, Yulian's dancing was pretty fun. This was a lot of fun. I think it works better when it's just Odenkirk brutally beating dudes to a pulp, where all you can hear are the punches and groans and whimpers, (that bus scene got me giddy in a way an action scene hasn't in quite some time) and it falters a bit with the more fast paced gunplay stuff towards the end. Christopher Lloyd is absolutely hilarious though.",0
1667,"Odenkirk has proved that he's a more charismatic and cooler action star than most acting today. Really would love to see him do more work like this. This movie is fucking awesome. Christopher Lloyd's character was amazing. Bob Odenkirk and RZA killed as well. I need a sequel. Michael Ironsides got big, I couldn’t understand Christopher Lloyd, that fight on the bus was awesome and I want a Nobody John Wick team up movie. That scene where Christopher Lloyd's character pretended to be asleep when the thugs got into his nursing home room but was ready with the shotgun was pretty awesome! How is nobody talking about that absolutely ridiculous amazing claymore kill at the end? ",0
1668,"Also I feel like the triple headshot had a very call of duty esque vibe to it. Loved it! Saw it tonight, enjoyed it a lot. Bob and the other cast are awesome.",0
1669,"Also, the timing's perfect, 1,5  hours went pretty quickly.",0
1670,"As a Russian, also liked to see real Russian actors (their looks, with no accent, real funny speech, etc). Not sure if Americans can tell the difference - let me know, please if it was easier to believe them in comparison to 'fake bad Russians in other movies. Great flick!  The only question I have is that if Bob Odenkirk is supposed to be a redacted superspy then why did he have a tattoo on his wrist that was easily recognizable to the Vietnam Veteran? I’m never going to look at a kitty cat bracelet the same way again I’m calling it!",0
1671,"The sequel will be called “No Bodies.” My girlfriend yelled, ""Not the Lasagna "" and it made the movie for me! Just came out of a drive in showing. Holy moly was this a monster of a movie. Nice sequel setup. Odenkirk was killing it all throughout. Missed big crowdpleasers like these. When he’s got the wire wrapped around the dudes neck on the bus and every time he punches them the “stop requested” sign lights up. Comedy gold",0
1672,"I loved the small *Verfremdungseffekt* scenes, such as Rosenthaler switching actors ""on stage"" to show time passing, or the ""frozen"" tableaux where the actors are clearly struggling to keep still.",0
1673,"Also, I'm of course glad I saw it in the cinema, but more than once I wished I could freeze the frame to really see and take in everything that was going on. There was just so much visual information that I got overwhelmed sometimes.",0
1674,"EDIT: I don't understand how Anderson could write and direct a whole movie as a love letter to *The New Yorker* and NOT (unless I missed something) include a single example of the correct use of diaereses that they are so famous for (like in the word ""coöperation""). Feel that with this Adrien Brody has kind of become the most important actor in Anderson's troupe, he fits perfectly in and kind of gives the most nuanced and varied performances. Bill Murray is just there because, frankly no more than Michael Caine in Nolan's films these days. Cast Jeffrey Wright in every Wes Anderson movie from now on, please. For anyone familiar with French movies from the 50s to 70s, this is an absolute feast of references and homages:",0

1681,"If anyone has the exact quote, please me know",0
1682,"EDIT: actual quote courtesy of u/whoabeveragehere “A weakness in cartography: the curse of the homosexual” I had never seen a Wes Anderson movie before The French Dispatch, bought a ticket just to see what all the fuss was about.",0
1683,I was blown away with how beautiful the cinematography was. I’ve since watched a few more Wes Anderson films but I think this is still his best just because the intricate details and carefully assembled sets work really well when you imagine them in the pages of the New Yorker. The dollhouse like care that he assembles every scene with is mirrored perfectly with the meticulously curated words that are used for the articles in the New Yorker.,0
1684,"I think the Rollingstone review said that you have to watch the movie twice to see it once, and while I thought that was a pretentious take after reading it, in rewatching different clips and scenes from the movie I think that was actually an apt observation. Knowing what’s going on let’s you focus on all of the other details that are sprinkled into the film, from the geometry of how the actors are positioned to the rapid fire dialogue. ",0
1685,"I saw some people criticize the fact that the anthology seemed unlinked, but I think it’s best thought of a meditation on loneliness (which, after watching more Wes Anderson, seems to be a recurrent theme for him). From the loneliness of the artist, to the loneliness of the journalist covering the student movement, to the loneliness of the chef (paired with the loneliness of the journalist covering him), all explore them in different ways, somewhat resolving with the community of journalists that The French Dispatch has created, but also with the knowledge that the problem was there before the events of the movie and will exist after the events of the movie. I think Jeffrey Wright will be the latest actor that now gets cast in every one of Wes Anderson's films. His voice delivering those lines just fitted so well. A perfect match. Don't forget Christoph Waltz as ... whoever he was for about 32 seconds. Great cast, somewhat emotionally cold, but still charming. The Owen Wilson segment was my favorite, wish the film had smaller articles in between the big ones, or given at least some info on the group of writers.",0
1686,"Technically some of the most brilliant artistry I've seen in a while, the city waking up, the tour of the city, and the third section were just incredible visual highlights. Roebuch Wright, played by Wright, was also one of the better recent Anderson characters.",0
1687,"I'd say it's somewhere in the middle of his filmography and not something I'll watch again, but I'm glad I saw it. Overall I enjoyed it but the stories are a mixed bag. More of my impressions on the individual stories below:",0
1688,"The first story was by far my favorite. Benicio, Lea, Brody and Swinton played their parts perfectly. With the exception of Jeffrey Wright's and Saoirse Ronan's characters in the third story this is the only story where I had an emotional attachment to the characters. Benicio and Lea's chemistry is great. Their relationship and how it is developed is so well done given the time restraint. Brody is fantastic and I loved every bit of his time on screen. Swinton is perfect as always and injects a lot of great  humor. Even the bit parts played by Henry Winkler and others were very amusing. I honestly would have been happy with a feature length version of this story because all the various characters were fascinating, the story was compelling and the story within a story format was done so well. The segment, imo, in the movie where  Wes' style, including the random changes to color, both complimented and enhanced the story instead of overshadowing it. ",0
1689,"The second story really fell flat for me. This is probably the first time I didn't enjoy a Timothée Chalamet performance. Unlike the more natural performances from Frances McDormand or the young french woman who plays his counterpart, it felt like Tim was acting the entire time. The outbursts and confusion that Brody lands so well didn't land the same when Tim was trying to pull it off, imo. And in general I didn't find any of the character motivations or the story in general that interesting. Christoph Waltz's cameo felt pointless. I enjoyed the diner scene but otherwise I was relieved when this segment ended.",0
1690,"The third story was both fascinating and overwhelming. So many highlights like Roebuck Wright, the brief interaction between Roebuck and Albert 'the abacus', the scene between Saoirse Ronan's character and the kid,  the car chase, and the convo between Roebuck and Nescaffier (the film's emotional payoff). However, the events  were so damn rushed. It felt like Wes did a speedrun through an entire film in this one segment so it was difficult to attach to  The Commissaire's  or The Chauffeur's (Norton) motivations. I would have loved a whole feature length subplot with Ronan and the kid's character since their brief relationship was done so well done but oh well. By far the highlight was Jeffrey Wright's fantastic performance. Arguably the best written and acted character in the film and this role immediately became one of my favorite of Wright's performances. I hope he get nominated for awards because I think it was that great. Like someone else mentioned I can totally see him becoming a regalar in Wes' films since he handles his dialogue jut as well as or arguably better than any other of his regulars. Lea Seydoux has better chemistry with Benecio Del Toro  in what amounts to a pretty absurd story than she does with Daniel Craig in a mega-franchise movie where their love is a major plot point. That shot where Timothy Charlemet and the french girl where arguing about the artist and the he plays a song by them on the jukebox had my jaw dropped I don't think I ever been so entranced by a shot before and I don't really completely know what specifically I found so cool about it. The high stakes car chase turning into a foot race, then suddenly returning right back to where the car chase left off might have been the hardest I've laughed in a good long time!",0
1691,"Despite enjoying the film, I was buying into the common complaint thrown at it that (due to the anthology nature) it lacked the emotion of Anderson's previous films. But jeez, that last segment with Roebuck hit me like a goddamn train, proving me quite wrong.",0
1692,"His moment with the chef that he deemed ""too sad"" and his explanation for why he loved the dining experience were honestly beautiful in how it portrayed what it was like being alone in a foreign place (not to mention the extra layers of his homosexuality and race), and finding comfort in the place one might least expect.",0
1693,"There definitely wasn't a bad segment among them (I'd still put the Manifesto one towards the bottom though, personally), but I could see myself returning to that particular story again for that perfect mix of (literal) cartoon humor and bittersweet emotions. Could watch a whole feature length movie of Jeffrey Wright's character talking about food ",0
1694,"Amazing performance My favorite scene in the whole movie was actually the one right at the beginning with the town “coming alive”. You really felt the bustle building up slowly and then reaching a full crescendo. That was awesome. If you read long form journalistic magazines, this film is a love letter and parody simultaneously. ",0
1695,I remember reading a 15 page article in the New Yorker about the cultivation of beans and being incredibly interested despite laughing at the idea beforehand. That sensation of diving into a piece of writing and trusting the writer to tell you a story is perfectly captured in this film. ,0
1696,"The episodic nature of the story obviously matches a magazines structure. But it matches the jarring way you go from Politics to Art to Food with the only connecting thread being that you are the type of reader to enjoy this type of magazine and you trust the magazine and the writers to be interesting. I’ve liked all of Wes Anderson’s films, but maybe this was a bit too much Wes Anderson. It was fine but I don’t think I have much desire to re-watch it like I do with the rest of his movies.",0
1697,I probably would have enjoyed it more if they were released as short films.,0
1698,"The tiny bit of stop motion claymation special effects in the middle of the live action shootout scene was such a neat touch. The whole film felt like I rushed through a modern art museum in a foreign country: I appreciate the beautiful things I saw, but I am not sure what to think of them as a whole. This was a really delightful loveletter to writers.",0
1699,"I laughed hysterically at the locked door + wall busting scene. It was *so* cartoonish & over the top even for a Wes movie that it was like John Henry driving a spike right into my funny bone. Though I have seen her well known earlier work, I was still stunned to see a completely nude Lea Seydoux for a prolonged period of time. Just got back from seeing this and I thought it was absolutely delightful but also quite poignant. I thought Jeffrey Wright brought a great melancholy and loneliness to his character and section and his meditations on being a stranger in an adopted country and feeling as though you're never quite at home in either place was very real and relatable to me. For a film that I've heard people criticize for not being able to connect to the characters over and over again, I didn't have that problem. This was a great return to form after the disappointing Isle of Dogs. ",0
1700,It's also one of Anderson's funnier films! I laughed out loud several times! Adrien Brody kills it comedically in Anderson's films. Owen Wilson gets some good moments too.,0
1701,"Lyna Khoudri (motorcycle helmet girl) really stood out to me. She and Lea Seydoux channel a similar kind of militant attitude that feels reminiscent of the Greta Gerwig character in Isle of Dogs but where that character felt unnecessary in that film, these characters were both funny and forthright and fascinating in equal measure. The wrong film slide scene at the art show got me really good. This movie is like that one scene from Grand Budapest Hotel where they show the secret society of concierges, but it's for an hour and a half. Don't know if that makes sense. I loved the film! 5/5 stars My favorite part of the film was Benecio painting Lea Seydoux, then she steps aside to get dressed into a guard uniform. Quickly throwing a straight jacket on Benecio as she returns him to his cell. ",0
1702,"I laughed so hard at that, it was so unexpected. Plus I loved their relationship, very odd and quirky. I love how they hissed and growled at each other. ",0
1703,"Also Benecio’s explanation for joining basket weaving and pottery was Oscar worthy, what a great monologue, The sound design is incredible in this film. I'm hard-pressed to remember a time where diegetic sound has been noticeably reflexive. During the Manifesto, the walls fall and the music grows. When JKL walks from her podium, her voice loses reverberance. While the film's sounds bring attention to the process, they remain subtle and hold purpose. Very fun.",0
1704,"As in most Anderson films, the visuals obviously showcase his style via symmetrical framing and low depth of field. The transitions from color to black-and-white were not new (i.e. Grand Budapest Hotel, Isle of Dogs), but still rather well used. It seemed he utilized this method around a rule regarding the future and the past melding with these moments. However, the scene with Lt. Nescaffier walking up the staircase used color, and thus seemed jarring. The use of color lacked purpose with no real color to be highlighted with the choice. If it remained black-and-white, the geometry of the frame could have been more fleshed out. Reminded me of the staircase scene in Andrejz Wajda's ""A Generation"".",0
1705,"I think my favorite part of the film was Anderson's decisions to break his style several times throughout the film. Each time was unique to its moment, and held impact amidst the established methods of the director. Simone's asymmetrical profile was beautiful. The handheld shot of Krementz interrupting Zeffirelli and Juliette was dramatic. The taxi cab shared by Zeffirelli's parents felt unlike any sequence he's done before. ",0
1706,"Intensely funny that these new choices seem remarkable, but are not particulary innovative amidst film history as a whole. Kudos to Anderson's long-time cinematographer Robert Yeoman. I believe he deserves just as much credit as Anderson for this film, and the films it succeeds.",0
1707,"I walked away with the same feeling I have every time I see a new Wes Anderson: this is better than the last. While some might argue his style is repetitive (beginning to lack creativity), I can't help but feel he's one of the best filmmakers this century. Very few artists create material that consistently improves, and trumps his/her previous endeavors. ",0
1708,No one can achieve this style quite like Anderson and Yeoman. I deeply admire their desire to perfect it. ,0
1709,Great movie.,0
1710,"I'm not gonna touch on the story/world having the depth of a puddle or the paper-thin characters. But what even was the point of finding Sisu? She didn't do anything, just tagged along with Raya. She got new powers with each gem piece....and then she died and never used them to fight the monsters. Everything is solved by the humans putting the gem back together themselves. ",0
1711,"You can literally remove Sisu from the story and it doesn't change. Call it ""Raya's Journey"" or whatever. Raya travelling alone to collect the gem pieces. I mean she already knew where they were, she didn't even need Sisu to help her locate them.",0
1712,Also I couldn't understand a single thing the big lunky dude was saying he was so mumbly and growly. Story would've worked better as a tv show. Events rush through and there's no build up to most of the emotional climaxes. ,0
1713,Namaari clearly had an arc similar to Zuko from Avatar but it's so rushed it doesn't hit at all. The rest of the cast seems underexplored.,0
1714,Also so much lore and setting that could be explored.,0
1715,"Beautiful movie though. I feel like this movie would have been WAY better of Raya and Naamari had switched roles in the story. If we followed the daughter of Fang who betrayed Heart for the good of her clan, and in doing so broke the world.  She then goes on the quest to find Shishu and save the world. She gets to spend the movie making up for her mistake in a world that doesn't trust her.",0
1716,"The film's message about earning trust by giving it becomes a lot stronger if it's Naamari who sets aside her fear and her need to ""do what's right for my people"" and leaves the stone in Raya's hands. Are you kidding me? Hey kids, you know that person who keeps fucking you over? Yeah give em another shot. Like I 100% get the message as they lay into it pretty thick, but damn how many chances do people get? Y’all I can’t emphasize enough how the “trust” theme irked the living hell out of me. It’s one of those themes that is so overwhelmingly superficial, that it’s actually toxic in practice. And it bugs the bejesus out of me that kids could definitely take the message the wrong way.",0
1717,"No, you do not have to trust people who abuse you. Trust is EARNED, Disney, it’s not freely given. If someone repeatedly hurts you, you are not obligated to trust them “because it’s the right thing to do.” It made me super uncomfortable because that borders on some gaslighting, abusive nonsense. Maybe it’s just because of my life experience (work in law enforcement, survivor myself), but I seriously cringed at that because adults who prey on kids often use that sort of reasoning when grooming victims. It seriously bothered me to see it solidified in a Disney movie. ",0
1718,"Parents, please talk to your kids about what *healthy* trust looks like. Your kids are not obligated to trust someone who hurts them just because it’s “right” or because they want to fix something that’s broken. That’s not trust, that’s the start of toxic codependency and abuse. Overall a really beautiful looking movie and pretty decent. This movie had a lot of potential so i do feel a bit disappointed. IMO doesn't come near frozen or tangled in terms of overall story quality. I also enjoyed Moana is quite a bit more. ",0
1719,**What I liked about the movie:**,0
1720,obviously the animation. it was incredible. ,0
1721,The dragon. Both awwqafina performance and the design grew on me. Didn't think at like any of it based on trailers but it worked.,0
1722,The side characters. Another thing i thought Id hate based on the trailer. I actually really liked the side characters and wish they got more fleshed out. Except for the baby. not a fan of the whole 'baby that can move and think like an adult' but it also wasn't as annoying as I'd thought. ,0
1723,Raya. Loved everything about raya. ,0
1724,The fighting scenes. wish there were more of it. ,0
1725,**My issues with the movie:**,0
1726,tl;dr: Bad writing. fast pacing. poor dialogue. too cheezy and the writers forcing themselves into dumb plot. ,0
1727,"Everything about the beginning. It was soo cheesy, way more than usual. I cringed more than once and i typically don't cringe like that during disney animated movies. Also, I know that it pretty typical of disney to rush through the intrs so we can get to the main story quicker, but this one felt way too forced. Everything happened so quickly and there were too many plot holes for me to ignore. a couple small plot holes are easy to ignore but when there are too many it really takes you out of the movie. Everything to do with the crystal made no sense. If this thing is so important why does it have almost no security. Also its got to be in the most obvious place. How did none of the other tribes realize it was in the big ancient mystical looking building on the top of the mountain? And it has no roof. Not like it mattered since it security was non existent, but anyone could have just done what the chief did and come flying in through the roof. ",0
1728,Next the scene where rayas father turns to stone. There is no reason he couldn't have gone into the river with her. He sits there talking to her for 2 minutes before yeeting her into the river. He could have easily (and it would have been safer for raya) if he held her and jumped into the river with her. I dont understand why he just accepted he needed to turn into stone there except for the fact that the movie needed it to move the plot forward. Also why the fuck didnt all those people on the bridge just jump into the river??  ,0
1729,"Also, I think the movie could have had more exposition about the dragons and the evil cloud things at the start. ",0
1730,"My biggest issue though is probably the pacing of the movie and all the missed potential. Disney created and amazing world here, but we barely got to see any of it. Going to the 5 lands and collecting the crystals should have been an amazing adventure full of world building. But it seriously felt like we got 5 minutes in each land and collecting the crystals was sooo easy. If these crystal parts are so important how has nobody attempted to steal them before raya? would have been incredibly easy for fang to take all of them. This movie would have really worked better as a mini series or even just 30min longer. This story was too big and amazing to be 145min movie and it suffered for it.",0
1731, The side characters where surprisingly good. Flesh them out for christ sake. 2min of backstory is not fleshed out and i will not care for them. add 10+ of character development with worldbuilding and the movie improves. ,0
1732,"My next big issue is fang and namaari at the end. Fang just betrays and backstabs throughout the whole movie but at the end it all somehow ok ? they never made a real attempt to show that they had changed. Even at the end its no namaari that takes the leap of faith, it ray. namaari should have been the first one to turn herself into stone. The moral of the story? backstab everyone and somehow everything will work out for you. ",0
1733,"The scene where Sisu dies is so incredibly frustrating. Again i think this was really bad writing. Its so obvious they didn't want to have any real villain in this movie except for the evil spooky clouds, but the film really suffered so much for it. Its so dumb that the dragon fan girl points her crossbow at a fucking dragon. How does she not realize ""hmm the dragon I've idolized and looked up to my entire life is working with my enemy and they say they want to fix the world.. am i the bad guy here? should i listen to them ? should i not point my fucking crossbow and the fucking dragon and think about pulling the trigger ??"". Susis death was 90% on namaari and 10% on raya. You cant blame raya after the constant betrayals from fang and namaari. She brought the weapon so her plan from the start was to betray them and shoot somebody if she needed to. ",0
1734,Just quick thought of how they could fix it: Raya and namaari meet and then namaari gives the crystal and Susi comes out. all the same up to this point. But then namaaris mother comes out because she was following namaari (after that super obvious firework signal) and takes all the dragon crystals. Namaari didnt know about this and feels betrayed by her mother. Namaari then saves raya and they work together to help Susi. In the end the mother realizes she made a mistake and sacrifices herself to save everyone.,0
1735," Then the writers would have to think of a reason why fang putting the crystals together and having Susi doesnt fix anything. Because according to the movie it should, but then the movie plot would fall apart (again bad writing). I know this is also cheezy but its not as bad as what they gave us.",0
1736,also the WATER dragons not being able to defeat the evil clouds that are weak to WATER makes no sense. make some fog. make it rain. there's no reason the dragons died except that the plot required it. ,0
1737,This is way longer then I thought it'd be. I doubt anyone will read all of it but it was nice to vent about it. Still a decent movie thats worth watching for the visuals. “Sisus death was just as much your fault as it was mine.” ,0
1738,Umm what the fuck no it wasn’t. The girl brought a fucking crossbow to a peaceful meeting with the purpose of stealing the dragon to take the glory for herself. Fuck off with that shit The girl from fang pissed me off so much! What does binturi mean? “Sisus death was just as much your fault as it was mine.”,0
1739,"How?  She was the one who brought a crossbow to what was supposed to be a meeting of making amends. Gorgeously animated, every frame looked so beautiful and the water effects in this movie are                                                                   some of the best ever in a cgi movie. I wish I could see it in theaters and not just on demand Me: yeah I can see where this is going ",0
1740,*Sisu fucking dies* ,0
1741,Me: ...oh,0
1742,"Great movie. Just finished watching it. What really lingers with me is that I don't think the animation has ever been this good in a Disney movie, the colors and art design is just out of this world! Whether you like it or not no one can deny that this movie looked gorgeous. No one pointing out that the ending was a play by play of Guardians of the Galaxy? I really enjoyed the movie though might’ve worked better as a Disney+ limited series so that we could have spent more time in each kingdom. What we got though was pretty great, I especially love the idea that the dragons fly by running on rain. It makes for such a great visual I genuinely don’t know where 3D animation goes from here. I guess we’ve been saying that every year since Toy Story, but the lighting and textures are fucking insane. Regardless of the rest of the movie’s quality, the animation was perfect. Of course Alan Tudyk voiced Tuk Tuk. hahahaha Traveling on the river represents the Mekong River.  ",0
1743,"People in Lao/Thailand call the Mekong River, Mae Nom Kong.  This means mother of waters. You could see how many different countries/cultures rely on the River for survival.  This is a theme in Raya. Am I the only one confused about how Raya is riding on Tuk Tuk?",0
1744,"Tuk Tuk is rolling on the ground, but the saddle isn't rolling with Tuk Tuk. Does Tuk Tuk have a hole bored through them that the saddle has an axel attached to? Is it just positioned perfectly so that the saddle is attached to Tuk Tuk at the perfect center of rotation?",0
1745,"I AM SO CONFUSED. The baby was not as annoying as I thought it would be. Maybe one thing that irked me is when the 5 main dragons are fighting against the dunes(or whatever they were called). Main dragons magic is rain, the dunes hate water! so why didnt he just... man idk [deleted] Man, I loved everything about this movie except the dialogue. I feel like a lot of lines were so rooted in modern day that it won't age so well. If this flick carried itself like Mulan or Hercules (still funny, but has a great sense of time and place), I think it'd be an instant classic. I almost feel it would have been better as a 7-10 episode mega-series.  This may be Disney's largest story yet and 2 hours just felt like they couldn't explore their world that much.  ",0
1746,"Overall it was gorgeous and I did like the premise alot.  Not the best Disney movie but absolutely not bad at all.  Just felt like I wanted more of the world at the end and more time to develop the nations and side characters.  Mostly because Captain Boun is a legend. I personally did not liked the Moral of the Story. There are people in the world who should never be trusted, telling kids that they should trust them for the good is pretty dumb lesson",0
1747,"The scene where he's talking about that hot shot chef's dream of opening a pub and the camera never leaves the chef's face as his soul just dies and leaves his body will be a contender for most memorable moment in a 2021 movie. He Ratatouille'd the dad Amir keeps listening to that audionarration about why classical music is great and will last forever. When we get to his Dad's house, classical music is playing. Amir is trying to emulate his invincible father even though he himself probably doesn't like the music. In the end he finally shuts off the narration and allows himself to mourn his mother in a way his father never would.",0
1748,"Fantastic film. Underrated moment: Robin stealing the bike and then rage screaming at the owner before the owner has a chance to even say, ""Hey, that's my bike!"" and then riding off. I was incredibly impressed with this movie. The way this was executed was just perfect for me. At first you think it's going to be like John Wick or Taken, especially with the descent into the underworld at Edgar's place. But then you find out who Rob really is and it just completely changes everything.",0
1749,"Him using his cooking skills and history to talk to people and break them down was incredible to watch, and the parallels between the loss of Apple to Amir's mom was very well done. Fantastic meditation on loss and grief, cannot recommend this enough. Really enjoyed the movie overall. Could have easily just been standard revenge porn, cause revenge is a satisfying fantasy to watch. But I'm so happy it was so much more than that. Has a lot to say about loss and pursuing happiness.",0
1750,"That said, do have a question and feel like I missed something. What was up with the fighting pit? Some place where we people pay money to hit people and watch people get hit? How did that tie in to Robyn's backstory? I didn't really hear the few lines he talked about it. I'm confused cause he was obviously known for being an amazing chef. I just got lost in how taking hits for money tied into all of that, and it really only played in for the first 1/3 of the movie. “Fuck Seattle.”",0
1751,10/10,0
1752,"I really like how, because we’ve been groomed to think this way, that a violent scene is about to happen and he just handles it with words. Very nice change of pace. I want to see it again soon to soak more of it in. There's an undeniably powerful sub-theme that highlights the different ways in which people handle grief:",0
1753,"1) Rob: he shares with Amir in the diner that he feels as though if he never looked for his pig, she would still be alive in his head. He wishes he could have taken the ""ignorance is bliss"" approach after already experiencing crippling grief from his wife's passing.",0
1754,"2) Amir: He tries to convince himself that his mom is dead, and mentions this to Rob. It's easier for him to think of her in past tense.",0
1755,"3) Amir's Dad: following his self-serving tendencies, he delays his wife's death (to her detriment) in an attempt to presumably delay the grief that would come with it.",0
1756,"One last thought: though I was initially crushed for Rob at the end, I think Amir provides him with enough purpose to make it through, even if that means seeing him once every Thursday. Rob gave Amir some crucial fatherly experiences (e.g. showing him how to cook the meal at his dad's home) and Amir gave Rob care and conversation that he hadn't experienced in years. He's not alone, it's just the start of his third chapter of love.

1769,Beautiful cinematography and definitely a story that will make you ponder the themes for a while. It certainly wasn’t the movie I was expecting based on the trailer but that’s not a bad thing. Without a doubt this is the best movie that I've seen since the theatres reopened.    ,0
1770,"If you haven't seen this yet, go see it!  This director is amazing!    ",0
1771,"And Nicholas Cage is absolutely fantastic.  This is his best performance since Leaving Las Vegas.  I really hope that either Cage or Alex Wolff get nominated for awards!  They deserve it. This isn’t the kind of movie that a lot of people expect it to be, but it’s pretty damn good nonetheless. ",0
1772,"And while this clearly isn’t a comedy, I did have a good chuckle at the “sentimental cooking scene” where Cage is *still* covered in blood lol That'll do, 'Pig'. Man he played the tape at the end and I realized it was going to be a song and eerily felt like it was going to be a Springsteen song. So weird. I'm a huge Bruce fan and ""I'm on fire"" always gets to me. Good cover Is there anyone else but Nic Cage who could pull off this breathtaking meditation on love and loss and also give a deadpan serious reading of the line, *”I don’t fuck my pig.”* I sobbed. Great movie. This was an astoundingly nice little film.  And we need more of this.  More MCU and Antman is fine, but these little weird movies have so much love to give.  ",0
1773,"I did, however, constantly wish he washed his face.  But he DID wash his hands for the “big dinner” I saw it last night. It was a very good movie, but my favorite part was as I was walking out of the theater, I heard the couple in front of me talking. The woman said, ""Man, we shoulda gone to see Space Jam. This was some weird shit."" Saw this in the theater last night and really loved it. One of the best movies I've seen so far this year and I'm hoping to watch it again soon. Nicolas Cage is fantastic. I hope that dude decided to open his pub in the end. Follow your dreams, people. Ok so I just watched this with my partner. During the movie we thought it was a odd but a beautiful story. At the end, or the 'reveal' my partner burst into tears because she felt so sorry for him, she has only ever cried from one other movie, so this was a very rare reaction. When the credits rolled she quietly cried again. Did anyone else have this same reaction? I felt a slight sense of sorrow, but definitely far from tears myself. [deleted] I hope everyone that likes to meme on Nic Cage watches this movie. Dude is an incredible actor. He's probably not going to get an Oscar for this performance but he deserves one. Caught this in Philly earlier today. The fullest i've ever seen the indie theater since Shape of Water. Did the entire film look a bit washed out and too bright to anyone else?",0
1774,"Fantastic acting, fantastic screenwriting. I teared up a few times. As somebody else here said, it leaves a lot unsaid and expects the audience to pay attention to clues and things said in passing to have a full understanding of the situation. I also appreciated how it used comedy- even in grief, sometimes shit is just funny. The film also played with my expectations with dividing it into two parts. There was no three act structure. The second part never ends. There is no chapter for resolution. The first part is when he has his pig and the second part is the rest of his life when she is taken from him. Brooding.",0
1775,I also felt that the film had some good commentary on gentrification and catering to a rich but tasteless audience. ,0
1776,Funny things in the credits: pig is credited about halfway through but does not appear in cast in order of appearance. The dishes served in the film have credits right at the end. Special thanks to Janet Weiss (rocky horror? Lol),0
1777,"Sorrento's avatar looked like a combination of Superman, Fred Flintstone and Human Shrek.  “I'm not crazy about reality, but it's still the only place to get a decent meal.”",0
1778,"― Groucho Marx So I understand that this isn't really a perfect movie. It's a little bit hurried, and the characters and story aren't anything to go nuts over...",0
1779,"But dammit, I've missed this Spielberg for so long. We sort of got it with Tintin, but this is the shamelessly sentimental, adventure loving Spielberg I grew up on, and the one that really made me love film. It's a fucking blast, and I absolutely loved it.",0
1780,"And holy shit, Olivia Cooke needs to be in more movies. She's talented as hell. What was that ship from which Gundam comes out of? I thought it resembled Serenity. I may be super wrong though.  Say what you will about the plot (which I enjoyed), but goddamn can Spielberg direct an action scene. The first challenge race and the final battle were some of the coolest, funnest action sequences I've seen in a long time. Sometimes I forget that Spielberg is the king of the blockbuster for a reason. The moment when everyone in the cinema gasped at the reveal that the quarter is giving Parzival an extra life is seared into my brain. Love it. Can someone please explain to me how everyone figured out where the last challenge was and how they figured out ot was in a video game? I felt like part of the movie just got chopped out and I missed that part Wait so there were cops the whole time?! IOI is literally abducting people and forcing them into camps and the police only show up at the very end?!  The Shining sequence absolutely blew my mind. So incredibly fun to see Spielberg dip into *his* inner fanboy and pay tribute to his former mentor with such a detailed recreation of the Overlook and Room 237. The images were so clear as well! Wonder if they used original footage and restored it or if everything was digitally recreated. Any pg13 film that uses its one ""fuck"" to have a random dude scream ""it's fuckin Chucky!"" Is alright by me. I was ready for a ""You stay. I go"" moment from Iron Giant. Pleasantly surprised they went with the ending of T2! This had some truly staggering scenes, there were times when I couldn't believe what I was witnessing.",0
1781,"That said, it is very hokey in places and has pacing issues and characters just randomly appearing to help the protagonist at just the right moment.",0
1782,"That Shining scene though, Holy fuck and the race sequence and the Mecha godzilla.",0
1783,"Jesus.  Simon Pegg playing an American imitating a British accent gave me a chuckle That fucker played Oddjob in GoldenEye. Did anyone notice the film grain during the shining sequence? I thought that was a really cool little detail Is it me or did the Asian dude have replicant eyes when he was holding Nolan at gunpoint? ""You killed my mom's sister!"" ",0
1784,"You mean Aunt? How the hell do you throw the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch without counting to 3 (5) first?  I think the thing this movie lacked most was the feeling of time. In the book sometimes months or a year would go by in between finding a clue or gaining a key. And in that time a lot of character and relationship building happens, that you just lose in the film. Having Wade tell Artemis he loved her basically their first date was just a little cringey for me. I wanted to see them build their relationship, see him get dumped, see him try to redeem himself within the IOI system and then they finally meet in the real world. Time is what I feel the movie was missing. Did anyone else find it weird how the movie basically skims over the death of Wade’s aunt? I know they weren’t really close, but there’s not even one moment of mourning for the woman who helped raise him. It cuts immediately from “murder of family” to “awkward romance”. Felt like a distracting tonal shift. This whole time...  all I wanted was one asshole shouting ""Leeroy Jenkins"" and then, quickly getting vaporized. “I will choose the form of Gundam!”",0
1785,"Theater goes wild Are you seriously telling me that in four years not one single person decided to just fuck about and drive backwards on that race? Shout out to the one dude which out of EVRYTHING that he could be, he chose to be a fucking skeleton. Did it annoy anyone else that hundreds of citizens in the stacks were defending Wade until the second one man pulls out a pistol?",0
1786,Zhao Tao was excellent in this  but the movie has some major pacing issues in the second act.,0
1787,"It's an already slow movie to begin with, that comes to a screaching halt when she goes  back to her hometown about halfway through after which the whole plot arc basically starts over from scratch.",0
1788,"If you're a hardcore Chinese chinephile it's worth watching, but I wouldnt recommend it otherwise. Oh I thought this was a hot take... I enjoyed this, but there are even better Jia Zhangke movies. Only seen it once though. Zhao Tao is certainly fantastic though. I thought it was about Bruce Campbell and white supremacy. Lol that’s what I meant.",0
1789,So I guess Avengers is doing pretty well huh? As you can probably tell this is one of our most popular threads ever. As some of you may remember for The Last Jedi we discovered that Reddit has a weird problem dealing with threads that have over a hundred thousand comments and we are barreling towards that. Because of that **next Thursday at 7pm PDT there will be a second Infinity War official discussion**. As for now remember to keep suggested sort on and enjoy the discussions. ,0
1790,"**Edit:** [You can see the second thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8gvr6n/official_discussion_avengers_infinity_war/) Holy fuck, Thor has had a bad week. Thor went from the forgotten about Avenger to the funniest and coolest in two movies Hulk too scared to smash. They got a dwarf to play a dwarf that lives on a dwarf star and he dwarfs everyone else “You speak Groot?”",0
1791,"“Yeah, they taught it on Asgard as an elective.” I paid good money to watch Thanos stomp out all my favorite characters and ill be damned if i don't pay to see it again.  Rocket is the last Guardian standing :( and this is the second time he's had to watch Groot die. ",0
1792,I feel for the little rabbit. I love that the Black Order baited out Scarlet Witch so that Corvus Glaive could make an attempt on Vision.,0
1793,Black Widow: Where's your friend?,0
1794,"Glaive: I'm in ur base, killing ur dudes I gotta say, the fact that they simultaneously made dinklage a dwarf and the largest character on screen was pure poetry ""It will kill you Thor.""",0
1795,"""Only if I die.""",0
1796,"""That's... what.. killing you means."" They killed black panther while this man still had his own movie in theaters lmao  Can we take a moment to appreciate that Thanos was a threat and character worthy of a decade of buildup? Superhero films get a lot of flak for weak villains but in Thanos I feel like we got a helluva pay off. He's not as self aggrandizing maniacal as he is in the comics while retaining his casual disregard for other life and awe inspiring power. He made me think of Dr. Doom's ""I am the only way forward, such is my burden"" moments personified and it was fantastic. He's such a compelling self assured monster and I loved that your could re-title the film Thanos Origins and it be accurate. Tony Stark returns home to find a positive pregnancy test on the floor is my wild prediction. Rocket: “I have a lot to lose.”",0
1797,"Rocket: loses everything  Thanos got his sunset. This was his movie. Something I haven’t seen anybody mention is Thanos telling Tony that they’re both “cursed with knowledge,” to which Tony replies “My only curse is you.” What an amazing line - Tony has spent every movie since The Avengers struggling with PTSD and paranoia that there’s a larger threat out there, something they weren’t prepared for, to an unhealthy degree. It’s completely consumed him, and now he finally gets to see the thing he fears the most. The Russos have such a great understanding of these characters. I really like the practice of leaving stuff out of trailers - like Thor's new eye and the amount of Infinity Stones in his gauntlet. In a world where keeping stuff a secret is so hard, this is sneaky af.  ""I told you, you'd die for that""",0

1816,This is the second official discussion to coincide with US release. To see the international thread go here: https://redd.it/679svd Drax explaining why it's better to be ugly because then you know for sure someone likes you was hilarious and almost reasonable.

1817,"Yondu is a god damn Guardian. 300 songs on the Zune oh the possibilities! Thought it was great. The ""do you have tape?"" scene in particular. how is no one talking about teenage angst Groot, it was hilarious Best shot in the film was Yondu's arrow taking out the lights and then taking out the guys. Said it in the other thread too:",0
1818,Yondu's arrow may be the coolest weapon in the MCU. A moment to applaud James Gunn casually placing a brothel with sexbots in a Disney film.  In guardians 1 they performed an experiment: can we get people to care about these obscure characters. ,0
1819,"Guardians 2 they repeat the experiment to make sure it's not a fluke... focusing on Drax, Baby Groot, Mantis, Yondu and Nebula... and still elicit laughter and tears. ",0

1822,"Edit - ""homeworld"" The second I heard Stallone mumbling off-screen, I knew we were in for a good time. They finally answered the question of why Drax never wears a shirt I think Dave Bautista stole the show. He nailed the comedic timing of his lines so well.",0
1823,"But the funniest moment was that severed toe joke with Groot. Holy shit, that had me in stitches. Since no one has mentioned it yet, my favorite joke in the entire movie was how the Sovereign's battle station floor was set up like an 80's video arcade complete with arcade sounds. It wasn't just a visual joke, it was a sound joke. A terrific sound joke. They even had at one point, the cliche of everyone gathering around the one awesome arcade player at the cabinet, cheering him on.  The scene where mantis cried after touching drax was cool. Drax just tough as nails trying to look tough but was really super sad.  When they were skipping through hyperspace en route to Ego (just before Stan Lee's cameo), did we get a glimpse of the planet that Hulk is on in the next Thor?  Can I pet your puppy? Underrated line:",0

Like, not creepy at all He may be your father, boy, but he ain't your daddy. ""He was your father, but he wasn't your daddy""  Peter immediately shooting Ego after the big reveal was simultaneously heartbreaking, awesome and darkly humorous.",0
1825,"Holy shit. Gunn's use of color is absolutely masterful.  Rich and vivid, *just* at the border of cartoonish without ever stepping past that line.",0
1826,I haven't seen that kind of striking use of palette since Technicolor was around.  Brought me right back to that moment in Wizard of Oz when she steps out of the shack into a world of saturation.  Gunn has a true panache for bringing the kid in me and the adult in me both to the fore. TIL: I'm attracted to people with gold skin.,0
1827,Pretty crazy that almost every poster for this movie features a close up of Alita’s face covered in puppy blood. Everyone's right about Alita having more of a relationship with the dog than with the guy.,0
1828,The dog even shows up on all the official movie posters.  Saw it and fucking loved it. I thought they were going to wimp out on the Hugo thing. ,0
1829,"Also, unexpected Jai Courtney  So we going to talk about how creepy it was how Jennifer Connelly is casually killed offscreen, and then we see her (presumably) functioning brain, hands, heart, and eyes in that case?",0
1830,"For being PG-13, this film had some very sudden and dark twists. The above mentioned scene, the guy getting sucked into the crusher, Zapan's face getting sliced off, etc. Too many reviews are saying ""CGI bad, me know. Me know CGI inherently bad."" Am I the only one sick of this bandwagon? The CGI in this movie was phenomenal, and they utilized it appropriately. The narrative was pretty good too, with just enough mystery to keep you watching. I'm definitely looking forward to the sequel.  watched it in IMAX 3D. loved it. I hope it makes enough money to be considered for a sequel. Just wanna point out that Mahershala Ali performed phenomenally during his death scene.  Imagine having to act that your body is dying while also performing like Nova, who won't feel a thing of that, is still using the body to watch and communicate with Alita. ",0
1831,"I felt his character was underutilized for most of the movie, but that scene really did it for me. I just wish Hugo never exist. There is no chemistry between him and Alita. I really appreciate that Alita had different outfits each day/scene. I literally felt my heart stop at the end. I fucking loved this movie. ",0
1832,The beginning is awkward as hell but lord does it shine anyway. ,0
1833,"Fuck your mercy.  Rosa gave an incredible performance  This movie far exceeded my expectations. Sure it wasn't perfect, but I loved the world building, and the main character Alita was extremely likeable and fun to watch.",0
1834,"If you're on the fence about seeing it like I was, just go see it, because it's actually a surprisingly entertaining movie. As someone who's never read the manga, I loved this movie. The eyes weirded me out when I first saw the trailer, but when I went to see it in the cinema, it actually made her look more unique and beautiful.",0
1835,"The love story felt kinda lacking and some parts were so cringy, like that ""I'd give you my heart"" scene. Some people in the cinema actually chuckled at that part.",0
1836,"Other than that, it's pretty awesome. Fight scenes were a spectacle and the lore was very interesting. Pleasently surprised with how this turned out, I really enjoyed it. They did a very good job condensing & streamlining the story in a way that feels natural. Unlike the trailer, the dialogue in the movie actually works pretty well. Briskly paced with fantastic action sequences. Shades of Robocop-esqe dark humor and even a character who seems like someone you would find in a cyberpunk from dusk til dawn barfight. Roza Salazar’s preformance/motion capture is the big stand out to me. She absolutely crushed it in my opinion. Feels like it’s gonna end up being a cult hit. I sincerely hope we get a sequel, especially knowing where the story is headed. I’d love to see who they might cast for Figure Four. The character design for Cyborgs/Androids or whatever they're called was fucking top notch.   So we all agree that pretty boy was the weakest character in the movie right?",0

1847,Somethings to keep in mind...,0
1848,* Japanese stories are often paced for [four Acts](https://www.katekrake.com/forwriters/kishotenketsu-the-four-act-narrative-or-the-plot-without-conflict/) instead of three.  ,0
1849,* The movie is based on the first four volumes of the manga and they like the film are a prologue. The central conflict doesn't even start until Volume six. Before that the story was about Alita's daily life and was very much a small town hero tale.,0
1850,***,0
1851,Even if they had gone by the book.,0
1852,"This part of the story was always going to be ""YA"", because it was about a young adult growing up.",0
1853,"All the ""deep"", ""dark"","" rich"", ""existential"", cyberpunk themes and serious adult drama.",0
1854,"Didn't start coming in, until volume six.",0
1855,"Before that Alita in American terms would be a YA, albeit a dark and very violent one.",0
1856,***,0
1857,"If Jim Cameron had started at six volume with Alita as an [Agent of Zalem](#spoiler) roving the wastelands carrying out her duties, until she gets on [Nova's trail](#spoiler).",0
1858,It probably would have better received by the masses. ,0
1859,"But that hypothetical film would have needed flash basks and exposition-dumps to explain how and where Alita came from, and how she got into her current situation.",0
1860,"My only hope is that it does well enough internationally to warrant a sequel.   For better or worse, we have finally achieved anime and manga in live action film. What a weird ass movie, but what a movie that just WENT FOR IT.  I thought it was a pretty unique mix of cheese, cool, and sudden ultra violence.  I liked it.  I liked how Alita was an assertive warrior while still being feminine.  I would have preferred a real present villain instead of a bunch of disposable assholes, but I'm a villain guy. Saw this during their fan event on Monday...thought it looked incredible in Dolby 3D. The action sequences were fantastic.  I liked how it jumped right into from the beginning. My favorite sequence is probably the fight with Grewishka where Alita stabs her arm into his eye and utters the one allowance of Fuck.  The motorball sequences were visually stunning and great but they seemed ultimately unnecessary, if only to set up the whole Winner goes to Zalem plot.  I do hope it does well, I'm interested in the seeds they've planted for future films.  Rosa Salazar really embodies Alita very well. I'm impressed.",0
1861,"If someone told me to spoil the movie for them or they’d kill me, I’d be fucking dead. That double building explosion made my brain wrinkle. Tenet is what it's like to amplify all the good parts of a Nolan film as well as all the bad parts of a Nolan film If there’s one thing Nolan nails, it’s openings. That shit was awesome. Also it was a very loud movie and the explosions going backwards was so rad. Chris Nolan really made a 2-hour+ appeal for watching films with subtitles on Maybe this film want you to watch it with the temporal pincer movement's aspect.",0
1862,You watch it first time as a red team. You go there and have no clue about anything.,0
1863,"Then, you watch it for a second time as a blue team. In which, you mostly know what already happened. There was a lot more sunscreen in this film then I expected. Like it’s crazy how much of the finale is sunscreen related. Okay so who the hell were they fighting at the end? Christopher Nolan: Ok so no blood in a PG-13 movie?",0
1864,Ratings board: No blood.,0
1865,Christopher Nolan: Ok what about somebody plinko-ing on every railing of a boat breaking every bone in their body? ,0
1866,Ratings Board: Ok :)  Never thought I’d see a movie in which the time travel sequences were easy to understand while the regular talking scenes were impossible to follow. Check out the [Sator Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sator_Square). All the words are used in the movie. Ludwig went OFF on that score. Pretty unique sound. Highly recommend listening to the soundtrack on its own.,0
1867,Maybe Nolan was too in love with the soundtrack that he put it in the forefront. The movie was more interesting than it was good.,0
1868,"The inverted time stuff was cool and the scenes showing it off were awesome. But the plot around it was uninteresting and kinda generic, which was a huge disappointment.",0
1869,"The acting was good. Denzel's son, Pattinson and the tall blonde(Debecki?) did well.",0
1870,The writing was pretty questionable. Some bizarre clunky lines.,0
1871,They didn't want to commit to a romantic relationship or spend time explaining or developing a close bond/friendship between Washington's and Debecki's characters. So it felt bizarre that he suddenly was so committed to protecting her.,0
1872,The final climatic scenes were confusing and hard to follow.,0
1873,"Slightly disappointing, though I didn't come in with high expectations. Not one of Nolan's stronger films. 7/10 and that might be generous. Could have been a lot better than it turned out to be. The only emotional impact I felt was ""Oh no, not the cello"" So I think every other comment here is gonna be about the sound but I just really appreciate how Kat was like, a foot taller than everyone else in the movie and they made no attempt to hide it. Said this in the other thread, but even a full day later I'm still not sure if this film is a 3/10, 5/10, or 8/10. There's like half a character in this movie I'm writing a full review of the film now but after quickly looking through this comment thread, this film has real potential for some Rick and Morty level fandom gatekeeping for understanding it. I do feel like I understood the film, but the blasted out audio on most of the exposition scenes (combined with the fact that so much dialogue took place in loud settings, underneath gas masks, or with heavy accents) is easily enough to warrant not understanding the film. -scrolls furiously through comments to understand movie I just paid full attention to- Imma keep it real with y'all: I have no clue what the whole deal with the painting was about. i loved the use of time for the fights.  airport fight first starts off with him at a disadvantage and slowly gaining an advantage because the inverse starts off at a disadvantage but understands hes done this already so gains the advantage My biggest question:",0
1874,"Why were all these goons helping Sator end the world.  His desire to end it all was purely selfish: if I can’t have it, no one can.  So what was in it for his army of goons?  Why would they willingly help him end all life on earth? Would an inversed fridge remain cold when unplugged? I’m gonna be honest, I don’t think hearing all the dialogue would have helped me understand it any better.",0
1875,This was Inherent Vice levels of “am I even supposed to understand this?” Nolan is literally the Hideo Kojima of movies at this point. Visionary and ambitious.. but gets his head up his ass and sometimes needs others to reel him in when he goes too far.,0
1876,"Anyone think it was intentional that he was freed by picking cotton? The scene where he meets everyone at the party. Their conversation with him were them vetting him to see if he was what they wanted like the white guy and his golf game or Eastern European lady asking about the sex and the winning bidder wanting Chris for his photographer's eye. Peele really hit a grand slam with this. ""Man, I told you not to go in that house.""",1
1877,"This film had one of the best audience reactions I've experienced, without annoying me at all. I feel like the film wanted to take the audience on a ride and wanted you to do what a classic horror film does. Interact and just have a fun ass time. ",1
1878,"I can't wait to see what Peele does next! He solidified his writing/directing chops with me the second those end credits hit. Most unrealistic part of the movie was that everyone used Windows phones.  Redbone was perfect for the opening of the movie.  So I take it the skinny black guy at the party wore that hat to cover up any scars from his brain transplant? Also, the groundskeeper wore hats as well, if I remember correctly. Are we all forgetting that Andre is still a sex slave? Did anyone else catch his reaction upon seeing the teacup video when he put the cotton in his ears? I thought this was a nice, subtle hint to the viewer.",1
1879,"Whenever he's been hypnotized by the teacup up to that point, his physical body gets locked into a trance. This time, he goes limp. It's because he knows the teacup takes him out of the world, but doesn't know what his outward physical reaction is. He just assumes it's passing out. He's faking the hypnosis and putting on a show for whoever might be watching, but it's not correct. Luckily, no one is around to catch it. My husband brought up an interesting point that I didn't see here. ",1
1880,"When all the guests arrive, the groundskeeper and Georgina greet them out of their cars. Rarely would a housekeeper greet guests but because they are the grandparents and it is THEIR party, they were greeting.  ",1
1881,EDIT: Photo Evidence - look how happy she is to see him! http://m.imgur.com/a/Beyhm What I love about this movie is that when you break down the premise of the movie it's almost like a comedy skit turned into a horror film. White people taking control of black people's bodies is a skit I could totally see on Key and Peele   ,1
1882,"Initially when I saw the trailer it looked like a real departure for Jordan Peele to do, but watching the movie it just made perfect sense that he would write this. Really loved this film and I hope it succeeds at the box office  Does anyone else think that Rose's family was so insistent that Chris stop smoking cigs because cigs do a lot of damage to the human body (which is what he was later auctioned off as)? Rod= MVP.",1
1883,"That is all. Anyone else's theater burst into applause when the car door opened and it read ""Airport""? I don't know if it's been mentioned, but I found it fascinating how the girlfriend died bleeding out on a cold road. It's funny that Chris described this as being his mother's death some odd hours ago.  I dead honest they were going to go a step further and say Obama was actually a white guy. Her dad saying he would have voted for him for a third term. It would have been great if this conspiracy went ALL THE WAY to the top. Just noticed that when the dad (Dean) said ""We hired Georgina and Walter to care for my parents, and when they died I couldn't bear to let them go"" he meant his parents and not Georgina and Walter. Love the subtle bits of dialogue in this movie. This movie is worth seeing in the theater for audience reactions alone.",1
1884,"The writing had so many subtle hints. Like, when Rose mentions in passing that the basement is sealed due to ""black mold."" In the basement, black people's bodies are used as molds (a hollow shell) for white people to use.",1
1885,"Edit: it was the dad, not Rose Chris's rampage towards the end of the movie was one of the most satisfyingly badass moments I've seen in a *long* time.",1
1886,"Every other part of the movie was great too. Really appreciated how it defies a lot of common horror tropes, and how almost every element is tied back in at a later point. Okay but why are we not talking about how creepy it was when Chris went upstairs and everyone just stopped talking.  Did anyone else's heart drop when Chris' voice kinda cracked begging Rose for the keys? Pure dread right there. I sure hope Chelsea Peretti's family knows how to take a joke!  I turned to my husband after Georgina said ""tattletale"" and said they are Skeleton Key-ing their asses.",1
1887,I loved how they played with the tension of it being actually threatening versus being awkward versus him thinking it was something and it wasn't. ,1
1888,The scene where he finds the picture box was chilling since that really clinched that she was in on it the whole time. ,1
1889,The only part I would have changed was if his friend had Sid the dog in the back seat of his TSA car. ,1
1890,"Edit: fixed her name (it's Georgina says IMDB). Anyone else like how in the beginning Rose said that her dad won't chase Chris out of the house with a shotgun but at the end she did.  Something I thought was really interesting was when Rose back-talked the cop about Chris giving him his ID she wasn't really doing it out to stand up for him, she was trying to keep a paper trail of them being together and on the way to her parents. ",1
1891,"This movie was so great.  Guys, it stands at 127 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes with a 100% score. Impressive stuff.  ",1
1892,"EDIT: the first and only person to give it a rotten review is Armond White of the National Review. It stands at 143 reviews, 99% score.",1
1893,That whole movie was a trip.... but the Bennie and the Jets number was on a whole different level. I LOVED THIS SO MUCH!,0
1894,Taron Egerton is amazing as Elton John.  His singing is incredible.  The film isn't afraid to show the darker parts of Elton's life.  The song performances are fantastical and dreamlike. ,0
1895,It's everything I wanted Bohemian Rhapsody to be. I think what separates Rocketman from Bohemian Rhapsody is that Elton is still here to tell his story. ,0
1896,"I loved how authentic it felt, how Elton was not the hero the whole story and he was incredibly honest about his life. He said before the movie premiered that he wouldn’t tone down the sex and drugs and I think the film would have suffered greatly if it had. The drugs were not glorified and they were not shown in a positive life. ",0
1897,"Overall, I rated this my top movie of the year and I hope it wins all the awards next year. 9.5/10 ""He still has a problem with shopping"" might be the best freeze-frame/""where are they now"" text in any biopic ever I wonder what John Reid was like in real life. In both this and bohemian rhapsody he is just a super douche. Anyone else impressed by how meaningful and relevant to people’s lives the messages they tried to convey in this movie were? It was actually a good film about mental health and self-examination. I think people can relate to Elton a lot and I hope it convinces some to seek therapy, I like how it showed it was one of the best things to ever happen to him. “Guy next to me wouldn’t stop crying” ",0
1898,- girl next to me during whole Elton John movie What a pleasant surprise when Jamie Bell belted out ‘Goodbye Yellow Brick Road’. Astonishing sequence and so thematically rich.,0
1899,"Fletcher and Egerton did some amazing work in following the biographical structure but adding so much whimsy and darkness through those musical sequences. Everyone will likely talk about the ""Crocodile Rock"" scene but the ""Your Song"" scene was beautiful asf. Favorite Elton song. I get the feeling the approach this film takes is something you're either on board with, or you're not.  ",0
1900,"I absolutely loved it. Not really an Elton John fan (don't get me wrong, like the songs I've heard just never listened to that much) but I was absolutely on board for the ride. It gave a jolt in the arm to the tired music-biopic format. The fantasy elements were used to great effect. Take the scene where everyone levitates during his first performance. It shows the effect he had much more than just a straight song performance could. It really helped to show us who Elton is, more than just re-enactments of things he did.  ",0
1901,"To repeat everyone else, Taron is fantastic. Really helps to let the actor actually sing rather than mime, it frees him up so much. Jamie Bell is as great as ever. Richard Madden, Bryce Dallas Howard, Steven Graham. Loved the cast.  ",0
1902,"It does however further denigrate Bohemian Rhapsody in my eyes. Can you even imagine how amazing a Queen film would've been if they'd had the balls (figurative and literal) that this film had? If they just went for it, rather than having band members accidentally come up with classic songs that Rami Malek then mimes. The extremes this film goes to only serves to further show how safe Bo Rhap played it. It's such a wasted opportunity.  ",0
1903,"But blessed are we, for Rocketman was not such a waste. Do yourself a favour. And try not to get out of your seat and start dancing during the Saturday Night's Alright scene. Egerton...wow. Dude totally killed it. Sure as shit didn’t think he had something like that in him. Movies that end too soon.",0
1904,"Wow, I loved the movie. I could have happiely watched another 2 hours.",0
1905,"I would have loved to see more. The love story with his partner, the Lion King, Princes Di. So much more story to tell. ",0
1906,"Campy fun, heartfelt storytelling: More please! I'm not gay but damn do I like Richard Madden's accent Taron was really good in this. And what a great pick: there were a few shots when he was in full stage costume where I could have sworn they snuck the real Elton in. [deleted] I liked how every time we cut back to the support group, Elton had another piece of his outfit removed until he was normally dressed like everyone else in there. Thought that was a neat touch. The fact that his big showdown with the people who caused him pain in life was him facing them down as figments of his imagination was surprisingly moving, and I think it better reflects the real man than if he went and talked to all of the people in person. The moment where he hugged his younger self was quick but incredibly effective. The big resolution wasn’t him showing his demons who was boss, but learning to love himself. It was incredibly moving. Just about every person near me in the theatre was crying, including myself. I heard constant rumbling in the background throughout the movie and I couldn’t tell if it was from the thunderstorm outside or Godzilla in the IMAX theater down the hall I was kind of waiting for the movie to really start for a while, but as soon as the “Saturday Night” scene started, holy shit I was hooked. This 100% becomes a Broadway musical. And I'll be first in line to see it. The scene where his boyhood version asks Elton ""when are you going to hug me?"" was honestly one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen. Liked the movie but loved this. ",0
1907,"So many people in life could benefit from embracing the hardships of their childhood and showing themselves love. It spoke to me. One of my favorite parts of this movie was how ""gay-positive"" it was. Bohemian Rhapsody really didn't portray Freddie's sexuality in a great light: his first encounter with a man is in a seedy truck stop, his hetero love interest was his final saving grace, etc. It really made it seem like everything bad in Freddie_s life was due to his being gay. ",0
1908,"Rocketman really shows it differently. The sex scenes aren't shown as morally corrupt, but rather the same as any sexual relationship anyone has. His issues come from his decadent and self-destructive lifestyle, and his sexuality isn't the root cause of that. Strange how Taron Egerton has covered ""I'm Still Standing"" 2 times for 2 different movies This movie. THIS FUCKING MOVIE. ",0
1909,"It was perfect. I know is not a perfect movie, but with my bias I’m gonna give it a perfect 10/10. This is how you do a jukebox musical. Some highlights:",0
1910,"1. Rocketman, man this number was awesome. I love the transition from the pool to the hospital to the baseball outfit. Easily one of the best performance of the movie.",0
1911,"2. When Elton is practicing his smile and then goes out and starts playing the piano, and the scene is just spinning. I love how the mark his downward spiral. Perfectly done. ",0
1912,"3. When young Elton started signing Saturday Night’s Alright (for fighting). At first I thought, “man, they must be crazy to waste this song like this” but soon enough Taron Elton appeared and it was so well done. ",0
1913,"4. When Sorry seems to be the hardest word stars palming in the background in that breakfast with his wife, and then continues through the dinner with his mom and Bernie. ",0
1914,"5. Like how he started rehab with the devil’s outfit, and little by little Elton gets undressed to, show us the passage of time, and that he’s becoming more vulnerable. ",0
1915,"6. Speaking of rehab. I like how the final confrontation with all of his demons were done in front of the other people in rehab, and they didn’t fade to the background just leaving Elton and the people he needed to confront. It probably wasn’t the intention of the scene, but I took it as his life not being really private, he is a public figure, after all. I said this in the advanced screening thread and I need to say it again. I feel the biggest reason I liked this movie was that they never showed drugs and alcohol wasn’t cool about it. You saw him struggling and the part that hit me the most was when he was having breakfast and he fills half his cup with vodka and the rest with oj and you see the look on his wife’s face and it really feels like he know his life is a mess. It really showed with what he has has been fighting for and his causes. I feel he was really trying to let people know not to end up like him and get help. I also loved the end where they ended with I’m still standing it was perfect.",0
1916,"Wouldn’t it be nice to spend a whole summer reading books and listening to music in your underwear? I’m jealous. Has anyone here actually stuck their thing into a peach/apricot before? Is that actually a thing teenagers did/do and I just missed the memo at the time? I absolutely love this one, however I was deeply offended when Timothée, without a single care, allowed the juices from the peach to drip onto the bed sheets. I mean, good heavens, that was wrong. “To feel nothing so as not to feel anything, what a waste”. Damn. That quote is gonna stay with me a while Armie Hammer needs to make more movies where he dances. There were many scenes in this movie that stuck with me, most of which have probably been discussed to death here (the dad, the peach, the sheer pleasure of sitting around reading, swimming, and doing whatever you want unsupervised).",1
1917,"I think as an American, one of the things that stuck to my bones was how the parents reacted to their son's sexuality. I don't mean his homosexuality. I mean, sexuality as a whole. Despite most of the key characters being American, they all have a European sensibility that it very rare to see here in the US. One could argue that the movie itself could be making a social comment about open, honest European views of sex vs. moralizing, restrictive American views.",1
1918,"First, the parents see their son is attracted to a man, so they do things to help facilitate that attraction by giving them the idea to travel alone together. They also let Elio and Oliver have their space in the house - they aren't monitoring Elio or ""checking up on him,"" which I found refreshing.",1
1919,"Second, the parents are genuinely always there for Elio in helping him discuss sexual relationships. He is able to say to his parents out loud, ""I could never be that open,"" a vulnerable statement I have trouble imagining expressing to my parents. They simply reassure him; they don't nag or moralize him about sex. Of course, there's the scene with the father discussing his own sexual past and desires, openly and without judgment that exemplifies this behavior.",1
1920,"Third, the adults in the movie treat Elio respectfully with regards to his sexual encounters. For example, when Elio greets the older gay couple with Marzia and quickly gives her a kiss and loving pat, the adults simply maturely greet her and say hello. No one says ""Ohhhhhhh! You have a GIRRRLFRIENND!!!!!!!!!"" In the US, I find it typical that adults make teasing comments and condescending ""jokes"" about ""how cute it is to have a crush"" to teenagers. This moralizing can make teens internalize that they are doing something wrong, when they are actually doing something natural.",1
1921,"To see adults treat Elio respectfully and collegially, like a mature young adult for whom sex is one of many natural, positive experiences, filled me with hope, jealousy, and a strong feeling about the kind of parent I'd like to be if/when I have teenagers. It's not very common you walk out of a movie thinking, ""This movie has changed or informed the way I want to live my life"" but this one has for me.",1
1922,"Last, I think we are in a particular time where we are really looking back on the 1980s with a specific nostalgia for a time when kids could just be kids, ride their bikes everywhere, have adventures, be home for dinner, then go out again and have more unsupervised adventures. Stranger Things, It, and CMBYN all are really tapping in to that nostalgia, albeit in slightly different ways. That brief 4th wall break at the end of Visions of Gideon... it just hit something very emotionally raw in me. The monologue from Michael Stuhlbarg is probably my favourite scene in any movie this year. I think about it a lot. It affected me so much I had to call my dad after to talk. While I thought Elio and Oliver make the perfect couple, I did feel bad for Marzia. The moment Elio gets Oliver he completely forgets about her and when she confronts him about it, he's like ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  Fun Fact: Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet stayed and bonded on location a month before the actual filming. They got ample time to know each other very well and spend time with each other doing most of what happened in the movie too. ",1
1923,And they admittedly said that this is the primary reason why their on-screen chemistry really worked and felt so genuine.,1
1924,"In my opinion, their on-screen chemistry is one of the best and most authentic I’ve ever seen. You can really feel their intimacy especially during the sensual scenes. And that’s why them parting really affected me deeply.  This is one of the most **A E S T H E T I C** movies I've seen.",1
1925,"Not just in the sense that it's sensually arresting and just beautiful to look at but that all the Greek sculptures and 80s setting reminds me of Macintosh Plus. that final shot is going to stay with me for a very long time  My favourite scene is when Elio is sitting at the station trying not to cry. A lot of Timothee's performance comes from trying not to show his emotions, that's what makes it so great. Was Elio joking when he asked Oliver on the phone if he's getting married? ",1
1926," Like Oliver says ""I've got good News"" and Elio says ""What, you're getting married?"". I took that to believe Elio was looking for an answer like... ""I'm coming back next summer"". Anyone else?  This may fall on deaf ears but I thought the costume design was great.  Did anyone else feel like the story kept baiting and switching typical romance/gay tropes.",1
1927,"I thought the notebook Elio left on the bed would get discovered, it didn’t.",1
1928,I thought maybe Oliver and Elio’s papers would get mixed up in the backpack but they didn’t.,1
1929,I thought they would get caught having sex but they didn’t.,1
1930,Maybe this last one is a stretch but I kinda expected that call at the end to be about AIDS but it wasn’t (I’m blaming that on watching Dallas Buyers Club a couple days prior). Sorry Cum Peach... Cum Turkey Baster still has you beat in the cum isn't supposed to go in there Award.,1
1931,Also... My favorite piece of CMBYN trivia,1
1932,"> Regarding the peach scene, Luca Guadagnino went to Timothée Chalamet and told him that he had tried it out himself and it was in deed possible to do, so therefore he thought they should do the scene. Chalamet responded by saying he had also tried it and agreed to do the scene.",1
1933," I loved all of the random side characters and scenes (like the fish scene). Such a great way to establish the environment more fully. Beautiful movie Sufjan is one of my favorites artist and seeing his music fit so well with it’s heartbreaking scenes  “Not a straight body in these statues, they’re all gay.” My pick for best movie of 2017. ",1
1934,"I just loved the whole atmosphere of this film, from the music to the pacing to the naturalistic acting. I think it was refreshing to see an LGBT romance that was allowed to be just that, a romance, without focusing on any sort of overt obstacle like violent aggressors, disapproving parents, AIDS, etc. (Although I would understand if people think that makes the film disingenuous). ",1
1935,"Everyone always talks about Timothee's last scene, and deservedly so, but I was super impressed with his physical acting throughout the whole film, as he clearly has some strong instincts as an actor that are rare for someone his age.  Can we please talk about the flies? Those weren't coincidental. Anyone have any take away from them?",1
1936,My biggest was the way in which they represented us the audience. I truly felt like a fly on the wall just observing someone's experience similarly to how I did when I saw Boyhood. I was almost uncomfortable during the sex scenes because it felt like something I shouldn't be seeing because it's their moment and they should be able to have it without spectators. Just got out of this movie. It was...devastatingly beautiful. It’s a movie that I’ll be thinking about for a while. ,1
1937,"I’m a bisexual Indian-American guy who didn’t grow up in the cultured natural paradise that Elio lives in, or with parents as open-minded as his are. What’s more, I haven’t ever felt ~~true love~~ powerful, intense, passionate obsessive infatuation like Elio did. His experience should have felt totally alien to me. Yet, I felt his infatuation, frustration, passion, heartbreak as if they were my own. Chalamet did a phenomenal job. ",1
1938,"The cinematography was great. The languid and lingering shots, and even the abrupt jumps, made it feel like a long yet fleeting summer. ",1
1939,"The father’s monologue at the end nearly had me in tears, especially when he told Elio not to suppress his sadness. And that credit sequence...oh man.",1
1940,"There were parts that fell a bit flat for me. The pacing was a bit off at times, and the romance did seem a bit rushed initially. However, overall, I am very happy I saw this movie, and have a feeling I’ll revisit it time and again. I could watch Michael Stuhlbarg read an encyclopedia. ",1
1941,"Easily my favorite film of the year.  As a gay man, I had a very hard time watching this movie the first time through. The ""moment of discovery"" is so ubiquitous in gay romances like this, that I spent the whole film anxious waiting for the shoe to drop. I went back and watched it again with the knowledge that it never does and enjoyed the film even more the second time.",1
1942,"It truly is one of the greatest ""first love""  movies I've ever seen. The phone call at the end was the standout for me. Timothy Chalamet deserves an oscar nod for that scene alone. You can physically see all his feelings slamming into him. It's a truly outstanding showcase of subtle physicality. He's officially added to my list of must-watch actors. Well, I've been sitting on this for about a month and having seen the movie twice now I can say it's one of my favorite movies of all time. I was excited for this movie for a while, but still didn't expect to be completely floored by the entire thing.",1
1943,"This movie is a masterpiece and the best portrayal of firsts (sex, love, heartbreak) I have ever seen. Everything in the movie felt so real, it truly brings you back to your first love. It makes you feel the wave of emotions that you felt the first time you fell in love.",1
1944,"Timothee Chalamet gives an absolutely mesmerizing performance in this movie. I can't begin to express how talented he is. He completely encompasses Elio. Honestly the first time around I barely even took note of the other amazing performances here because my eyes were glued to Timothee the whole time. Armie Hammer is fantastic as well, I was able to relate to him and his role in the situation. He is very conflicted, sometimes warm, sometimes cold. And Michael Stuhlbarg is great as well, he has such a presence on screen.",1
1945,"The music in this movie is what I can only describe as beautiful, Sufjans songs in particular stand out as incredibly moving. Visions of Gideon is an absolute soul crusher. The music added to the atmosphere of the movie, which was so warm and peaceful. It was so refreshing to see a movie about two men in a relationship that didnt end with one of them dying or angry parents, nothing of the sort. Time is the villain here, and I think that makes it all the more tragic.",1
1946,"I will say while I love the movie, it didn't have the profound effect it did on me until the scene with Mr. Perlman near the end. I'm not someone who is easily affected by movies and shows but that monologue destroyed me. It's a universal message to anyone feeling pain and on a more personal note something I needed to hear. I had been pushing away and trying to just forget certain things in my life but after seeing this movie I felt a whirlwind of emotions that led me to finally being able to be happy about past relationships rather than bitter. I guess you could say this movie changed my life and how I view relationships going forward.",1
1947,"Overall, Call Me By Your Name is a deeply moving film about love with a fantastic performances, amazing atmosphere, and a few scenes that will stick with you (the monologue, Elio by the fire). I can't recommend it enough.",1
1948,"Was absolutely in love with the lighting in this movie and even the reflections, added so much life to all of it. 22 was literally the 22nd soul in existence, correct? I heard the Jerry's refer to othe baby souls in the billions. [deleted] Seeing Abraham Lincoln getting irrationally angry at Andrew Jackson for being on the 20 dollar bill is something I never thought I wanted to see. if anyone lives in nyc.... this movie was unbelievably touching in its attention to detail. the subway trains, the fences around the little gardens on the sidewalk, the streets, the buildings. even the blue note reference. it was pretty emotional seeing my city bursting with life, especially during these trying times. I loved the contrast between the first time they show all the mundane things Joe does and he says ‘my life was meaningless’ and then the ending montage shows him finding joy in all of those mundane moments. The middle school band playing the When You Wish Upon a Star theme to the Disney Castle intro killed me. ",0
1949,Also the cutaway to the cat’s soul on the conveyor belt was hilarious Since 22 is on Earth now that means she can’t fuck with the Knicks anymore right? Knicks winning in 2021 lets gooooooo The animation was next level. I love the choices they made for the abstract characters. That aerial shot of NYC with Central Park is one of most incredible frames ever imo. To just live is enough. Such a great message. Life being full of ups and downs is OK. The journey is better than the destination. Live in the now. I dig it.,0
1950,Tears were had.,0
1951,"Plus it had a cat falling face flat onto the floor. So this man really performed a whole Jazz concert with an open lollipop, a pizza crust, and a half eaten bagel in his pocket. Can’t believe pizza rat made a cameo I see a lot of people crying foul with how abruptly it ends. I felt that the ending was designed to be ambiguous. ",0
1952,It's not about what career path that Joe chooses.,0
1953,"It's about the fact that *whatever* career he chooses, he'll be living life to its fullest.",0
1954,"He starts off as a man unable to walk down the street without getting killed because of his massive tunnel-vision, and he ends as a man who has learned to embrace the present.",0
1955,I dug that they went with an ambiguous ending. Many other animated films would have spelled things out for the audience.,0
1956,This one trusts the viewer.,0
1957,Edit- The filmmakers actually cited multiple different endings that they tried. Here's a link:,0
1958,"https://wdwnt.com/2020/12/pixar-considered-several-different-endings-for-soul/ On a side note, that bug-zap sound effect when souls entered the Great Beyond was absolutely fucking horrifying. 22's lost soul inner dialogue was a whole mood and I identified a little TOO well with those voices in her head. I'm genuinely interested to see if kids like this movie. I can usually separate the two in Pixar movies where there's the kid's movie and the parts for grown-ups sewn into it. This feels distinctly the opposite - there's the cat/guy buddy movie, sure, but it really mainly feels like a movie for adults with kid stuff thrown in",0
1959,"Edit: I LOVED the movie, and I think it's an interesting move for Pixar, potentially starting a push toward making mainstream animation for older audiences - I wish this was in theaters (not just because it's gorgeous to watch) so that we could see how it did monetarily compared to others. It's almost like something Laika would do, but Pixar At the end of the credits you Terry comes out and yells “the movies over! Go home!” Even though everybody is home I just want to give a shout out to Terry.  Just an unappreciated cosmic accountant trying to do their job the best they can. The scene toward the end of Joe remembering seemingly insignificant yet beautiful moments of everyday life was the highlight for me. Really thought he'd realize his spark would be teaching. Good overall. This movie's portrayal of jazz is astounding. The call and responses between Joe and Dorothea in their first song, to the blues of the next, to the swing of the next, just took everything about the genre that I adored.",0
1960,"Connie going to Joe (really 22) to tell him how much she hates band, followed by her saying how much it sucks, playing a minute-long solo, and then deciding to stick with it, with 22-Joe just saying ""hey you're really good at that"" was such a teenager thing to do. Loved that moment especially.",0
1961,"When they showed Joe playing in front of his father, with him just nodding to the music with his eyes closed, I was practically bawling. It was just the silent approval of Joe's calling that his father seemed to notice struck all kinds of nerves.",0
1962,"10/10. Amazing in all aspects. ""Hands are hard!""",0
1963,"I'm sure they are, considering how insanely impressive the hand movements in this movie are during the musical instrument scenes. ",0
1964,Cute inside joke!,0
1965,"Also, **Pizza Planet Truck** is in the Hall of Everything. Still can’t get over how gorgeous it looked, I swear NYC looked photorealistic at times. It's all clear now why the Knicks suck so bad The message of ‘your spark isn’t your purpose in life, it’s what makes you want to live’ was one that hit me right in the existential gut. The knicks joke was hilarious. ",0
1966,"But also man what a movie, the Jerry’s were hilarious. Pretty sure one of them was a headspace guy. Very deep movie, well made and a great combination of entertainment and depth",0
1967,Heads up there's some new features on YouPoll!,0
1968,Now anyone can use the Chart or Filter link in the upper corners of the applicable poll or list. With filter you can add all kind of deviations and other nerdy stats to see how the overall ranking lists play out.,0
1969,With charts on individual polls you can now see all kind of different graphs for the breakdown of scores. Even cooler there's now an animation feature which lets you see how the poll changes over time. I think one of the most interesting one to try is The Last Jedi which you can try here: [https://youpoll.me/3751/r](https://youpoll.me/3751/r) The Grinch realizing he ate of his food from emotional eating and has to go grocery shopping while trying to avoid people was too relatable I need Keenan Thompson to do more voice acting. ,0
1970,"“I think I saw Santa! What’s in this cake? I need to get another piece!” I half expected the Grinch to become Cindy Lou’s step dad at the end. Would have made for an interesting ending That stupid goat screaming made me laugh like an idiot Weird seeing ppl say Jim Carrey grinch was horrible...that movie was fuckin hilarious..IM AN IDIOT!....YOUR AN IDIOT!

2003,"If I had to rate it, I'd give it 8 out of 10. I love Cumberbatch but he isn't exactly the guy I'd peg to voice The Grinch...felt a little dull through most of the runtime. But, the rest of the voicework is great, and Kenan Thompson, you need to do animation more! ",0
2004,"Fine, but surprisingly long for 84 minutes. Sure most kids and families will like it enough, least those in my theater did. At least it isn't The Nutcracker and the Four Realms.  That was so much better than I expected. Glad they didn't turn the Whos of Whoville into materialistic jerks like the live-action movie did. I thought it was a fresh take on The Grinch story. The overall storyline was pretty original outside of the third act. ",0
2005,"If you're a Grinch fan I would recommend it, mostly because it isn't what you expect it to be but it still delivers. It's not a remake or a copy.   I am a very big fan of the Grinch both the original and the Jim Carrey version and if your expecting those qualities in the slightest you will be very disappointed. First off the Grinch is not even that mean, he loves his dog max and is overly affectionate constantly telling him, ""You can do it max believe in yourself!"" It is 2018 so animal cruelty is out. Secondly they didn't even stick to the script of the classic Grinch we all grew up with. No in this Grinch Cindy Lou is the older child of three with a overworked single mother who's only wish that her mother had it way easier. Because in this Grinch movie Betty Lou is a strong independent woman and she don't need no man. Finally the music of the movie was completely awful, not having one original song. Even after getting through the whole god awful movie, you think to yourself maybe just maybe I can hear one original ""Your a mean one"" at the credits so I can leave going well at least it wasn't a complete waste of money. No, its a weird rap song. So the only thing to do is run out of the movie theater with hopes that you can make it back home to watch a Grinch movie to make up for it. I could go on and on about how I despised this movie, but what I'm trying to get at is if your a Grinch fan don't, DON'T see this movie. The only thing you'll be doing is telling yourself ""this couldn't get any worse"", then be shocked as it gradually hits rock bottom.  Personally, I liked the movie. My only complaint was that there wasn’t really any resolution for Cindy Lou’s wish. I half expected the Grinch to join her family... but the movie will definitely go into the yearly rotation.  Surprised by how much I enjoyed this actually, I only saw it because I'm a Cumberbatch fan and I thought I'd enjoy 90 minutes of him obviously having fun in a sound booth. I don't have many strong feeling for the Carrey film, I was 9 when it came out and liked it but I don't have any super fond nostalgic feelings for it but I can say I liked this one a whole lot more. The Carrey one just feels insufferably preachy to me now, having Cindy Lou Who be like the moral compass for everyone. This one wasn't about society changing it, it was about one person (who you can tell is a good person) who let trauma and anxiety distort his view realize and accept that he was wrong. Also I like how this one didn't go super hard on the whole anti-commercialism message, since the Whos didn't have to learn that message. It just is a sentiment that comes off as hollow and hypocritical when Christmas movies shove it in your face. ",0
2006,"I can see why people in this thread didn't like it, most of the humor is slapstick and there are moments where you are like ""I know what's going to happen, what is the point of watching this?"" but I really appreciate what they did with the character and I'd happily watch it again.  I thought it was pretty cute. Not a big fan of the modernized Grinch song or the weird rap song at the end, but everything else was pretty good. The aggressive God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen was the best song in the movie imo",0
2007,"The short bearded guy is who I aspire to be in life. Just havin a good ol time, obnoxious amounts of Christmas lights, being the happiest person in town, and living in a cool house on a mountain Saw this, the animation was stunning, the acting was good all around, and it was a very cute movie. Not sure why it didn't get better reviews.  My younger self would have liked the humor of this movie. But now that I'm older, many of the slapstick humor and jokes were predictable. Almost fell asleep during the middle of it, but for whatever reason, the ending got me back into the movie.  Haven't seen this and don't plan to, but from the trailers I think it's just such a weird decision to not have Cumberbatch emulate the voice of the narrator from the original cartoon, he could totally pull that voice off! This is definitely the most Harmless, and inoffensive Dr Seuss Movie yet.",0

2013,"One thing is for sure, this movie proves how Spiteful and Offensive Ron Howard's Grinch movie was. Excluding Jim Carrey, that movie is horrible in every way. I’ll say it. I enjoyed this better than the live action one..... ",0
2014,"Jim Carrey was great and all, but that movie has so much unnecessary stuff added to it. This movie has padding to, but it was all connected to The Grinch’s scheme. Him wanting to steal Christmas didn’t just come in at the last minute. ",0
2015,"I also enjoyed the Cindy Lou subplot. Again, it was better than the live action one and actually adapted what Seuss wrote. This time, the who’s actually knew what Christmas was about instead of competing against each other and getting pissy when Christmas was stolen.",0
2016,"The Grinch being more human and relatable might annoy some people, but I had fun with it. The theme song doesn’t match him at all, but other than that nitpick, it was nice to see a version of the character that keeps the concept, but makes it different instead of copy-pasting the past three adaptations. (His relationship with Max was pretty cute to. There’s no reason for him to be treated like crap) The scene with his heart growing looked beautiful, and the fleshed out ending was nice. (Also, thank you writers for not setting him up with Cindy’s mother)",0
2017,"All in all, good movie. I wonder what Warner Bros is gonna do with The Cat In The Hat. ",0
2018," Actually a pretty good movie. The animation was absolutely phenomenal. The narration struck a great balance of classic Dr. Seuss while still being slightly more modern for a more modern generation. The soundtrack was great and I wasn’t expecting Tyler the Creator to do a couple of song; that alone made the movie for me. It was a full length film but it felt pretty short. It’s closer to the Jim Carrey grinch runtime but felt much more like the runtime for the original grinch cartoon. IMO that’s a good thing. The humor while obviously aimed at a younger crowd wasn’t completely unenjoyable. I defintly think it’s a great remake of the classic grinch cartoon.  It's not terrible, exactly what you'd expect from Illumination. ""Despicable Grinch"" basically. ",0
2019,"All this movie did though, was make me appreciate how good Ron Howard's 'The Grinch Who Stole Christmas"" is, and what a great performance Jim Carrey turned out. I relate more to that Grinch who was a social outcast, instead of ""I was never invited to a Christmas dinner so I hate you"" that this one did.  Say what you will about the movie, but I was pleasantly surprised by Pharrell’s narration. [deleted] Man, so they were just embarrassed to call this ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" huh.",0

2026,"Leia and Holdo: ""Ha! That crazy kid, I like him!"" I left the theater Saturday heartbroken after having been extremely excited beforehand to see this film. I get it that Rian Johnson was trying to take the franchise in a new direction, but for me who was more or less happy with the Star Wars universe pre-TLJ, this movie felt like a slap in the face. While I have many issues with the film, there are two I want to highlight.",0
2027,"First, the humor was excessive and over-the-top. It felt out of place and offputting and never allowed me to settle into the film. There were a multitiude of moments where I felt I was watching Guardians of the Galaxy or some other MCU movie. Like clockwork, I could expect a joke to come on screen every 2-3 minutes. I understand that Star Wars can be goofy at times and that the OT had its fair share of silly humor, but TLJ takes it to an extreme level. In this regard, the opening scene has me wondering why Hux is even a character. I think TFA had the perfect balance of comedy and wish this film had followed its lead.",0
2028,"Second, the direction that they take Luke in feels like a betrayal of his character. RoTJ ends with Luke saving his father after having always believed he could be redeemed. TLJ expects me to believe that Luke was willing to kill his own nephew (even if only for a second) after having only felt Kylo harbor dark side inclinations in his dreams. Seriously? Additionally, this happened when Kylo was still a kid under Luke's tutelage and before he had even done anything evil. It's completely out of place with everything we've come to know about who Luke Skywalker is.",0
2029,"There's more (the useless side-plot with Finn and Rose, the complete disregard for any of the questions and mysteries that TFA set up, the fact that in under a week Rey has somehow managed to become the most powerful Jedi in existence), but I'll leave it at that. It kills me that I no longer care about these characters or have a desire to know what happens next. For those who liked the film, I'm really, genuinely glad you did. I'm actually quite jealous.",0

2047,The running gag with one of the toys wanting to frame dad for a crime so he'd have to go back to jail in order to distract everyone had me howling. Thank goodness they finally didn’t leave my boy Combat Carl hanging. Some thoughts:,0
2048,\- Tinny from the antique store was from an original Pixar Short 'Tin Toy',0
2049,\- Why was there no short film!?!,0
2050,\- A small girl behind me at the theater really wanted Woody and Bo Peep to kiss at the end. That would have been weird if they animated that.,0
2051,\-My favorite part was the Oh Canada! music swelling before a Duke Caboom stunt. Woody’s first conversation with Gabby about them both being from the  late 50s really made me wonder what was up with Woody for the 30 something years before Andy in the 90s. ,0
2052,Was he non-sentient until Andy claimed him? This would be in line with Forky not becoming sentient until Bonnie wrote her name on his feet. But we’ve also seen plenty of toys be able to talk and think without having a person claim them.,0
2053,Gabby has clearly been longing for someone to play with her since she came out of the box in the 50s. So why doesn’t Woody have any history beyond Andy? ,0
2054,"For a G-rated film, there sure are a lot of metaphysical questions raised in it. For Bonnie’s dad, this movie was the nightmare scenario trip to end all nightmare scenario trips. Maybe I missed something, but why did Ducky and Bunny end up staying at the carnival instead of going to Bonnie? Didn’t Buzz incentivize them to behave by bringing up Bonnie and her love? But in the end, they said screw it and stayed behind? The long take at the beginning showing Andy playing with his toys and it ending with him giving Woody to Bonnie was beautiful The animation of the rain scene in the beginning was incredible. Just wild how far the animation has come from Toy Story 1 https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/bra4l2/_/eocj9v6/?context=1",0

2057,"This was my favorite line and I couldn't stop laughing. [deleted] I liked how more self contained this one was. And I also like that it recognized that though the story was wrapped up for everyone else, Woody still had some character complexes. He never moved on because Andy was *his* kid, and Bo Peep was *his* soulmate, to put it in the only way I can think to describe it. One thing I loved was that, as far as I know, in the original Toy Story, Bo Peep was supposed to be kind of like Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. Totally bad ass and capable, and would swoop in and save Woody and Buzz at Sid’s house. They ultimately went in another direction, but I liked that they could use that character arc here.",0

I can honestly say Ducky and Bunn's planning scene is the funniest thing i have seen all year. Woody got that Steve Rogers ending huh.

2069,I was absolutely not sold on the Rick Flag/ Enchantress romance. I also couldn't buy El Diablo claiming the squad to be his family.,0
2070,"Performances were good, however, its the writing and plot that are troublesome. ",0
2071,"Editing did also seem strange. An example is one scene, I assume was meant for a minor laugh, where Deadshot opens a cracked glass door only to have it shatter as he does so. Only in the movie, it seems to cut right before the shattering even happens and the scene continues on. This highlights an almost impatient pace the movie has, lending credence to the rumors that the film underwent additional editing by the studio. I found it weird that dr whoever (forgot enchantress' human name) is meant to be an archaeologist - yet the first thing she does when she finds an ancient statue is snap its head off? First day on the job, I reckon. The real suicide squad was the squad who went underwater to blow up Enchantress' brother.  ""That was our main satellite!"" TIL that as long as Will Smith is in a movie, even if it's not advertised, he is the main character and will somehow be the hero in a team of supervillains. Will Smith and Margot didn't disappoint. I liked the characters but the story was just whack. I hate to say it, but I'm still excited for Wonder Woman, Batfleck, and Justice League. I've conceded that the DCEU isn't that great, but they can still make good movies in the future. ",0

Harley stabs the heart, ""Quick gang, we must do x, give me x"". It felt like a scooby doo episode Favorite scene: when Dr. June Moon first calls Enchantress in the meeting of the government higher ups and the dark, dirty hand crawls out from underneath June's and grabs it. Perfect horror movie nuance to that tiny little scene. ",0

2074,"Did that weird anyone else out  The first time Enchantress is called and her hand reaches up and then their bodies flip was an incredibly transition.  Loved it. And....the Joker owns a nightclub? Did I see that right? Very frustrating experience.  The movie starts on a note and just stays there until the very end.  And my god, I thought Fury was good but this film makes me think Ayer can't direct AT ALL.  Nothing but characters in single close-ups and the action scenes were ridiculously incoherent and very poorly choreographed/blocked out.  ",0

2076,"Smith and Robbie were good.  Robbie's ass really managed to deliver a good performance. [Cara Delevingne as an archaeologist ](http://giphy.com/gifs/fail-skull-breaks-ASMX4gR3xadpu) Was anyone else hoping when Enchantress was showing the Squad members ""deepest desires,"" that'd we'd get a shot of Captain Boomerang riding a unicorn?   If Suicide Squad was made in the 80s or 90s it would definitely have used Bad to the Bone in the film/soundtrack.  Can someone explain to me why it was necessary for Katana to be here? It felt like we were halfway through the film, had finally met everyone and were just about to get into battle when all of a sudden someone thinks ""oh shit we forgot Katana"" and they make her jump into the helicopter that's already off the ground?!  My problem with this movie is that the Squad shouldn't have been fighting something as powerful as the Enchantress and her brother. They needed a different villain. She's too powerful for the team. But at the same time filmmakers  decided she needed to fight the Squad by hand as opposed to blowing them up with her machine. She destroying satellites and black site with lightning, but she choose to engage SS by hand. I feel that this movie would've been so much better if the plot had been: ""So we know they got some crazy shit locked up in LexCorp/Wayne Enterprises/S.T.A.R. Labs, we need y'all to break in and steal it...y'all are villains anyway!"" And then the Joker catches wind, also shows up to rescue Harley/cause chaos and fucks up the plan. Ultimately, Waller is exposed as the villain at the end, and the Bruce Wayne cameo in the credits has him demanding more info on these villains and saying that he's on to her. Not only would this be simpler and give more time for the characters to be fleshed out, it would also actually do something to progress the DCEU story forward. Can I just give a quick shout out to Ike Barinholtz? I watched him on Mad TV growing up and now he's in a major motion picture and killed his role as the slimy prison guard. Good on you, Ike.

Definitely a love letter to their father. I didn't know much about the William sisters background before but I was invested the whole time. The actresses they got for the girls in the family were great. Very charming cast all around. I am a sucker for a good sports biopic and I think this was definitely a good one.

He understood that the film was going to suffer in the box office ""bonuses"" actors get from the box office. This movie had good acting, but the protagonist was difficult to cheer for.",1
2099,"Here we have a father of two potential tennis prodigies, who could not afford a decent tennis coach. He then walks all over coaches who offer help, while placing huge bets on his daughter's success at the expense of the coach. ",1
2100,"Serena and Venus were extremely fortunate they had each other to practice with. If it was just one of them, playing on the level of marketability would have been improbable.",1
2101,"I get the point was to show the heart of a badass father, but I can't help but wonder off all the bad things that had happened in the shadows for this to work. Jon Bernthal is hilarious in this. Honestly I wanted more of the compton antics once they got to florida it sorta drops in quality for me I really enjoyed this. Best Will Smith performance I’ve seen in years and really enjoyed the actress who played Venus. As a fan of Venus and Serena, the shot of them with beaded braids was so satisfying. Richard def came off as an asshole at times, & I appreciate that the film didn’t shy away from that to show a nuanced portrait of their family. This is a great movie but if you're a tennis fan at all, namely a fan of Venus and Serena, this is an outstanding movie. I could not help but cry when Venus came out in her white beads for the first time This movie really made a man who abandoned the majority of his kids look like a decent father. I don’t understand everyone in this thread saying how great this movie was. Richard took advantage of everyone in his life and was incredibly stubborn and egotistical and yet I think the movie wanted the audience to root for him. I’m so confused as to how they tried to disneyfied such an asshole of a human being. Will Smith was a lot more subtle and natural in this than his other Oscar type movie performances. I could see him getting nominated. I also thought Aunjanue Ellis was excellent and deserves some accolades. I’m surprised no one else has mentioned Richard Williams’ other family…you know, the mother and six children age 8 and under he abandoned from his first marriage. He allegedly told his oldest daughter he was going out to get her a bike, and never returned. That family lived in poverty thereafter. Serena and Venus came from his second marriage.",1
2102,"Kinda hard to reconcile the image portrayed of him in King Richard with a man who could abandon his children like that. I did not expect the petty criminals in the black *Monte Carlo to have a redemption arc. As someone who grew up watching tennis, I thought this was pretty great. Always figured that Richard Williams is a little larger than life and I thought they portrayed a complex figure really well (and in a way his family agrees with).",1
2103,"I thought Will Smith was chewing up the role a bit in a great way, although I think he accentuated the H's too much compared to what I remember Richard sounding like, I'll tell you h'what. I liked the movie! I wasn’t expecting too much but I was pleasantly surprised. I felt all kind of emotions and Jon. My man Jon, he is just stealing scenes. This is a great example of a straightforward, formulaic movie elevated by \*excellent\* performances and solid direction.",1
2104,Will Smith has a lot of trouble disappearing into roles but he really did it here. I wouldn't be surprised if he won the Best Actor Oscar at all.,1
2105,"Wish there was more awards hype for Jon Bernthal, I thought he was fantastic and played nicely against-type. I think it was a really good movie. Really enjoyed it. ",1
2106,"But I gotta say, after reading about the guy, how the hell can they choose to make a movie about him being a good, dedicated father when the scumbag abandoned 5 of his other first kids???? Looks like he was a good father to Serena and Venus (hence the movie), but if you abandon FIVE of your first kids, by no means can you ever be regarded as a good father let alone have a movie named after you portraying your fatherly figure as positive. ",1
2107,Even Serena and Venus being onboard for this doesn’t make sense when you account for his behavior towards his other kids. ,1
2108,Just read this article featuring his eldest daughter.,1
2109,https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.the-sun.com/news/229940/serena-williams-half-sister-dad-left-mom-six-kids/amp/,1
2110,"As a movie, 4/5, cause I felt they should have showed a little bit more of Serena Williams’ path forwards becoming the best ever, as they focused more on Venus’ path (probably cause she was older). ",1
2111,"You finish thinking, oh this was a good guy, wanting the best for his kids, made sure they enjoyed their childhood too without pushing them too much. But nope after reading he abandoned his other 5 kids (supposedly has a bunch of other kids he’s probably never paid child support to), as a father the guys a scumbag. Will Smith is fantastic here.  This is one of his best performances ever imo.",1
2112,"And Jon Bernthal was awesome as well. Smith was obviously great but Jon Bernthal really surprised me. Not because he was great, because he always is, but because this is so different than anything I’ve ever seen him in. ""You are the most stubborn person I've ever met in my life, and I coached McEnroe."" ",1
2113,"Best line. I loved it, but that generic fart box sound that Will Smith’s character let out during his meeting with the agents was by far the weakest moment of the movie for me. I think this edges out Pursuit of Happyness as Smith’s best role. I forgot it was Smith on screen at times which says a lot because he’s one of those actors that I consider to be hard to not see the actor instead of the character. I wouldn’t be surprised if he gets an oscar nomination since they love movies like this. The supporting cast was also great. Bernthal’s performance was fun and got a lot of laughs out of the audience. The kitchen argument scene with the wife was a standout scene to me. Such good performances from both actors.",1
2114,One thing I don’t get; why did the oldest daughter not come to Florida? Did she just attend college back in Compton? I loved the movie. But I finished with mixed emotions. ,1
2115,"My dad displayed “King Richard” tendencies when I was growing up. I was pretty good at tennis and competed in USTA, but never really fell in love with the sport the way the family did (and as a result never got past the Open-level). I actually grew to resent both my dad and the sport and left it all together. I watched it with my family and got the feeling that I came away with different takeaways than them.",1
2116,"Like Richard was great and all, but only because it worked. I burned out from the expectations, pressure, and I often feel fractured from all the pressure that was put on me (not just tennis, but really everything). ",1
2117,Should we applaud Richard for empowering two of the greatest athletes of all time and a symbol of pride for the Black community? Is this what it takes to be “great”? What about people like Capriati and all the “lesser” athletes like me who never got close? Did their dads and mentors do the right thing as well?,1
2118,"Again, lovely movie and great acting. Found myself tearing up a lot. I guess I’m just using this comment as a journal entry.   ",1
2119,"I saw the movie yesterday, and will smith becomes richard, bravo...i also understand those who say that richard's character is sweetened to make it easier to see ... now my problem is that in the emotional climax of the movie, the talk he has with Venus where he says i do not want you to look up and see your father running in fear as it happened to me as a boy, that whole scene loses all power knowing 5 minutes before that he had abandoned his other children, he became his father and the movie never answers to this...",1
2120,I watched it blind and really enjoyed it. It works as an emotional horror film with some genuinely chilling moments. The mixing of the real world horrors of refugees with the supernatural horror elements was genius. It did seem to follow some cliche-haunted house tropes but I suspect that was on purpose to allow the audience to feel familiar in an unfamiliar narrative.,0
2121,The sunset scene in the ocean is stunning and the meeting of the witch in the dark was haunting (great voice actor).,0
2122,"Some of the ""ghosts"" had a great design while others did look a bit cheesy.",0
2123,For the performances alone it's worth a watch (Wunmi Mosaku is great in everything she's in). ,0
2124,"I did speak to a friend who thought it was ""boring"", so I guess you can't please everyone. I thought it was fantastically crafted. The creature/ghost effects were really well done. Some say it wasn't that scary, but it made my wife scream a couple of times, and we watch a LOT of horror movies. I liked everything about this movie except the explicitly horror parts. The first act of the movie and the revelation about their daughter i.e their horrors not being explicitly about what they had seen getting to where they are but also what they had to do to get there was very well done.  ",0
2125,"The feeling of isolation within the community and being refugees in modern UK was also very well done and felt very true to life (both good and bad--the kids being xenophobic, the social workers being somewhat cold and distainful but ultimately helpful, the local pub offering help and giving Bol an opportunity to bond with them through singing). ",0
2126,"However, the final act and the impact of the ghosts (or the demon or the witch, I'm unclear of the terminology here but the esoteric nature of it does kind of adds to the spookiness) felt like it wrapped up the movie too neatly with a happily ever after ending. It lost the nuance that had been presented throughout the movie by giving their grief, their guilt, and their past a single entity that they had to overcome to free themselves. Bol says ""Your ghosts follow you. They never leave."" but it feels contradictory to the tone of the movie's end.",0
2127,"That all said, it's a great debut from Remi Weekes and I look forward to seeing more of his voice in future movies, it seems he has a lot to say and the know-how to make some great films hopefully. I loved this movie. I didn’t expect or was able to predict any of the scenes. It captivated me from beginning to end. ",0
2128,"I picked to watch it because it looked different - it broke the mould by casting black actors which grabbed my attention as most horror films have a white cast. I was intrigued when it transpired that the main characters were Sudanese refugees in public housing in a congested, noisy, working-class, urban district in England instead of the horror trope most of us are familiar with - upper-class, white people who silently suffer in a vast, isolated Victorian-style mansion set in a remote, country locality.  As the story developed, I was drawn into it as I wondered and questioned whether there were, in fact, spirits tormenting this couple in this house or if it was all in their head as a result of the trauma they had suffered. ",0
2129,I thought the film was very clever because it played on a stereotype many have heard or associate with recipients of public housing – that they are ungrateful and undeserving of this largess because they completely destroy the beautiful houses that they have been provided. We see from the reaction of the government officials how most people would view Bol’s act of stripping all the wallpaper off and leaving huge holes in the walls.  Only the audience  was privy to the mental torment that drove Bol to this act with his hammer. It provided us insight into the world of the people who we judge according to our standards from our privileged background.,0
2130,"I think the film is very clever as it managed to skilfully subvert the horror genre by revealing that the horror each of us live with each day in our real world is far scarier, a point made by Rial who reminds Bol that  she is not scared of ghosts after everything she has seen and experienced in her traumatic life. The film has a universal theme that many of us can relate to – so many of us battle with our personal horrors when the choices we have made in the past and their consequences which we live with now fill us with guilt, shame, mental torment and constantly compel us to question whether we are ‘good people’?",0
2131,"I liked the way the film ended by showing that the people who we meet in our lives, though no longer physically with us, never truly leave us because the ghosts of our encounters with them follow us everywhere we go. It wasn't scary in a traditional sense, but the movie did a good job of cultivating a creepy atmosphere and I liked the design of the witch and the ghosts as well as showcasing a bit of African culture.",0
2132,"Really though, the way they used the witch and ghosts to represent survivor's guilt was very effective and well done.  What's sad and scary is that atrocities like those depicted occur every day and people will do what it takes to survive, but not without a psychological and emotional toll.",0
2133,"I don't see myself ever revisiting the movie, but I'm glad I watched it and appreciated the subject matter and execution.  I do think the second act meandered a bit, but I thought the revelation that it wasn't their daughter was done well and that perhaps in the second act it would've been better to show more of their attempts to adapt to their new lives than what we got. One thing that can always be said about horror movies is that they are a representation on cultural fears. I've seen a lot of people complain that the haunted house aspect ""wasn't scary enough"" or it ""relied on loud noises"" and I think that those people missed what made this movie worth a watch.",0
2134,"In the first 15 minutes, I wasn't scared of the ghost, but of what could happen to these two after seeing their asylum seekers status, the disdain for foreigners, and the glimpse of possible PTSD.  I am lucky enough to have never been in that situation, but knowing how real something like this could be is truely terrifying. Very good film! African folklore is very underrepresented in movies “You are a beast, and I am the butcher”",0
2135,Oddly turned on I really loved Matt Smith's performance in the film. He did a great job showing his characters' contempt for immigrants while maintaining a calm attitude and actually being quite competent in his job of helping the couple.,0
2136," I really hope to see him in more antagonistic roles in the future. The whole ""your house is bigger than mine"" line got my blood boiling. Just watched it going in blind and I was very pleasantly surprised, it’s a solid film.  Great acting by both leads.  Good pacing and tension building.  The jump scares were seldom but were effective.  The makeup and horror elements were well done.  There were some beautiful shots in it, especially the slow pan out from the breakfast table to reveal the ocean.",0
2137,"And finally I really enjoyed the fresh perspective on the classic ‘haunted house’ trope... African refugees and African witchcraft/folklore was not something I knew I wanted, but it worked marvelously and I would welcome more of it.",0
2138,"Keeping an eye on this director.  His debut isn’t perfect but it was a great opening. I thought it was a fantastic way to showcase the effects of grief, guilt, and the desire to ""fit in"". Not super scary, but definitely chilling. The story imo is really well done that I honestly dont mind this not having too many scares. I like films that make me tense and that's exactly what the film did. The twist was amazing, acting was amazing. So this was pretty good...",0
2139,I was hoping Matt Smith would have a larger role.,0
2140,My original theory on the plot (based solely on the trailer) was that Matt Smith was playing an evil government employee secretly trying to drive out immigrants by poisoning their water supply with hallucinogenic drugs so they appeared crazy...,0
2141,But the original plot was pretty good too. Kudos all around.,0
2142,(but what was up with the creepy white neighbor lady? LOL) Very good horror film about survivor's guilt.,0
2143,"But if this were a different film, it could have gone down another perhaps more dangerous rabbit hole.",0
2144,"Namely, what lengths are you willing to go to survive? Is there any point where what you do to survive is immoral? And where is that fine line?",0
2145,"I feel like this film was structured to let Bol off the hook a bit, and give him a nicer send off. And that's fine; its a BBC film, they have their approach and ultimately did a good job. But I'd like to see this same theme explored with different parameters and harder questions asked. I know i'm a bit late.",0
2146,"But i found this movie to be great up until a certain point. Fantastic acting, great setting with the refugees in this weird feeling of isolation, great and creepy horror.",0
2147,Everything was exceptional untill the hangtitty sackman came out of the ground and it casually gets its throat slit and covered up with a rug like wtf.,0
2148,"Still 90% of the movie was great quality, nothing to complaim about only praise. But the ending had me laughing almost Best film of the year. All the greatest horror films have subtext, there was a lot of it here. Visually great too, the scene when the dead were rising out of the water around him was striking. Also the last scene were you see the divide between the survivors and the people who didn't make it. It's brilliant that shot ended up being the poster for the film, by the end you understand why. I loved it. It felt like a somewhat freshman film but that was refreshing honestly.",0
2149,"I loved the imagery and the ghost. The story of the migrant experience. The surrealism. The maze scene was very tense imo. Watch Spell. It was freaky and pretty good. It's like Misery with voodoo. This movie gave me the chills and also the feels. Definitely not a ‘scary’ movie by any means, but really effective use of horror elements to illustrate  the trauma/survivors guilt/ isolation etc. that asylum seekers can experience. Best horror I’ve seen since Midsommar and The House That Jack Built! I love how emotional and real this got, and it works as both a ghost story (backed by folklore) and a drama about survivors guilt. Very moving, and fucking scary at parts! The witch during the dream scene is so memorable. Incoming nightmares. Come to /r/horror for more discussion  about it! This movie is by far my favourite horror of 2020 I loved it, I have a question tho, how did Rial not know Nyagak was not her daughter? She asks the night witch to see her daughter, how does she not know she's not her daughter? Watched this tonight. Sure, might have been slightly cliché with some of the haunted house tropes, but that is a very very minor criticism- mixing it with the immigrant/refugee experience, as well as African witchcraft, super unique. Loved it.",0
2150,"Just here to point out the original story was a One Direction Fan Fiction. Hardin gave off a real Aniken Skywalker vibe. The after series started as one direction fan fiction. The source material is very rinse and repeat and this movie is not much different. The acting is sub-par, with no emotional connection between the leads. They had to fast track so many moment from the book to cram it into a movie that the characters move too fast to make sense, even as young adults making poor decisions. All the crazy conflict from the book is no where to be found in the film, deflating it even further.",0
2151,"2/10, would never watch this movie again. I’m not saying that to be mean either, it just makes no sense to make such an expansive fan fiction into a film like this. In my eyes, it was never going to work. ",0
2152,"I don’t recommend the books either. I think there's nothing inherently wrong with fan fiction - it's fictional characters put in alternative fictional universes, nobody gets hurt and it's a ton of fun.  ",0
2153,"I personally don't know any fanfics that are legitimately great (send them to me if you have some), but there's nothing saying that can't be.  ",0
2154,But I feel that fanfics about an actual person cross some line.  ,0
2155,"Even if we all know that they intentionally created a persona as part of the band, so the Harry Styles this is written about is almost as fictional as Edward from Twilight, it is still very creepy to me.",0
2156,"Like writing and publishing entire sex scenes where one of the people is an actual living person who didn't consent to being in this story has to feel wrong, right?",0
2157,"I guess it's not very different than what tabloids are doing, but everyone hates them. Watched it yesterday with my gf and man we both hated so much this is by far the worst movie i went to watch in theaters My girlfriend and I both enjoy Harry Styles, and I guess she read this fanfiction back in middle school? We thought it’d be funny to watch this, like a “so bad it’s good” kind of thing. Turns out it’s just aggressively mediocre and extremely boring. It just kinda sucks. Wouldn’t recommend even as a joke. I just don't get why Hardin didn't call off the bet when he was falling in love with Tessa? Like if he loved her why did he still show his friends the condom and the bloody sheets? Haven’t seen, I just have a question. Is the relationship in the movie as toxic and abusive as it is in the books? I read them when I was about thirteen. Why does that movie still have no RT score? It opened in over 2000 theatres, there should normally be some reviews for it.",0
2158,EDIT: ,0
2159,"There are already some reviews on RT, all rotten at the moment: RT score 0%",0
2160,"Metacritic score: 31 at my theater this sells pretty fucking well why is it so dead here This movie is just terrible! I read the books last month because I wanted to go see the movie and I was really disappointed. They messed up everything in the book! All the details that make it something have been put aside, the movie is completely rushed and does not make any sense .... It's just sad how Anna Todd sells for half a dozen dollars! Honestly, I didn't hate it as much as I thought I would. I came in with pretty low expectations and was... left feeling disappointed? The plot was as I expected it to be, much too rushed. Their relationship forms too quickly and not organically in the slightest. They told each other very intimate details of their lives far too quickly and they moved in with each other far too fast. The two lead actors had okay chemistry and aside from the atrocious British accent, there wasn't anything that really pissed me off about the acting. The girl could play the nerdy virgin and the dude could play the bad boy with a ""deep side"" (hint hint, drinking problems and daddy issues). There was a toxic relationship that gets really played down. Harding beats up one of their mutual friends for attempting to kiss her though they're not even dating and it struck me as very possessive. After the ""big reveal"" I just lost all hope. In all honesty, it was a bit surprising that Tessa would go back to Harding, but then I remembered, it was adapted from a Wattpad fan fiction. I've read many a Wattpad fanfic in my younger years and this was the same unoriginal plot and toxic relationship. Don't come to this movie with high expectations. My friends and I spent our time ragging on the movie which was pretty fun. I’m a guy who usually enjoys all kinds of romance, and despite knowing the origins of After (fan fiction and the book) I didn’t know what the film would be about. Personally, I don’t find anything wrong with it except that it is kinda boring, nothing really interesting happens and the relation between the two mains is very mundane. I don’t see why you would put that into a film, if the guy was more of a mess or even violent it would have given some depth.",0
2161,"Went to see it with me mum and being a 50 Shades of Grey fan, she said she liked After better. So if you liked 50 Shades, you heard me mum. I read these books a long time ago.. i got completely sucked in for some mad reason. So when i saw the  movie pop up on Netflix, I just had to watch it. I think the movie was a healthier way of portraying the relationship, which was good idea.  But one thing that drove me absolutely crazy was the fact that Hero FT kept his eyes open during a lot of the kissing scenes which I found sooo weird. I copped it from the lake scene and numerous kissing scenes!! How on earth was it not said to him when they were filming??? i’m just rlly looking forward to awc , i think we are gonna see a lot more of the book hardin that we all love! and adore also they had to make it pg 13 which made their relationship look like a semi healthy relationship but in awc i think they’re gonna be a lot more book hessa scenes that we all love and need!!!! i know this is old now, but I am just getting to watch these. can someone explain to me if Tessa loses her virginity in the scene she comforts Hardin in his house after he destroys things in a drunken rage? I feel like they first have sex after his dads wedding, but they fooled around earlier in the movie too, and it wasn’t obvious if they had sex there. [I listened to a review of the novel](http://www.frowl.org/worstbestsellers/episode-119-after/) and the author apparently had no idea how college worked because it's treated like high school in the book. Which makes sense because I'm pretty sure the author was in high school when she wrote it. it also reads like a sex crimes playbook. Glad to hear this is terrible. Made my night. Hoping for worse ratings that Hellboy here! Unpopular opinion here but I enjoyed the movie and will watch it again when it's released.  I don't think it would be a good movie for someone to watch that hasn't read the books. Granted, the movie is very mild compared to the books, but I think they did an ok job portraying the characters.",0
2162,I think the movies layout was like that to introduce the characters to people that haven't read the books. I think if it gets approved for another movie that the 2nd installment will have more meat in it.,0
2163,"If you liked fifty shades of grey, twilight, or anything with that sort of ""bad boy,"" ""good girl"" vibe, then you will enjoy the series. I agree. But I'm guessing people take it in the same vein as shows or movies that have actual actors playing them. Like are the writers really thinking about iron man and captain America in a romantic relationship or are they actually thinking about the actors. ",0
2164,"I don't know, rambling. Wait where was that in the movie ? I saw it twice and I missed that I personally think that he was trying to fight that he loved her and this it was a form of self sabotage. He didn’t think he deserved Tessa and he didn’t want to admit to his feelings for her so he was being a childish asshole. It’s WAY I mean WAY more toxic in the books. ",0
2165,I’ve read the After books on wattpad and what you see in the movie is like 1/10th of what’s in the books.,0
2166,"I always wanted to see chubby Aragorn eat a pizza like that.  The scene where Shirley thought Tony was going to leave him for his friends when he was going downstairs to the bar. That scene was just.... I don't even know, such a heartbreaking and heartwarming moment at the same time. Kept thinking about it so I had to come here to comment it.",1
2167,"The fact that Don Shirley was such a high and mighty person, seeing him basically stoop down so low (figuratively) so he wouldn't lose Tony. And then Tony making it clear that leaving wasn't in his intentions at all.",1
2168,"Just Bravo to those two men for that scene. Teared up in the best way possible When Tony’s wife hugged Dr Shirley and thanked him for helping Tony with the letters everyone in the theater laughed. It was the perfect way to end the movie.  Really didn't expect to like this as much as I did, but now I can clearly see why this won the People's Choice Award at TIFF.",1
2169,There's not much to not like about this. It's an extremely charming film.,1
2170,"Amazing chemistry between Mortensen and Ali, with some truly great performances as well between the both of them. Forgot how good of an actor Mortensen is and this may be one of my favourite characters he's played. I couldn't tell you who won performance wise though, they're both great.",1
2171,"It's actually a genuinely funny movie too, which shouldn't be that big of a surprise considering it's directed by Peter Farrelly. It doesn't overdo the funny though, it still manages to be extremely topical and hit some very poignant and dramatic moments throughout.",1
2172,"Really, my biggest complaint is that maybe it's TOO competent. It's very crowd pleasing and it panders a bit. It's a little predictable. It does all the right things right on the nose. Crowds will love this movie, I'd say the majority of people will really enjoy it... Well unless you're from the Southern United States... It's a bit of a 'fuck you' to Ya'll.",1
2173,"Still, any complaint I have is overshadowed by the great chemistry between the two leads, and the sheer amount of charm that comes out of this film.",1
2174,"Watch it with your mom, she'll fucking love it. I saw most of the humor coming from a mile away, but goddamn if that gun bit didn't get a legitimate snort out of me. I know I'm late, but man, Linda Cardellini is still fine AF.",1
2175,"Oh, and the rest of the.movie was good too I guess.",1
2176," I can’t say the trailer did anything for me but, I rock with Marheshala ever since House of Cards and Moonlight, that I went to see it regardless. ",1
2177,I am so glad I did! What a wild but beautiful story! ,1
2178,"I don’t know if it was intentional or not but, there are so many one liners, mannerisms, and interactions that had me and the rest of the theater cracking up. For as heavy the story of Don Shirley can get, the film truly left me in such high spirits. If you get the chance to watch this film, I highly recommend it.    Favorite movie of the year for me. The kind of film I wish I had the skill to write. Just lovely.  Every time Viggo or has family opened their mouths I had a stupid smile on my face. My grandpa was the last Italian in my family that encouraged that same type of culture of the big family meals, the loud shouting for no reason at the tv, and that quick witted humor. There were a good amount of one liner retorts that made me think grandpa was in the movie, like when one of Tony's brothers was asked to write a letter like Tony did and they said they'd write a letter when she cooked a meal. I'm curious if people that didn't have the firsthand big Italian family experience thought it was as hilarious and endearing to see their interactions. ",1
2179,"Anyways, best acting of the year so far, satisfying story that will appeal to a huge range of audiences,  I usually yawn at the “feel good Oscar movie” because frankly they all just feel the same. I had zero anticipation to see what the trailers make seem like a reverse Driving Miss Daisy but I absolutely loved this film. Viggo is great. I laughed, I got angry, and even teared up at the end. Solid 4.5/5  Shout out to my man Joe Pan. Greatest pianist ever. All I'll say is that this is from one of the guys who directed Dumb and Dumber and it surprises me with happiness that he made this film so many years later [deleted] Tony's arc was a little confusing in the beginning? He literally tossed those glasses in the trash which was an extremely malicious and petty thing to do, but he was downright cordial with and respectful of pretty much every black character he interacted with after. I mean he definitely says some ignorant things but the initial scene with the contractors felt so incongruent with the rest of his narrative... ""The world is full of lonely people afraid to make the first move.""",1
2180,"sob sob..... I think Mahershala Ali will be the one beat for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars. I don't remember the last time I've felt that a movie has a heart like this one. I'm not gonna even discuss the acting, it was magnificent. I was also very happy to see an actor who actually eats in a movie, I know it's silly detail, but it has always bothered me. I think it's really hard to portray a story like this without being cheesy. There was no unnecessary dialog, scene or anything for that matter. I was thinking Rami Malek gave an unbeatable performance this year, but Viggo Mortensen's performance tops that and every other performance in 2018 (or maybe even for the last few years)   Some might call it Oscar bait and there’s some real criticism on the film’s lack of nuance, but it really is a beautiful film set with amazing performances throughout. The dialogue and the music really made it for me. Brilliant film, didn’t expect to laugh as much as I did. Both of their performances will earn them noms (Ali more chance of winning).",1
2181,"His speech after deciding to walk in the rain instead of drive with Tony was powerful.  [deleted] One thing really bugs me about this movie. In the beginning, Tony is so racist he throws glasses away just because black people drank from them. 10 minutes later, he takes a job working for a black man? Really?",1
2182,"I feel that just cutting the glasses throwing out of the movie would make a lot more sense. I felt that Tony wasn't the ""hatefully-racist"", but more the casually racist type of character. Like, sure, he assumes all black people eat KFC, but he doesn't look like he thinks all black people are dirty. This movie reminds me of a great   90s movie. I don't know how to describe it. A feeling that you get watching Forrest Gump, Shawshank Redemption. Cast Away, and etc.",1
2183,This movie was great [deleted] That shot where the black people were working in the field and stopped to look at Shirley was very powerful. It's a feel good movie that tackled race better than most movies now of days.,1
2184,"However, there was one thing I didn't like about the movie. Tony and Shirley are clearly the main characters, but it felt like Tony was more of a main character. The opening sequence revolved around Tony and Tony also got the better end of movie *""I've changed""* scene. I would've liked to see them end Shirley's arc with his brother or possibly his ex-wife instead of seeing him choosing to sit on a normal chair compared to his throne. They also could've shown how the travel and the friendship changed him in a manner as well as they did with Tony. With how many powerful moments his character had, Shirley's character arc should've had a better conclusion.",1
2185,"Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the movie. Seeing a working class Italian-American and upper class African-American go on a road trip through the South is the a story I never realized I badly wanted to see.  I just watched the movie, the trailer really intrigued me and after seeing the comments here on Reddit (mostly saying how “basic” it was) I had to see it.",1
2186,I absolutely loved it. I seriously cannot understand some of the hate I see here on Reddit from time to time. It’s like every movie needs to be like citizen kane or psico (brilliant masterpieces) so that it can be good.,1
2187,It’s a good story and it’s a movie that catches your attention from the beginning until the end. It’s a story about learning and about friendship. The racism scenes aren’t super powerful but regardless they are still present. ,1
2188,"I definitely enjoyed it and I wouldn’t be surprised if it won multiple awards. Honestly, one of the best movies I have seen in a while and will probably rewatch it sooner then later",1
2189,"As a Korean, I have nothing but admiration for Steven Yeun. I still remember cracking up when he spoke broken Korean in Okja and Burning (used as a comedic effect), but in Minari, his Korean is nearly perfect. Korean is one of the most difficult languages to master in pronunciation, and it’s clear that he took the time to make his performance as authentic as possible. when david ran after his grandma at the end i immediately started crying. good movie Steven Yeun is arguably doing better than any of his Walking Dead costars at the moment. He deserves am oscar nom for this film Asian Grandmothers are always the show stealers. The kid was adorable. A good somewhat heartbreaking film. However, I don't understand why they would have their trash barrel that close to the food storage shed. [deleted] Just finished watching it with my brothers. Going to watch it again with our parents as a whole family.",1
2190,"As a fellow Asian-American immigrant, this movie means so much to me. It was the first time in cinema that I saw my family and there were so many moments that had me recalling my own childhood and my own experiences. Representation has always mattered and I truly understand why now.",1
2191,"It’s also just a really beautiful film. Well-written and well-paced, it never felt too long or overbearing. The acting was top notch and Alan Kim just makes me want to adopt him.",1
2192,"Definitely worth the watch, especially if you’re coming from an Asian background.",1
2193,"Also, I miss my grandma. The acting chemistry between the boy and grandma was astounding. Alan Kim truly deserves all the praise for his role in this. “Minari, Minari, Wonderful, Wonderful”",1
2194,"A sweet, tender, and authentic look into a Korean family moving into the United States and vying for that elusive American Dream. Sometimes that Dream can be so intoxicating that it can get in the way of family and the failure can be devastating.",1
2195,You can tell this was close to the heart of writer/director Lee Isaac Chung and surely inspired from his childhood. Assimilation into any foreign  culture can be difficult and is unique for every family.,1
2196,"Great performances from the cast especially the female leads. Minari is one best films of 2020 A new thing I picked upon a rewatch of the film. During the first major row between Monica and Jacob, she chastises him for sending money and providing for his side of the family over hers, and later on with Jacob's defensive resentment over Monica calling their current living environment as being that of 'hillbillies'. Little touches like this make me think that Jacob probably came from a poor family initially, and probably grew up in the countryside in contrast to Monica who must've grown up in the city. He probably picked up the idea for growing Korean vegetables from his childhood.",1
2197,"Jacob doesn't socialise as easily as Monica. Take for example at the church's social gathering, and many other occasions, he just can't seem to open himself up to people. And it's not even a language thing - his English is noticeably better than Monica's, he just can't. He's very pent up, only Paul and David seem to really be able to crack his facade at points and even then it's very momentary. He doesn't seem to have much going for him besides his dream.",1
2198,"In a sense the whole film is Jacob trying to live out a youthful dream and gradually watch it get torn apart. The entire film you watch Steven Yeun's face as his soul crumbles underneath. Devastating. My favorite film of this awards season. Would love to see Yuh-Jung Youn get a supporting actress nom for this, she was incredible. I really loved how non-showy it was. It felt so down to Earth. I think the film could have done more to explore Anne's perception of events, but it has some of the best emotional payoff I've seen of any 2020 film. Giving the grandmother a stroke right after her big bonding moment with David also seemed like a bit of a shortcut to drama, but Youn's performance still made me feel terrified for her well being. I think the Supporting Actress race this year is between her and Bakalova. Can we talk about how vividly realised the sense of history between Monica and Jacob was? I love films where without flashbacks or even obvious dialogue, we get such a beautiful sense of their relationship and how it has come to this point. Really so much credit to the screenplay and how it creates the richness of the interactions with one another, as well as the actors. The scene between Yeun and Han as Monica is bathing Jacob in the bathtub speaks volumes (also, Steven Yeun's biceps tho). I have known about Alan Kim for two hours but if anything happened to him I would kill everyone in this movie and then myself Had no idea Brad Pitt was a producer for this film.",1
2199,"I'm assuming this is the same Brad Pitt that is the actor(?) Between loving Mountain Dew and being annoyed by old people, 7-year old David has the same energy as many of my 35-year old friends. The academy award goes to Alan Kim in his little cowboy boots Couldn’t find a weak talent in the movie. The entire cast was amazing with heavy praise for Yeun and the grandma. ",1
2200,I hope more people see the hard working life immigrants go through. And their resilience of never giving up. God bless this movie. God bless these true American stories being told. ,1
2201,"Most of all god bless Alan Kim Steven Yeun and Alan Kim are getting all the praises, as they should be, but I was especially touched by acting by the ladies who portrayed the grandma and the wife. Youn as the grandma was striking and much deserves the attention but the wife especially was heartbreaking to watch in a more subtle, delicate way. That scene of the couple’s fight close to the end, her unshed tears really got to me. Trying to be a realist in the face of her husband’s dream, or the bit about how he sent his parents in Korea the money they made because he’s the first son in the family, so they have little money left for themselves but she can’t even be unhappy about it without her husband getting angry... all of that hit really close to home. I saw it yesterday in a cinema in Sydney (it was released here last Thursday). I absolutely loved it and can’t stop thinking about it. I think the grandmother truly came to heal the family, even if they didn’t realise it. I don’t want to say too much more and spoil it, but if you haven’t seen it - go. You’ll laugh and cry, and be uplifted by an authentic, deeply moving, beautifully told film. I never thought Glenn from The Walking Dead would ever be on of my favorite actors, but goddamn Steven Yeun has been killing since he left TWD. He is a very talented actor with a penchant for choosing great films to be a part of. What are people's thoughts on the ending?  That he showed in saving her from the fire that he cared about family after all?  That she's staying out of guilt, and they're still doomed? That they've learned through the fire that if they can survive that, they can survive anything?",1
2202,"I guess as I write this, I'm learning toward some of each, but mostly the last one, since it meshes with his statement about the resilience of the minari, and that being the title and all... The scene of Jacob kneeling down in the fields smoking, distraught over the collapse of his dreams and the pain it's caused his family, and the final shot of Soon-ja's face looking over the family as they sleep, are such incredible scenes. For a film as beautifully written as this, it's amazing how its two best moments are entirely silent outside of that gorgeous Emile Mosseri score. Truly a universal film. Easily my favourite film of this awards season, hands down. So the A24 Screening Room kicked me out to a Q&A ten minutes before the movie ended, and then it 404'd repeatedly when I tried to go back to the movie until it said that I could no longer view it.",1
2203,"Well, it was a great film but I wish I could see the ending! Okay I'm not seeing this anywhere else but I thought there was significance in the grandma's stroke and David's heart healing. To me it was exchange, but further than one good and one bad occurrence. It was almost as if Soonja (the grandma) sacrificed a bit of herself, and gave up some of her life for David. In the dialogue before they both fell asleep that night, she was talking of protecting him, and then she woke up to illness. Not sure if this was intentional but something I noticed right away when i watched, especially with the religious/spiritual element of the film.",1
2204,Ercole broke the lame disney streak of hidden villains by being a dick and just getting *worse* as the movie went on lol I was waiting the whole movie for some tragic backstory to explain why Ercole is the way he is. ,0

Just so Lowe stakes.",0
2206,"The dad was this amazing character. He was such a softy. They kinda showed it where he said like ""nah I was born this way"" I loved this movie. From then light hearted but meaningful storyline to the amazingly beautiful animation. People always want the next Soul or Inside Out but movies like Luca are just as good. So I'm pretty sure Bruno is Alberto's dad's name, right? I’m starting an Easter egg thread.  ",0

2214,"Portorosso is a reference to Studio Ghibli’s “ Porco Rosso” which also takes place on the Italian coast.  The credits sequence with sketches showing everyone’s future adventures is used in a lot of Ghibli films like “ My Neighbor Totoro” and “ Kiki’s Delivery Service.” Why does Maya Rudolph play the mom in every animated movie and why does it catch me off guard every time? The bully kid looked like a young Chef Skinner from *Ratatouille*. I really \*loved\* the ending. I thought it was nice that Alberto stayed behind with the dad (after having lost his own father), and didn't follow Luca and Giulia. Every character got their own happy ending. This movie told the story about redemption and forgiveness that Raya and the Last Dragon wanted to tell. I love that the Pixar movies just always seem to be getting more beautiful looking. The city setting itself was just so alive and fun, but I was blown away by the first island and how the scenery looked. This met my expectations and then some. Part of me thought the antagonist's fate was gonna be him accidentally stabbing himself with the harpoon, especially with the way he started surfing on the bike This felt very emotional as an Italian to watch. It's not as big of a movie as some of the known masterpieces from Pixar but I loved it nonetheless. “Made in our slippers in various parts of the Bay Area” My name is Luca. I live on the ocean floor... The Italian is so aggressive in this movie that it needs Giorno’s theme There seems to be a narrative going around that its one of Pixar’s weaker fare on the level of Good Dinosaur and maybe part of that is because it went straight to Disney+.",0
2215,But I have to say I did not find that to be the case. Perhaps my expectations were lowered because of the discussion surrounding the film but I enjoyed it quite a bit.,0
2216,Sure the stakes are lower and its not pushing any boundaries creatively like Inside Out or Soul but its much closer to Pixar’s usual quality than something like Good Dinosaur.,0
2217,"The lighthearted, warm kids story with a strong message worked really well and the smaller scale and stakes made it much more relatable and whimsical to me.",0

2220,"Felt it was subtle, but Julias fathers acceptance of the boys wasn't just ""I like her friends"". He had one arm not because of a sea monster, that's just the way that he was born. Same thing. Luca and Alberto were born that way, so what? ",0
2221,"My kid ranked it an 8/10, which is a pretty high score from him. I appreciated how lighthearted and enjoyable this film was. Sure there was a “message” but it was very straightforward and plainly laid out. I liked that there was no complicated twist or unexpected villains like many animated films. It was just a easy-going enjoyable film. Best Vespa commercial of all time. I love, love, love this movie. When I first saw the trailer for it a month or two ago, at first I dismissed it as being something forgettable and silly. But within’ the last few weeks as more trailers came out, suddenly I was super excited to see it. Was counting down the days until today, and I really enjoyed it. The animation was adorable, and I loved the story and characters. I really liked Alberto, he was hiding so much loneliness and insecurity behind that confident demeanor. This is my favorite to come out of Pixar in a long long time! At this point Pixar is just straight flexing their animation being the best there is.",0

Last Christmas he gave her his heart 😢 I knew what to expect going into the movie and loved every part of it. Michelle Yoeh & Emilia Clarke being the highlights. Both laughed and cried. But to be fair, I do enjoy these cheesy movies (and I love christmas) so thats that. I just came out sad, tbh. I didn’t see him being a ghost, I saw him being a product of a severe mental breakdown. The scenes that show of her doing everything alone when she thought she was doing it with him just made me extremely sorrowful for this girl who was deeply ill and completely delusional without even realising it. I felt the movie marketing was completely misleading and felt quite cheated out of my Christmas cheer hah. Did anyone else think Tom was going to end up being Santa's dead son and that is why she kept giving Kate all those chances at the shop? And that she knew that Kate was living with Tom's heart.  That would have been over the top even for this movie. It's been a few hours and I'm mad Tom and Kate can't be together This is a movie you take your mom to see because you’ve been neglecting her forever and matinees are cheap. Then you take her to Bennigan's after for a tepid meal and have her home before Sunday Night Football Holy shit, I’m so fucking happy they went with that twist. I couldn’t stop laughing, but I loved it so much. Playing “Last Christmas” right after was a beautiful touch It's like Joker but instead of ending in tragedy, the imaginary relationship helps you get your shit together instead. Come for the M Night Shyamalan plot twist, stay for the Lesbian Pudding. I really enjoyed this movie. It had plenty of rom com-xmas movie tropes and plenty of laughs. >!While I did suspect he was a ghost, I expected it to be more like ""the ghost of xmas past"" kind of thing, and he would somehow find a way to become human and be with her. What I did NOT see coming was that the heart was his and he was the donor. The fact they didnt end up together, for obvious reasons, and that he was very much dead, really made it bittersweet for me.!< Had it not been for that, this movie would have ended up as a must have and must re-watch many times. If only he had looked up (and seen the bus) Also..I think the sixth sense has forever ruined the ""surprise"" that a character is dead the entire time thing.  As soon as you see a whole hour go by with a character not interacting with anyone else, people keep asking who or where he was, etc.  It becomes obvious Saw it tonight and it wasn't that bad. A piece of fluff but not too bad as far as pieces of fluff go.  Emilia Clarke is very charismatic and shines. Michelle Yeoh practically steals the movie. Some of the jokes fell flat at my showing but the audience seemed to eat it up.",0
2226,I had a few problems with it - shoehorning some of the George Michael songs into places that don't quite line up and the bit about xenophobia seemed really out of place in what is supposed to be a light comedy.,0
2227,"The big twist you could see coming a mile away though.  (Last Christmas I gave you my heart... literally.) I want to watch a movie where I can finally have a good laugh, a bit of crying and feel better with myself in the end.. I think this one would do😍",0
2228,"Edit: have to say that since it took inspiration from the song there is no way the plot twist would have been unpredictable... but knowing it didn’t take anything away from the enjoyment of watching this movie .... also hands down Emilia completely steals the movie... great performance I just saw this movie and quite honestly I don't give a shit about the plot. Emilia Clarke smiling, being silly and wholesome needs to be its own genre with like a thousand movies. I can't get enough and she fills me with joy.",0
2229,"To edit in some actual thoughts lol. I really didn't give a damn about the ""relationship"" because it was just too obvious it was just a conduit for her to be better. On the other hand her relationship with Santa and her mom were the actual highlights. It was a cute story and I found it endearing that the lyrics quite are literally the movie. It was time well spent I love these flicks. I think this is Emilia Clark's best role since Game of Thrones - she turns the charm up to 11 here.",0
2230,"And now I want a Christmas Gibbon. I really liked this movie, thought it was cute. The twist was somewhat expected, but I didn't expect it to go in that direction.",0
2231,"Still got me to cry lol I had no idea about Tom. Throughout the movie, I did wonder if he was somehow Santa Claus or a spirit that guides her. Eventually I gave up that idea though.

How did those raccoons live for almost 500 days?! I just want to say congrats to my theatre for staying quiet the whole film The entire movie I couldn't stop wondering on what their bathroom situation was.  [deleted] I loved the movie and am planning on seeing it again soon! But I was hoping another viewer could help me understand why the dad seemed so adamant[that the daughter not go down into the basement](#spoiler). The gravity and intensity of the scene forbidding her descent didn't match the actual consequences of her going down there.

Did anyone else notice that in the supermarket, everything was gone except for the things in noisy plastic bags like chips? I thought that was a wonderful touch. When the monster was in the water with Emily Blunt and her baby, I thought she was going to have to smother it. My heart just dropped as that happened. I got MASH finale flashbacks.

The fear in Noah’s eyes once his character realized that his leg was stuck in the bear trap...you could almost tell the exact moment where the pain really kicked in after the shock. That was the only scene that made me audibly gasp in the theatre. I’m so impressed with their performances, and I would almost watch an entire movie with just the two of them Love that the movie was not afraid to show the monsters. They were not just dark blobs jumping out from the shadows to eat people. I thought they did the Day 1 scene really well. Especially showing the slow panic once they noticed the meteors. I could see that exact same chain of events happening in real life. One thing that really bugged me is that the creatures dont know how to swim and yet our military somehow still lost the war??",0

I don't know why but the opening outbreak scene gave me legit goosebumps. Something about the way it happened felt uneasy and felt a sense of impending doom Also, in what world did folks ever imagine Jim from The Office would go on to be an action star in his own series and direct a film that grossed hundreds of millions of dollars worldwide? The callback of Cillian/Emmett signaling Reagan ""dive!"" gave me the chilliest chills in a movie recently. What was with Scoot McNairy on the docks? Great actor and he didn’t have a single line. Overall I enjoyed it but I found that to be so weird. They need to put a boat on the water with no one in it and just blast music from it. Aliens jump after it and drown. The end",0

I also never realized that the names of the characters were never disclosed in the first movie. If they were, then I definitely missed it. I loved how subtly Krasinski’s character’s name was revealed in the beginning, and how Jupe’s name was revealed in such an intense moment. It really brought out Emily Blunt’s disparity as she was trying to calm him in such a suspenseful situation At some point or another I felt like I was watching Aliens, Stranger Things, Wrong Turn, and the Last Of Us... But that's not a complaint. Absolutely loved this movie... Even more so than the first one. Haven't been to the theater since the pandemic started but I had to see this in imax on the big screen. 9/10 Time to stock up on hearing aids. You never know when the next alien invasion will be. The kids are the heroes of A Quiet Place Part II, but the unsung hero of both movies is the hearing aid.

2260,Chapter 3: Reagan gets her foot blown off by a landmine (?) I liked watching the monsters absolutely smash the fuck out of groups of people lmao The most interesting thing to me about the prologue was the tactical advantage that the family had from the start by already being able to speak sign language. It’s something I never considered but of course that is part of the reason they survived in the first place. Noah Jupe is gonna get everyone killed more than that damn baby 😒,0

2262,"Comedy gold. If I read it right, if you look at the media screen in Razorfist's car, he had been listening to his own mixtape. Anyone else catch that to finish the big bad Shang Chi used his mom's open palm stance to subdue him and then his dad's closed fist stance to kill him? Talk about yin yang and self realization I was hurt when Guang Bo died not gonna lie. But if there's any Kim's Convenience fans out here there was a small nod to the show where Shang talks about someone thinking he was Korean. That bus fight was the best fight I've seen in a Marvel movie in ages. But then they did the building/scaffolding fight and I thought the same thing. ",0
2263,And then all the beautiful dance choreography fighting. ,0
2264,"Ugh. I could watch that stuff all day. No one mentioned the airplane scene. Veggie or beef! Lol perfect timing to keep the viewer on their toes without making it too corny. I feel black widow had too much miss timed cheese.  This movie - it felt better Small thing I really liked was how Trevor Slattery mentions how he got himself clean off the drugs, making the necessary changes to become worthy enough to enter Ta Lo. I’m just glad that the western world is finally getting to see the greatness they is Tony Leung. What an incredible performance by the entire cast, but by god, that man can act his ten rings off. ""I speak ABC"" is such a cool double entendre. His mom gets beaten to death by a group of 50 dudes and she ends up looking like she died peacefully in her sleep I like Simu but he was really drowned out by the charm and charisma of everyone else, including Awkwafina, Ben Kingsley, but especially Tony Leung. Not really his fault, the character was just a tad too vanilla. I've never wished for a movie to make money before but this is it. Covid is all over the place and last I heard China still doesn't have a release date but this film deserves to be  successful. I was impressed They made the rings so much cooler than I could have possibly imagined. [The movie without context](https://i.imgur.com/gcVZmNq.jpg) Asian dad will always be disappointed ",0

2269,"Her teacher probably won't believe her when she tells him/her that a dude with a sword for a hand sliced her laptop in two on her way to school. So, why is Awkwafina in the post credits with Wong, is she another Avenger now?  She had a great part in the movie, but as far as the Avengers, it’s like having Ned join Peter. 10/10 for an origin story. Came in knowing very little and walked out entertained and invested in the whole cast. The fight choreography was by far the best in MCU movie IMP. The blending of a ""kung fu"" and ""super hero"" was awesome. ",0
2270,"And, there was a battle between dragons. Just awesome. ",0
2271,The acting was a little stiff at times but still shot to maybe one of my favorite MCU movies Seeing the Marvel Studios intro on the big screen again felt so damn good! ,0
2272,"Btw, it’s blink and you’ll miss it, but there was a shot of Natasha and Yelena from Black Widow in it! Looks like they’re going to update it movie by movie which is cool! Funniest part of seeing the movie in theaters was the No Time To Die trailer that played before and still said “April 2020” at the end. Omg that play dead scene had me BURSTING in laughter Hong Kong superstar Toney Leung plays a great villain and has the acting chops to back it. ",0
2273,Overall this might have the most thrilling action sequences in the whole MCU.,0

2275," I spent the entire movie thinking about how her uncle looked exactly like a younger/more handsome Vladimir Putin. Starting from when she hits Budapest, up to final scene, it is never obvious or clear who she is working for. In the 2nd act she seems to be playing everyone.  Did she intentionally set up her roomate? As the movie ends, where do her loyalties lie?  It seemed to me to be a great movie about someone who is handed a poop sandwich and manages ti survive if not come out on top. And loved that didn't just defect, that would have been facile.

2280,Quick Question:,0
2281,"At my showing the power went out and they said they were gonna restart all the movies but the movie was just about over. The screen went black at the end when she was at the ballet walking down the steps after she visited her mother, does anything else happen after that? ",0
2282, Sat through entire movie.,0
2283,As a bird watcher I didn’t not see what I expected.,0
2284,"5/10 Saw the movie this afternoon and it took me a few hours to decide how I really feel about it. Overall I had a pretty good time, I’m always game for a slow paced spy movie. While there are certainly issues with the script and some of the brutality, I feel like a lot of the hate is underserved. It had some really tight sequences of suspense, particularly the scene on the runway. While it isn’t the easiest movie to watch, I was really engrossed by the story and Jennifer Lawrence’s performance, accent aside. If you’re willing to look past some of its faults, this is a pretty worthy successor to the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  Can someone help me out with the massive plot hole that Egorov couldn't have been Marble, because he has a fucking alibi by being at the ballet when Nash + Marble were spotted in the park? I wanted to throw things at the screen at the end. ",0
2285,"The way it was cut, I felt like I had no choice but to believe that the two scenes took place simultaneously.",0
2286,"Am I losing my mind?  The scene that stood out to me the most was when she vomited after hearing the click of the empty gun. I thought that her reaction was very human and very well done.  Correct me if I’m wrong, but the whole plot is basically J Law getting back at her uncle for being a dick? Mary Louise Parker...lmao Watched it. Liked it. I'll forget about it by next week. ***Why*** would you have sex with this woman, Nate Nash? She is a walking pile of red flags on top of a flashing neon sign reading I AM A HONEY TRAP.",0
2287,"Given that JLaw's whole schtick was being able to read people and the academy pushed sex as a manipulative tool so much, I actually would have found it a neat twist for her to say ""this guy doesn't want sex. He's shown himself to get overly emotionally involved in protecting his source, but not in a sexual way. He just wants a vulnerable source and he's the only guy who can contact them and he's the only guy who can protect them. It's a power thing and a protective thing, but not in a sexual way, he's just out to prove that he's a great agent. So I won't fuck him, I'll just keep making myself look vulnerable and battered by the Russians, and that'll be enough to lure him in."" ",0
2288,"As soon as he, a seasoned CIA agent who knows that she's a Russian sexspy with an uncle in high places, fucked her, that's when I checked out. It wasn't necessary. I know I will be in the minority when I saw this...but I really, really genuinely enjoyed this film. Firstly, not only did I *not* think it was too long, I in fact thought the pacing of the film was great. The soundtrack by James Newton Howard was riveting, with the track ""Didn't I Do Well?"" being a bop. I found that Jennifer Lawrence did a good job (I don't think I have the linguistic authority to judge an actor's Russian accent), and I actually believed the violence and sexual content to be grounded and not at all egregious. ",0
2289,"Conversely, I will agree with the critics that it was tricky to find chemistry between JLaw and Joel Edgerton. Despite this, I had an extremely fun time viewing this film, and all of its twists. Daresay...I may see it again with a friend?...I have MoviePass so it wouldn't be any extra financial burden.",0
2290,"Anyway, *Red Sparrow* was a really enjoyable film that I found to be well-made, and upon which people are hating for the sake of doing so. I know this was a big part of the book, but the movie didn't need to have that entire Sparrow/Sex School act that took close to half an hour.",0
2291,"It was wildly incongruent with the rest of the movie, as Dominika doesn't use seduction or sex in her actual spy activities - instead just using standard spycraft. To the average moviegoer who has not read the book, the Sparrow School plot would seem like ridiculous editing and directorial mistake.",0
2292,"Removing this would also make the pacing much better. For a R-rated spy thriller with as much violence and sex as this had I sure was bored out of my skull. Also everyone not played by Jennifer Lawrence is made out to be absurdly stupid. What a disappointment.  Did anybody else dislike Mary Louise Parker's portrayal of a drunk in the movie? I thought it was overly goofy. A bit part, so no big deal at the end of the day. I still found the movie very enjoyable (though somewhat unmemorable).",0
2293,"Also, I've heard some criticisms of Jennifer Lawrence's accent - but to me Charlotte Rampling's was much more egregious. When she initially appeared, I thought she was in fact playing a Brit who for whatever reason was working with the Russians. But then she started rolling her r's - sort of. m a g i c  p u s s y I don't know why people are calling this film a ""snooze fest"" outside of the fact that maybe they were expecting something more action-packed.",0
2294,"For what it is, it's great. Visually, it's amazing. Some people are calling the sex scenes superfluous and also saying it's too gory. I don't see that. There is sex and gore, but it's not too overwhelming that it distracts from the actual story. I'm not sure why so many people hate on this movie. The accents may have been lacking, and maybe it was a bit predictable due to the entire 'american movie involving a usa-vs-russia plot', but what movies of its kind aren't?",0
2295,"I checked some reviews, and apparently some people went into this expecting some sort of Fast&Furious style action bullshit? Really? Wow.",0
2296,"I loved the suspense. I loved the interaction. The beauty of this one was in the subtlety. Anyone can guess sort of how it will end (again, usa-vs-russia in an american movie ...), so it is the route to get there that matters.. and it was suspenseful every bit of the way.",0
2297,"It is one of few movies I consider excellent. There wasn't too much nudity. There wasn't too little. Same with blood, gore and death. Every single instance of blood & sex emphasized exactly how large the stakes were. Any single instance of these in this movie is worth more than a hundred deaths or romance scenes in many other movies.",0
2298,"It was a wonderful, albeit somewhat predictable journey. Was I the only one that found the torture and rape seems a bit gratuitous? For the most part they didnt add to the story and just prolonged a movie that was already considerably lengthy.  I don't think this movie will be received well by people who didn't read the novel. I mean, I'm not trying to be elitist or anything, but the articles I saw mentioning it leading up to release seem to think it's a very different thing than I would expect having read the novel. When I saw people calling it ""Black Widow"" I knew they were expecting something the novel never really promised, and after finally watching it I got about what I expected. ",0
2299,"Overall the movie paid off on the general feel of what the novel was going for pretty well-- it was a Le Carrean spy thriller built around a subversive ""Bond Girl."" It actually did things a little better by merging Marta and ""Swan,"" (Swan was admittedly a small part of both the novel and movie, yet Mary Louise-Parker still felt the most synonymous with her book counterpart to me) and having Dominika set up Vanya as the mole instead of actually giving up Marble. Of course, doing it that way kind of creates an impossible divergence from the source material if they're going to follow up with the rest of Matthews books. ",0
2300,"Anyone expecting another *Salt* or *Atomic Blonde*, will walk out disappointed, but if you're prepared for something more methodical I'd say it's a 7/10.  People love to complain and pick at everything. I liked it. 8/8 m8 [deleted]",0
2301,"I don't think Jim Parsons or Kristin Dunst were really the antagonists. I don't think anybody was really the antagonist. In spite of that, though, it's remarkable how *oppressive* the atmosphere felt.",1
2302,"Late in the movie, when Katherine is running across the campus, I was pretty keyed in to the urgency of the moment. Millions of dollars and the life of John Glenn was on the line, and not to mention the reputation of NASA and of the American space program in general in the context of the cold war. She's her ass off half a mile away, in heels, to do her duty. And when she's here and hands the book off to verify her calculations, she's won a small victory.....and then the door closes right in her face.",1
2303,"I felt the oppression there. The frustration that comes with being able to do everything right, yet nobody will care. She then quietly composes herself and realizes ""her place,"" and my heart broke.",1
2304,"Spencer's character at the library just trying to find the right book, one which is not in the colored section. Monae's character being reminded that the colored seats are in the back of the court room. And later ""noticing"" that there are no colored seats in her class. Katherine running across campus just to find a bathroom that she is allowed to use and never once complaining about it until she is publicly berated about her use of time. Kevin Costner appearing to be a generally good person who doesn't care about race, and yet still never even thought about the difficulty of being forced into a certain bathroom half a mile away.",1
2305,"This movie certainly has its problems. I won't disagree with many of them. But I just don't care. As a white male, it's hard for me to really appreciate how pervasive this kind of oppression can be. It sits above you, looming over every interaction. For the first time I think I finally have a small glimpse of true understanding. And for that, I really appreciate the movie.   Here is the comparison between truth and the movie:",1
2306,http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/hidden-figures/,1
2307,To summarize:,1
2308,1) All major white characters except the astronauts are either composites or fictional.,1
2309,"2) Several major career events in the black characters lifes are shifted by years.  For example, Vaughn became the first black supervisor in 1948.  This made the movie more dramatic but NASA look more racist. It's much better than I was expecting as a biography, especially when you learn that all three of the history-making main characters actually worked together, and I appreciated the look into the world of the space race when it was first starting out.",1
2310,"I liked how it portrayed math nerdiness, and while the commentary on prejudice was on the nose, it was also accurate. Shit was ugly then, and discrimination took many forms, and it wasn't ""pandering"" to the topics at all. ",1
2311,It was an entertaining movie that derived drama from the historic work done by historic character in oppressive times.,1
2312,"PS: why does this post not get a sticky compared to the other two? That scene where Kevin Costner bashed down the ladies restroom sign was definitely the most powerful moment in the film for me. I'm glad that although racism and segregation was rampant during that time, there were still many others out there who were like ""come on fam, let's just get shit done."" I went to see today at the matinee. I was surprised at how full the theater was. I liked it and so the rest of the audience, as far as I could tell. Everyone laughed at all the right moments and such. The acting in this movie was really good, and the story told is fascinating and worth telling. The movie has a couple of powerful scenes, I especially like [the scene in the bathroom, when Kirsten Dunst's character says ""I have nothing agains you all"", and Octavia Spencer ""I know you probably believe that"". Great writing, so much told in one short sentence.](#spoiler), but other than a couple of scenes, the movie is pretty much paint-by-numbers from start to finish.",1
2313,"Not that that's a bad thing, mind you, it's just that playing it safe doesn't make a great movie. Maybe I just needed a not depressing film right now but I couldn't hate Hidden Figures. Oh I know it's not perfect. The script is painfully on the nose, many of the white characters exist as strawmen, and the score sounds like Zimmer was asleep. However I think the acting (particularly from the three main lead women) and some strong scenes makes this a pretty solid watch. There's just some nice moments like the engagement scene or Mary Jackson in court. It's totally what you expect from this kind of movie but it never felt so pandering to me that I hated it. It's sort of a perfect movie to show high-school students. Something to teach people about important figures in history in a positive way. ",1
2314,I won't stand out on a limb for this film but I'd say it's at least a decent watch. If you hated it I totally get it but for me it was a nice surprise. Praise:,1
2315,"Fantastic acting from 3 leads (Octavia, Janelle & Taraji)",1
2316,Great story with a few powerful 1-liners ,1
2317,"The bathroom scenes, first meeting with CPL, car scene and IBM scenes were really good",1
2318,Feel good ending (is someone cutting onions in here?),1
2319,Criticisms: ,1
2320,Very 'PG'. ,1
2321,There weren't any real antagonists aside from (in hindsight) a broken/backwards society. ,1
2322,"It was a little ""hokey"". There are much more powerful on the topic.  It's interesting seeing all comments half-complaining that the racism and sexism wasn't shown more 'seriously'. It wasn't violent or in-your-face or dark and gritty - but it was *there*. At every step of the way it was there. They had to fight tooth and nail over and over and over and over just to get the same basic dignity afforded to their coworkers. And they did it with grace and poise - [aside from that one glorious rant Katherine got in](#spoiler). I may not have to deal with it on the level they've had, but as a woman and as a computer programmer, a lot of those micro aggressions hit home for me.",1
2323,"Overall the movie met and exceeded all of my expectations. The cinematography, pacing, costuming, acting, and (very few) vfx where on point. As for historical accuracy, I know they condensed timelines a bit and cut things down and combined characters to make it work on screen, but the core of the story was kept intact. The achievements of those women are 100% true and it was a joy to see it come to life on the screen.",1
2324,"10/10 - one of my favorite historical biopics I've ever seen. How many sticks of gum did Costner put in his mouth throughout this movie? But it was pretty good. Just could have done without the whole love story sub plot. It didn't really have much to do with the other three waaay more interesting stories. This was so much fun and it made me wish more biographical/historical dramas were comedy-dramas instead. I'd take this over *The Theory of Everything* any day, for instance. The humor humanized the three women so well and really made the film a celebration of their lives, as it should be. The wit/banter of all three characters was an effective way of *showing* their intellect (as opposed to the scenes of them solving math problems, which, to a clueless audience, is really just *telling*).",1
2325,"If she continues acting, Janelle Monae's going to be a star-- too bad this film wasn't made after her breakout performance in *Moonlight*, or she'd probably have been given a meatier arc. I also thought it was clever to cast two very well-known comedic actors, Kirsten Dunst and Jim Parsons, to play the (realistically nuanced) ""villains"". The best part about racists is rooting against racists and both actors did a good job of making their characters delightfully insufferable without becoming caricatures. ",1
2326,"I thought Taraji P. Henson was just fantastic, and it's a pity that she isn't getting much attention as a lead-- Octavia Spencer's performance, while good, was far less memorable. ",1
2327,"Also, is it fascinating or what that the events of this movie and *Loving* took place at the same time in the same state? Even though the core issue is the same, they feel so different. I really liked this movie.  Yes, it was extremely on the nose and seemed way too Hallmark and ooey gooey at times, but I knew it wasn't going to be a super challenging drama or anything.  So I just let myself enjoy it.  Sometimes it's nice to just relax into a feel good movie. Good movie but i did find it to be a bit hokey, a bit patronizing, and a bit overacted at times.  A bit too heavy on the facial acting to convey emotion for my taste A wonderfully told story, and an important one at that, but I felt that this was too Hollywood-ified vs. what the real history is. Also, the math that was on the big blackboards was laughably simplistic, almost to the point of being patronizing. [deleted] I hope this movie becomes one of those feel good classics that tv channels run when they want to fill a chunk of time. I remember that's how The Color Purple ended up being one of my favorite movies. ",1
2328,"That being said, this is definitely worth a watch. Go see it in theaters and get the experience of laughing, gasping, and crying with an audience. If anything this movie is very charming. ",1
2329,"Favorite scene is between Octavia Spence and Kirsten Dunst when they have a conversation in the bathroom. 1) Because Octavia Spencer has a last line that throws so much shade I could feel the sun eclipse and 2) It captures a very real side of racial tensions in a palatable way. It's played as a comedic moment but highlights a harsh reality and I think there's some skill in crafting those kinds of moments.  It definitely has that old-Hollywood feel-good sheen, but honestly considering the subject matter and where we are in American culture and race relations right now, I think that's exactly what it needed. I laughed, I cried, all three leads did a fantastic job, and the ""edits"" they made historically were actually much more mild than I expected. I also found a lot of the scenes from the trailer that I thought would be ridiculously cheesy were more subtle/believable in context. ",1
2330,"I'm a huge fan of Janelle Monae's music and artistry so it was awesome to see her hold her own in such a Star-studded movie! I really liked the movie overall. I think there were some problems here and there: maybe this is just me, but it kind of felt like since [they put Dorothy in charge of the computers and Katherine's big heroic moment occurred because the computers were wrong, to me it sort of made it seem like that only happened because Dorothy fucked up](#spoiler). Also it felt like they just sort of forgot to write and ending to Mary's arc. Maybe the ending was supposed to be[ that she started classes](#spoiler), but it felt left hanging to me, especially in comparison to the other two. ",1
2331,"That said, I still found the movie very good overall. I enjoyed all three leads, but I agree that Janelle Monae was the standout. Nice to see Mahershala Ali (who I remain convinced is roughly 85% teeth) and Janelle Monae together on screen again after Moonlight, even if only briefly. I a little bit had the thought of like ""Wow, I can't believe I'd never heard of these women"" followed quickly by ""Well.. actually I'd never heard of any of the men either.""",1
2332,Mostly irrelevant sidenote: I definitely did not know that Euler is pronounced like oy-ler. I always assumed it was yoo-ler. Educational movie! These women were truly amazing. Starting a car by poking the alternator with a screwdriver is downright magical. Was I the only one who kept seeing Sheldon?,1
2333,"Edit: I think the casting of Jim was great, though. I was surprised to not see a slide rule anywhere. Did I just miss it? I assume they would still be widely used at that time. My main issue with the movie is that it's too on the nose, it literally screams ""this movie is supposed to be inspiring"" at the audience. ",1
2334,That doesn't keep it from being good though! The alternative is to really dig into the racism/sexism that the women were facing in a more serious manner and that would have utterly changed the complexion of the movie.,1
2335,"The acting is good all around, Janelle Monae and Octavia Spencer do good work with the small roles they're given (it's really Taraji P Henson's movie). Kevin Costner is getting really good at the grizzled vet who lends gravitas to the ongoing affairs.",1
2336,"It's not going to displace any of my picks for the best of the year, but it's still a fine movie on a subject that hasn't been explored in movie to date. ",1

2351,"Love how this avoided so many obvious subplots and tropes - Ruben never has a relapse, he doesn't have a romance with his hot ASL teacher, his RV doesn't get robbed etc The sound mixing/editing deserves SO much attention this upcoming Oscar season holy shit. The shot of Ruben drumming on the metal slide while the little boy put his ear to it was fucking beautiful. I’m tearing up thinking about it. THAT LAST SCENE. That ending was so well done.  They didn’t harp on the break-up or basically that his life is now in shambles and he is homeless, yet it had such an impact in those final moments.  He got the implants to get back to his old life, thus destroying his new life, only to find his old life has moved on without him, and is left with essentially little to nothing. One thing I love about this movie is the lack of extreme plot twist. I’ve become so accustomed to thinking, “alright what shit is gonna happen next...” and it turns out? Nothing. And I really loved that. The center wasn’t fishy or suspicious, Lou never do anything out of line, and Ruben although stressed never had a crazy tantrum destroying anything outside of the trailer scene. ",1
2352,"The Sound of Metal is a great title as well. I just realized the title refers to both the music Ruben played and the sound his new implants gave him. The scene where Ruben returns after the implants and Joe has to tell him he can't stay was amazingly well done. The disappointment Joe feels, Ruben not really getting it... Just great acting. Just when you’re blown away by these performances, remember that both Cooke and Ahmed are British! Incredible accent work. Beautiful film. I don’t have so much an analysis but just wanted to share personally how much this movie struck a chord with me.",1
2353,"I played in a touring band and am into the same bands as Ruben (if his shirts are any indication) so that’s what initially compelled me to give it a watch, but was not at all expecting how much I would identify with his story.",1
2354,I am an addict who was in a long term relationship with a non-addict. I had an intervention via a relative and was essentially forced into rehab despite my wishes. My partner promised she would wait. That scene of Lou and Ruben standing at the cab broke me- because essentially same conversation happened to me.,1
2355,"After arriving at the rehab, fighting it, a couple of months go by and I eventually began to find my place & form deep bonds with the people in my facility. I was offered a job there to work with others dealing with their addiction. ",1
2356,"However, my primary goal was to get back into my relationship, get back to my band. “Save my life”",1
2357,"So against the advice of everyone in my program, I left. ",1
2358,"I returned and tried to revive my relationship, since I was now “fixed” . But we were on two totally separate life trajectories at that point. That open arm embrace upon my return that I had been fantasizing about was instead stifled, awkward. We just didn’t jive anymore. Our breakup looked the same too, through tears and solemn acceptance.",1
2359,My sobriety ultimately failed- and I can’t help but wonder if it’s in part because I prioritized the wrong things at the time.,1
2360,"So yeah, wonderful movie. Makes me really love and appreciate the power of film. Feels weird getting so personal on this sub, but if you read this, thanks. The scene where Joe is telling Ruben he can’t stay with the group anymore; specifically when Ruben is anxiously explaining why he needs money, and Joe tells him he is acting like an addict was incredibly well done by both actors. The mix of disappointment/sadness but softness from Paul Raci, and the frustration and inner turmoil from Riz is done perfectly. A scene that will stick with me for a while. Is that really what it sounds like for people with implants? I naively assumed it would be like audio feed of normal sound. Not the crackling static. Genuinely laughed out loud when Ruben was drawing the naked lady for Jenn.  ",1

2363,"Amazing film, very powerful! Brilliant movie. Amazing performance. A lot of people think Oldman will win his second this year but I'm really rooting for Ahmed to win his first. Anyone else notice how when Ruben starts working on the roof and Joe says not to, it’s because “it doesn’t need fixing” just like his deafness doesn’t need fixing? Thought it was a cool little detail Just watched it. My cousin's wife, who recommended it,  has cochlear implants.  She can't really understand music thru the implants, either.",1
2364,"I don't think this movie is really about just deafness specifically.  It's about loss.  Ruben spends the whole movie trying to get his old life back. The airstream, the gig life, the metal, the girl.  And he can't, because none of it is the same after. He rejected the deaf commune because it required him to cut ties with the hearing world, and everyone in it. He wants his old life back, that's the goal.",1
2365,"In the end, he has that moment of acceptance. Of course he's not throwing away the implant forever, he's just cutting off the sounds when it gets overwhelming. He gets his moment of stillness, when he accepts that everything has changed and he can finally move forward. He has nothing, but he's finally free. [deleted] The scene where Ruben is listening to Lou and her dad's song and the sound fades into what he's actually hearing... Amazing. This is one of those movies that really scares me and it's heartbreaking. ",1
2366,It really was a rollercoaster of emotions. ,1
2367,"I found it funny that Matthew Amalric is in this movie when he had another which evoked similar feelings, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. Movies were the main character goes through a medical ordeal in this way always unsettle me.",1
2368,"It definitely is Top 5 for me this year. Am I the only one who kept on lowering their volume as the movie progressed? Lost of hearing is one of the most frightening that could happen to someone. I guess people choose to view this film differently. There are some that choose to interpret the moments more reassuringly as acceptance. I thought the ending was incredibly sad. Absolute silence being better than the ringing noise that he spent 40-60 grand on is an incredibly sad position to be in, and the film made me realize how devastating it would be to never be able to hear for the rest of your life. Man... I cried for 10 minutes after that last scene cut to black. One of the most beautiful and powerful closing shots I’ve experienced in a long time. This film was truly an astounding accomplishment. Cinema at its absolute purest. Loved it. Movies about drummers seem to stick... Whiplash and now Sound of Metal. This movie broke me down. The break up/acceptance scene at the end finally did me in. Beautiful film. And Riz Ahmed deserves an Oscar nomination. Easily best movie of the year. It better win best sound editing and mixing at the Oscars this year. Can't think of better use of sound in a movie.",1
2369,"Okay but heart fucking broke when I saw Bruno’s table setting. That has to be the most quietly heartbreaking things I’ve ever seen in a Disney movie. ""We Don't Talk About Bruno."" Proceeds to have the best musical number in the film about Bruno. So the cousin can't keep a secret for 5min at dinner but has been hearing Bruno in the walls for how many years and never bothered to mention it..? mirabel’s gift being bringing her family to reality was such a great peaceful resolution, but i really wish we saw what kind of room casita built for her! after all that work repairing generational trauma she deserves all",0
2370,"the sewing machines and skeins of yarn she wants. I just want to mention the yellow butterflies. They are an iconic piece of One Hundred Years of Solitude that have become a symbol for Colombia and magical realism, meaning the occurrence of life and joy in the middle of grim circumstances. I had a big smile when one of them showed up in the river by the end of the movie, it was kind of the same story told once again.",0
2371,"But the first time we saw a yellow butterfly was when they show Mariano in love with Isabela, resembling Mauricio Babilonia’s character in the book, who was always followed by yellow butterflies when in love.",0
2372,"Edit: my first award! Thank u! They really, really captured Colombia. Down to the father saying ""miercoles"" as a euphemism. The entire time the family was singing “We Don’t Talk About Bruno,"" all I could think of was, “Silenzio, Bruno!” Crossover universe between Luca and Encanto confirmed. I haven't seen it posted already so I'll just comment this: Mirabel's skirt/dress is beautifully animated, and it really popped to me during The Family Madrigal. Can't wait to see this again, probably in 3D this time. I loved this movie. Surface Pressure was definitely my favorite song. Bawled like a bitch throughout the movie. I was happy that there was no real villan. Its true the grandma was a huge fuckin asshole, but I wouldnt classify her as a villain. Just a dick. And once she had her eyes opened to how her dick behavior had negatively impacted her family, she changed. I do wish she had a more over time transition though. Kinda seems like she just got slapped in the face with the consequences of her actions and then was like ""oh shit what have I done"" and that was that. Otherwise, I had a great time seeing it and Ill prolly get it on dvd when its out So, I don't know if I'm crazy here, but everything on the internet is stating that there is ""no physical antagonist"" in this movie and that the antagonist is more thematic in terms of ""generational trauma"" but....Abuela Alma is like, ABSOLUTELY the antagonist here right?  Like, just because she learns her lesson doesn't make her behavior less downright toxic to the other members of her family for a healthy chunk of the movie... Just saw it, loved it. Some observations:",0
2373,"- The shape-shifting cousin had chameleons on his poncho. I didn't notice this til the end, but what a nice detail.",0
2374,- Of course Bruno's visions are glass panes. What is glass made of? Sand.,0
2375,"- Recognized Abuela's voice from In The Heights immediately, which was cool. Didn't realize til afterwards that Mirabel was in the movie version as well.",0
2376,- All the musical sequences. I'm a slut for musical sequences in animation and these were all incredible. We Don't Talk About Bruno is of course the stand-out one. Can't wait til that's on Youtube to rewatch it and soak in more of the animation details.,0
2377,"- Speaking of Bruno, I did think his character design looked a little young, which was kind of odd? I remember seeing shots of him in one of the trailers a few weeks ago and thinking ""okay, that guy's gotta be our love interest character"". Oops. My family and I have been singing ""We Don't Talk About Bruno"" nonstop since last night.",0
2378,"Such an earworm. Question, Mirabel was basically ostracized because she didn’t have a gift and in her Abuela’s eyes could not help their community. But who the hell was Camilo helping with his gift? How can shapeshifting really help anyone? Honestly, I really loved it which is why it's shortcomings were so pronounced to me. The visuals were gorgeous, and the notion of having it set essentially in one house is a concept that I loved. The powers were all very cute and interesting. But the plot pacing was so, so strange. One major instance I can remember was >!the fight between the main character and the grandma!<. I feel like that should have happened halfway through the movie, but it happened like 85% in - it was resolved essentially immediately after. Or how >!the sisters can't stand each other, but after a short song they are completely in sync!<. The begining and end felt so brief, but the middle was really long. Don't get me wrong, it was the best part of the movie, but the pacing was really not doing it for me. I also felt that the music was tired and really unremarkable. The songs didn't push the plot forward much and felt like a desperate attempt to reach the top 10 charts. I know it's to be expected at this point, but it still was upsetting to hear. I can't remember a single song - even if you played it to me, I wouldn't be able to tell you it was in the movie. Bruno is a perfect character Kinda gets easily overlooked but can we appreciate the fact they actually had people of different skin tones in the family instead of easily making everyone white or the same tone. Accurate for Colombia. Did anyone else feel Pepa (aunty tied to the weather) was a subtle representation of mental illness? It seemed she always had clouds and was battling her anxiety throughout. I quite liked that it wasn't made into a big deal - it was (and is) just part of life. I realized something while watching this movie and it’s that I’m not a fan of how Disney animated their musical numbers anymore because of how many cutaways they have to something that doesn’t exist. Old Disney movies used to use songs to broaden the world. For example, One Jump Ahead in Aladdin making the streets of Agrabah come alive, A Girl Worth Fighting For from Mulan showing the Chinese countryside and the citizens that the army was protecting. The Circle of Life is probably the best example of this, showing us just how impressive the lions rule over the pride lands is and setting the stage perfectly for the rest of the movie.",0
2379,"Meanwhile, in modern Disney movies half of the songs don’t even take place in the setting they’re being sung in, characters are transported off to mystical dreamscapes where they fall through clouds and interact with metaphorical representations of what they’re singing about. See: You’re Welcome in Moana, Summer in Frozen, and Surface Pressure in Encanto. I dunno, I feel like it makes the world feel more shallow and thin for a few quick gags Lin Manuel Miranda's songwriting is so tied to his singing voice that I honestly couldn't listen to any of the songs in this movie without hearing his voice in the back of my head. What is happening at Disney? All their films recently feel like messes. Full of great ideas, great characters, beautiful imagery - but meandering stories struggling to link these things together. Is the plot an afterthought in development? I’m colombian, this movie was amazing. the fact that the family was displaced by violence is not something id ever see in a disney movie. Colombia has been in one conflict or another for like 100 years and most of the books that come out of Colombia are heavily related to that, is unfortunately, a huge part of what Colombia is. ",0
2380,"Also, i felt that the ashes were a reference to Armero, but that might be a stretch. ",0
2381,"Overall I’m severely pleasantly surprised, this was beyond my expectations and we’ll see it a few more times ",0
2382,"My fav song was dos orugas, tho it felt just so relatable because of my recent breakup. The grandmother scene where she explains her origins was just heartbreakingly beautiful. Not a dry eye in my theater i realized: does abuela have a gift? her central role is to act as the leader of the family without any additional assistance of magic guiding everyone else in her influence. if anything then mirabel wasn’t the first one to not be granted a direct power. she as herself is enough to lead others with love - she takes after her grandmother in this regard. her grandmother puts so much of their family’s success squarely on the magic thinking of herself as  not enough to take care of everyone depending on her without the magic. as much as the movie is about mirabel understanding she is enough the grandmother is enough as well. they are both worthy of the love of others without condition. This… wasn’t a good movie, it was ok at best.  It looked great, but the story and songs were just all off.  Nobody is going to be singing these songs like any of the 90s Disney classics. It's so beautiful to see my country represented like this, specially the Donkeycorn",0
2383,"Nyles: ""So this is your life?""",0
2384,"Roy: ""Not bad, huh? Beautiful wife, beautiful kids... little Joey is watering dog shit."" Oh man this was such a great film. It has a perfect balance between the typical Romantic Comedy, and a SciFi film. I was nervous they’d end it with an ambiguous ending on wether they got out, but it’s one of those few movies where I’m glad we got the happy ending. I love Roy's reaction when he realized Sarah's plan worked.",0
2385,"Anyway, I just think it is a pretty fitting romcom to watch right now in the situation like this when we feel like yesterday is today, today is today, and tomorrow is today. Did the Grandma get out? “It’s not good wine” every wedding bartender ever Good movie in general but great quarantine movie when days start to feel the same. Although it does make me want to start drinking at 9 in the morning. The “let’s waste some time” montage was just so fucking perfect. All I could think about was how shitty it would have been if Roy went to sleep before seeing Sarah's message lol Cristin Milioti has a knack for meshing with everyone on screen, she’s just extremely charming.  But man...her and samburg were next level perfect.  Chemistry out the wazoo. Great movie. I love that they included a scene at the end to show that they told Roy. I was really worried the movie would just forget about him after his resolution with Nyles. To say this movie was needed right now is a vast understatement. This film was such a fucking delight from start to finish. ",0
2386,"One of the many things I have to praise the film for is just how well paced the first 20 minutes are. You get Nyles and his problems all laid out just in the opening scene alone, him having everything planned out even before the inevitable time loop reveal (the dance at the wedding was pretty obvious toward that), trying to get at Sarah with his casual wedding toast which leads to them hooking up, and when she jumps into the time loop and enters “the next day”, it’s so well edited from both of their POV’s, I kept smiling the whole way through as to just how on point the whole opening felt. Very rare for comedies to have that kind of pacing.",0
2387,Samberg and Milioti have such remarkable chemistry between each other that it didn’t feel like a chore to sit through when this whole concept has been done countless times. ,0
2388,"The movie did a lot of stuff that felt refreshing and unique, but the two scenes that stood out to me were after Sarah runs over Roy and Nyles explains to Sarah that they can still feel pain leading up to one of the twists. It made you sympathize with both of them because you would have to get to a point to be where Sarah is at in being stuck in that time-loop for god knows how long and Nyles having already felt those feelings numerous times. ",0
2389,"The second scene being Roy and Nyles having their heart to heart at Roy’s house. It’s a scene not a lot of screenwriters would add, but because they did, it gave them so much emotional heft as to what they have both been going through and having that understanding of the struggles of being stuck in the time-loop forever. A comedy made me feel that existential reality!",0
2390,"This is hands down one of my favorite movies of the year, even if all of the releases were to have come out if the ‘Rona didn’t happen, still would’ve been in my Top 10 of the Year!",0
2391,"The only thing that sucks is not being able to experience this in a theater with a packed crowd, so many of the jokes would’ve killed in a theater... I just miss watching movies in a theater, especially comedies. Well that was super fun! Had some really good gags, I loved the bomb in the cake. Maybe I am alone in this, but for *Palm Springs*, *Russian Doll* and *Groundhog Day*, I feel like I would happily watch an extended cut with even more nihilistic time loop shenanigans without getting bored at all. I understand why it has to be done in a snappy montage since hijacking planes or learning silly dance routines does not advance the story, but it's such a fun premise to watch actors play around in. [deleted] Cristin Milioti’s role in this reminded me a lot of her role in Black Mirror’s USS Callister. I wonder if the director casted her because of that. Excellent film, loved every second of it. >*Your best bet is to learn to suffer existence*",0
2392,"This line, man. This line. Naming him Nyles when his entire persona is based on Nihilism is just so clever. This is a brilliant movie, actually somehow has a fairly unique take on the whole time loop idea. ",0
2393,"Works so much better having Niles have already been in it for ages before he's joined by someone new. Basically got the best of both worlds when it came to skipping over the ""lets try this to get out"" but still get a couple of good gags in there like the suicide.",0
2394,Glad they managed to get a message to Roy at the end too.,0
2395," Though I think the new husband is a total scumbag, snorting lines on his wedding day and cheating on his wife who was saving herself for marriage with her sister...what are we supposed to think he's actually going to be a good husband now? He did literally nothing redeeming the whole movie...",0
2396,"""One of those Shaggy Dogs"" was a great last line though.",0
2397,Also the granny was totally in the loop right? Please tell me someone else caught that? >After Credits Scene? No,0
2398,"/u/mi-16evil there is a mid-credits scene Okay okay okay. Is Sara's grandma stuck in the time loop?? She has that throwaway line about her mom also dying when she was young, and then she says good luck - Sara will need it. This is different to what she says to Niles when he gives a great speech. Is she in the loop?? Does she know? Thoughts??? I'm a big fan of Andy Samberg and The Lonely Islamd in general, but going into this I had no idea of the premise whatsoever. Only knew it was a Romcom with sci-fi elements.",0
2399,When I realized they were pulling a Groundhog Day I was expecting disappointment.,0
2400,"Somehow, they not only pulled it off, but completely nailed it. I love that they kept some of the silliness and ridiculousness that are Lonely Island hallmarks, but found a way to create almost an arthouse version of it. Just watched it with my Wife and we both very much enjoyed it. I had no idea at all what it was about and that really helped, people need to see it blind.",0
2401,"Will it come to bluray eventually? Would love to own a copy. I just never get sick of timeloop stories. This one is a nice addition to that genre. ""Guess they come back November 10th."" ",0
2402,"HA! Good movie, hit me with some really specific feelings.",0
2403,So Roy had the option of leaving the loop for his own timeline where Sarah and Nyles never knew him. I guess that means they went to a world where he doesn't know them. I wonder if they got together under normal circumstances?,0
2404,"Yeah, the grandmother was 100% in the loop too. She'd already achieved her bliss, spending time with her family. Makes her compliment to Nyles there at the beginning really genuine. ",0
2405,The bartender was great. Seems like she has her own weird thing going on. I guess other people like her could've been in the loop too in other timelines.,0
2406,"I noticed when they all showed up to the festival, the elder who greeted them turned to each of the 3 males in the group and said ""Welcome"", but when he turned to Dani he said ""Welcome home"" im guessing that pelle's parents sacraficed themselves in the yellow house and that's how they died? and that's why his brother did it? they have a queen and a yellow house burns down every summer right or just every 90 years that part was unclear to me Somebody please tell me if I'm looking too much into it, but...",0
2407,"I thought it was interesting that Pelle described life as 4 seasons, with spring being birth/childhood and winter being old age/death. If I'm not wrong, the movie begins in winter with the death of her family and the midsommar festival takes place at the end of spring, yes? Is this supposed to be... rebirth into her new ""family""? I dunno.",0
2408,"Edit: yeah so it definitely is summer by the time of the festival I guess. For some reason I thought somebody said it ended on the summer solstice. There was a lot of stuff to pay attention to, I got distracted lol. The only hereditary-esque moment for me where I just felt like I was being gripped by something awful was the beginning when we see suddenly see what has become of Dani's family. Suicide tends to really emotionally get to me and that scene made me cry in the theater, just the sheer weight of realization and emotions of people you care about being erased. I know a lot of people are praising its cinematography, but I gotta give a shout-out to the sound design team. Very little ambient sounds - lots of scenes almost feel like people are talking in a vacuum.",0
2409,And then ambience picks up again when they trip. Something I bet a lot of folks may not notice but a subconsciously effective way of inciting general unease.,0
2410,"EDIT: Another thing I forgot to mention was that because of the intentionally minimalistic sound design/mixing combined with using multiple channels for dialogue in a lot of scenes, whenever i heard whispering I’d freak out - only to realize it was a couple or whomever whispering to each other in the theater. I really want to go back and look at all the paintings in Dani’s apartment. Pelle to Christian in the beginning - “Think of all Swedish women you can impregnate in June.” 😳 I couldn’t help but notice the amount of long shots in that movie that must have been very difficult to film. ",0
2411,"One that really stood out to me was the one dinner scene where the two elders sit down and then everyone synchronized picks up their utensils one by one in this sweeping overhead shot of the table. That shot felt like porn to me. I'm losing movie recommendation privilege for a few weeks with my wife as a result of this one. This was the weirdest possible movie for an Austin Powers namedrop Dancing Queen would have been a neat choice for the credits. I’ve never seen Florence Pugh in anything before, but holy shit she is so good in this. It’s been said a million times already I’m sure, but she made me feel her pain and grief so deeply. That first scene where she trips and has a panic attack after Will (who is also phenomenal in his role) mentions family broke my heart and made me so anxious. I’m seriously impressed by this film as a whole, but her role especially. I felt so sorry for her. Honestly, I’ve never seen a more realistic depiction of psychedelics in a movie. I felt high just from watching it. Does anyone else have a take on the mirror motif? There are at least half a dozen shots where characters are framed through their reflection in a mirror. They're always looking at someone else -- which could be interpreted as a failure to introspect. When Christian is inside the bear at the end, they say something to the effect of ""reflect on your wickedness."" The exception to this being during Dani's bad trip, when seeing her own reflection snaps her out of it.",0
2412,There's also the psychological concept of [mirroring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirroring_\(psychology\)) -- something the Harga do to empathize with and comfort one another.,0
2413,"I saw Christian's major flaw as refusing to believe Dani. He is chronically unsupportive and challenges Dani every chance he gets. The Harga, on the other hand, are empathetic to the extreme. When Dani is crying on the floor of the cabin with the women surrounding her, they are quite literally *mirroring* her pain. I think for the first time, Dani sees herself in another person. And the events that follow make perfect sense.",0
2414,"TL;DR mirrors are a metaphor for empathy One of my favorite parts was in the prologue during Dani and Christian’s argument about his plans to leave for the festival. Just seeing him turn the argument around on her and making her force an apology and a plea to stay was really well done, and it showed the relationship’s dependency issues in a way that didn’t feel too in your face. My favorite moment is during the final scene when the building is burning and Pelle’s brother has the faintest look of doubt. Genuinely chilling. This movie takes post-nut clarity to a whole new level. Best match cut in a movie (Dani running into the apartment bathroom which cuts to the airplane bathroom) I've seen in quite some time. Well done. After now seeing Florence Pugh and Toni Collette’s absolutely guttural howls of despair, I am convinced Ari Aster is the master of directing realistic, gut-wrenching grief. Did anyone else’s theater lose its shit when the lady started singing into Christians hand during the sex scene and he’s just looking at her [like](https://media1.tenor.com/images/fbd3104bd1edd2462920ce542c1a561d/tenor.gif?itemid=9909518) Ultimately, I think the movie is about the importance of sharing grief with family and friends who care about you. The scene with the other women all mirroring the main character crying is a great visual representation of the message as they all try to feel her pain to help her heal. Anyone else like this movie, but confused to the degree they like it? I don't know if I'd buy it, see it again even, and would have to be extremely selective about who I recommend it to, but I still liked it. ",0
2415,"I think it's interesting that both this and Hereditary end with the cults winning- maybe that isn't the right word, but our protagonists certainly don't come out on top in either film. Did anybody else notice any faces in the trees in the background? I swear i kept seeing stuff. This is a great example of what a director, editor and score can do for a film. If you read the screenplay it comes off a lot scarier and darker. The final cut the entire film felt like a fairytale even with all the gore. There wasn't any judgement and the cult wasn't made to look evil at all. The most jarring thing about the cult was them juxtaposed with all the outsiders. The score is happily chugging along and victoriously celebrating the rituals while the main characters are just there inevitably perishing. There was no big realization by the characters that evil was coming from them. They just experienced Midsommar. Does anyone think there was any significance to the baby that kept crying while everyone was trying to sleep ?",0
2416,"Agree 100%, didn't know what to expect but watched it because Tom Felton was in it and was curios... Very good flick! Thanks, ill check it out I agree! It's a very unique war movie and I highly recommend. Thanks for the rec, just added it to my list. I thought it was alright. It's a masterpiece by Dutch movie standards, lol. It just doesn't really stand out among so many WWII movies. Just watched. A+++ excellent I gave up about half way through it. It was nothing more than WWII Movie 101. Is it true that the film replaces Canadians with British soldiers? This movie is somewhere between very meh and bad. Any recs from you or anyone else? Kinda new to the movies side, I've only watched docs. But I watched Dunkirk and now this and I really enjoyed both bc of how immersive I found them. That's more or less what I want from a WW2 movie, just ""put me there"" in a way? Make me feel at least a small bit of what it might've been like to actually be there",0
2417,"This particular movie was interesting bc it showed the perspective of people who were living under Nazi rule, which was neat 👍 There’s both British and Canadians Thanks for your opinion If you haven't seen it yet, Saving Private Ryan is one of the best WWII films of all time.  Also Band of Brothers is an amazing series following Easy Company through pretty much all of the European campaign Looked cheap, bad general writing, very approximative on military details. 👍 Why are you mad that I'm disagreeing with you? Did you make the movie yourself? I’m not mad man lol I’m just acknowledging your responses to my post and comment. Would you rather I not respond?",0
2418,"I really enjoyed it. Don't get the hate. I noticed a lot of the mannerisms that characters made when they were caught lying and I think it would be fun to watch it a second time and look for more.  I like to think that Willem Dafoe' s character showed up to the gig doing the accent and no one else knew he was gonna be doing it. One plot point I completely missed, why did Johnny Depp's character kill the child? I just got back from this. I liked it. But I didn't enjoy it the way I feel whodunnits should be enjoyed. I wasn't invested. I was never trying to figure out who did it. I was just watching and not observing. I enjoyed the performances and it was shot really well.  Did anyone else wonder if the person whose seat Poirot took (remember he got a place on the train because someone didn't show up) was supposed to be in on the murder? I kept waiting for that to be the last clue.  Two specific shots stood out to me.",0
2419,"The first when Poirot boarded the train, and then walked to his room. Wonderful introduction to the setting and a nice way to show you the layout of the train.",0
2420,"The second was the top-down view when the body is discovered. Like the other, this was made to look like a single shot if I am remembering correctly.",0
2421,Both these were really great. Maybe I'm reading into the movie a little bit but it seemed to me the scene with the uneven eggs and Poirot's willingness to accept it nicely foreshadowed the ending of the film.,0
2422,"""I do not blame you, I blame the hen."" The main thing I got from this movie is I'd love to go on a classy train ride like that.   So Poirot never even reaches London to solve the original case, and then takes another in Egypt? One thing at a time, man. [There was a polite collective chuckle of acknowledgment in my theater when the messenger told Poirot there had been a death on the Nile.](#spoiler)  Johnny Depp’s casting is perfect. What was the exact dialogue when Poirot first catches Mulqueen?? He says something like ""whats the american word for????"" Then he shouts FUDGE!!!  Did I really just sit through a whole movie thinking Ewan McGregor was playing the lead the whole time I wasn’t a fan of Branagh’s direction for Thor, but I appreciated a lot of the camera flourishes here - the top down-perspective of Depp’s cabin, the not that subtle split-glass face shot of Dafoe, the long tracking shot as Poirot first boards the train. Good stuff. ",0
2423,"The real star of the movie is the sleeping protector for the mustache. I wasn’t sure if they’d switch up the ending, but the staging of the final summation was a great scene - especially the victim’s-eye view of the murder.  I enjoyed this film a lot. Made me want to go back and watch the original! The cinematography was quite good, but I do believe the star of the show was (as usual with this guy) Branagh himself. I felt like his Poirot was a ton of fun. I enjoyed his performance so much. I think part of the charm was that in a film where the rest of the characters were played so straight and serious most of the time, down to earth as it were, Poirot's larger than life personality was charming and energetic. And, importantly, it was not so overblown that it was jarring or overly unbelievable. For those who don't love slow mysteries as much as myself, I think it will be little draggy in the middle, but, as someone who has a soft spot for any kind of murder mystery, I loved it. ",0
2424, I enjoyed it but there was something off about it. I kinda felt like the Armstrong story came out of nowhere and then it was barely explained at first.  How can Poirot sleep next to a cabin where [12 persons come and go and he doesnt hear them?](#spoiler) when you consider he doesnt seem in a deep stage of sleep (he woke up prior to that) Should have left out the detective's dead lover (added nothing to the story). I feel like perhaps subtracting two characters (like Marquez) would have allowed for a better character story. A lot of people seemed confused about who Linda Harden was in the theater listening to comments after.,0
2425,"Average film that should have been more given the cast. It looked beautiful, the cast was great, but ultimately I found it underwhelming.  The score was especially lacking. ",0
2426,"Brannagh embraces the character of Poirot (and that mustache!) but with so many characters and less than two hours to tell the story, instead of a heavy focus on a couple people just about everyone got not quite enough screentime.",0
2427,"Overall I'd say if you're a fan of the genre, check it out, but there are better versions of this story out there. Overall a very enjoyable film! I came in expecting a murder mystery And thats what I got! Although I will say I wish it had more clues for the audience to find. We kept getting details as the plot progressed. I didn’t really feel like there were hints for the audience to look back at and go, “ooooh, I can’t believe I missed that!”",0
2428,"I also felt that the ending’s culprit, (spoiler all of them) was very weird, but when Poirot did his monologue while walking through the train about people loosing their ways and how one crime had turned into many, I came to terms with it.",0
2429,"Overall, I enjoyed what I saw, especially since movies like this, a classic whodunnit are very few and far now a days... How's Daisy Ridley? Had to leave my theater 10 minutes into the second act because some snot-nosed kid pulled the fire alarm at my theater. I'll be back tomorrow after I see the rest! To the people complaining about the plot, this is typical Christie - Poirot's 'methods' are 90% guesswork which he calls 'the little gray cells', there's very little actual deduction in her books either.",0
2430,"e.g. one character says she teaches geography, another makes some vague reference, so of course the 2 must be the same person, never mind the incredible odds. This kind of stupidity is there in the stories as well.",0
2431,"The movie is good for what it was - great visuals,  set pieces and CGI. And the music in the 3rd act is incredible, that for me was almost worth it.",0
2432,"In the end, there will only be one David Suchet, the rest are pretenders. But I'm glad films like this still get made. It made me sad to go for a 9.30pm show and the theater was completely empty (there were only 3 people including me!) in a major metro area. Personally I thought this was one of the worst movies of the year and Branagh completely butchered the story with his disregard for the genre. My biggest gripe is that it is poorly paced and doesn't do any of the detective work that is to be expected of a story like this. As many people have noted, the film wastes too much time focusing on irrelevant points and shoehorns too many things (like an ill-conceived racial commentary and a random chase scene in the snow lol). It completely forgets that you have let the audience in so that any tension is build up with the audience trying to solve it as well or else its just a bare crime thriller. Characters are poorly introduced and developed, where some of them are just mindlessly neglected and only appear whenever they are needed. For example, the film is so lazy that it causally puts a montage scene for some of the characters despite the fact the audience should feel everyone is a suspect, but the film spends too much time on Daisy Ridley and Josh Gadd. ",0
2433,"The film really falls apart by the final third where it feels like Branagh is just rushing it with rapid-fire interrogation scene and the mystery is never let to simmer. Perhaps one of the most egregious part is where [Michelle Piffer's character gets stabbed (a change in the book) but the film never addresses this again and immediately cuts to the next scene despite being of vital importance. Similarly, where the doctor later shoots Poirot, the next scene is immediately the denouement without any consequences for the doctor](#spoiler). This has to be by far the worst denouement put on screen where there little flow and reasoning to how Poirot in this film got to his conclusions. Instead, it puts this bizzare moral thesis that is hard to believe given that the 'smartest detective in the world' surely isn't dumb enough to see the world as black and white... ",0
2434,"I immediately went to see the 1974 Lumet's version and fell in love with that. That is how it should be properly done with the mystery being the forefront and every character given the appropriate screen time. The 1974 manages to put the Armstrong side story at the forefront making it make a lot more sense in the context of the film which the 2017 version completely butchers. I love this genre of films and seriously hope more would be made (including a revised Sherlock Holmes), but this adaptation doesn't give me much hope unfortunately.  Johnny Depp was as Johnny Deppy as he always is, Kenneth Branagh's Mustache was fantastic as well and Daisy Ridley was good too... Overall a very enjoyable film.",0
2435,"I really enjoyed the movie, the first part of the movie felt like typical romcom, predictable but very comforting. And the second part, especially when the sisters argued, it felt really heavy and cathartic in a positive way.",0
2436,"The redemption part felt little bit rushed for me and I kinda wished Riley (Aubrey Plaza) arc got resolved. That being said I really like the chemistry of between her and Kristen Stewart, it was really charming. Also, I think Mackenzie Davies and Kristen Stewart chemistry was pretty good, especially in the beginning of the movie.",0
2437,"In the end, pretty refreshing romcom and I think Kristen Stewart should be in more romance and comedy movies.",0
2438,Side Note: ,0
2439,"* I saw [this photo](https://www.metroweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Happiest-Season-Photo-by-Lacey-Terrell-1.jpg) few months ago, and it showed up again on Tipper's instagram I assume that Riley is seeing someone new and Clea Duvall is portrayed her.",0
2440,"* I also like that Jane (Mary Holland) and John (Dan Levy) became BFF. I really enjoyed this movie. Great cast (including smaller cameo parts), and a lot of very funny moments mixed into a cute feel good story. Wanted to get that out of the way so that my minor complaints don’t come off as too negative. However...",0
2441,"I *hated* that Harper repeatedly left Abby alone at parties where she didn’t know anyone, or sent on outings with family members she’d just met, or ditched her to stay out late at a bar with her old friends. It made me so uncomfortable. Separately and independently from everything about her family issues and closetedness, she was just an inattentive partner and bad friend to Abby, who she’d brought into this very awkward and uncomfortable situation in the first place. I feel like they spent too much screen time showing her being a bad partner to strain their relationship and not enough showing why they were good together in a relationship to begin with. ",0
2442,"Also, Jane was very clearly the best member of that family from the start. The most heartbreaking moment wasn’t about any of the romantic or family relationships, it was when Jane’s absolutely beautiful painting got destroyed. And the most gratifying (albeit heavily telegraphed) moment was after the time jump when her novel was a bestseller. Dan Levy’s scene about coming out to your family was such an emotional scene. He stole any scene he was in. I just read [this article](https://www.indiewire.com/2020/11/happiest-season-clea-duvall-queer-rom-com-1234599465/)",0
2443,"> Late in the film, Harper’s sexuality is unmasked — without her consent — to her entire family, the kind of big revelation scene that has populated many a rom-com, but “Happiest Season” gives it a painful twist. Harper doesn’t use the moment to finally come out, but to pull herself deeper into the closet. It’s heartbreaking for Abby, and the kind of disruption to genre expectations that makes the film so special.",0
2444,"> “We all have our baggage, we all have our main triggers and our fight or flight responses, and I think Harper is someone who was like operating in this certain way for a long time,” DuVall said. “It’s this devastating moment where your instincts kick in and you realize that you have not come as far as you thought you have, because you haven’t really confronted yourself. It’s a very humbling moment and something that I think we can all relate to, no matter what it is we’re overcoming. You don’t overcome it on the first try.”",0
2445,"Yeah, this made me understand that reveal your queerness is not as easy as you think, especially when you can't predict their reaction",0
2446,"> As Abby flees from the scene, it’s John who catches up with her. Instead of tossing off some sassy witticisms, Levy’s character instead offers an emotional and introspective assessment of the situation, one that leans heavily on some necessary empathy.",0
2447,"> “I wrote this speech about coming out, because I was thinking about how we can have compassion for Harper in that moment,” DuVall said. “She does do something that is pretty bad and I can see why an audience would be upset with her, but it’s also about wanting to have compassion for people who are going through that. Coming out is so different for everybody. For some people, it’s super easy and I think that’s great for them, but for a lot of people, it’s really not.”",0
2448,"Yeah, glad that she gave Dan Levy (John) one of the most gut-punching moment in the movie, he really delivered on that. I think I’m too used to seeing Plaza in an evil/crazy role...I fully expected her to tell everyone they were lesbians. Glad she didn’t. I wish there was more of her in this film. ",0
2449,Also ,0
2450,"“Did you celebrate Christmas at the orphanage?” Yo... the closet is rough, I get that. But the closet doesn't make you ignore your girlfriend, spend all night with an ex, and then call her ""smothering"" when she calls you on it. The hell was this movie",0
2451,"Like, it sets up the premise like it's gonna be a lot of wacky misunderstandings, but all the conflicts and misunderstandings are not even remotely played like they're supposed to be funny. Weirdly dark movie, just weird all around. The movie suffered from making Harper too evil and the parents too nice. We're constantly told how horrible the dad is and I just didn't see it. He's not depicted as a good person, but if you want to justify Harper's awfulness, you needed to make the parents worse.  Also you can't have Harper be the favorite child, I feel like Harper's behavior would have been slightly more justifiable if the parents kept fawning over Allison Brie and ignoring Harper. ",0
2452,"I'm not the first person to say this, but this needed to be a braver movie where Harper and Abby just break up. A lot of Harper being a bad partner had little to do with her parents. Leaving Abby at all the parties, being jealous and hypocritical, etc.  ",0
2453,"If you have to end this movie with Harper and Abby together, cut out some moments of Harper being cruel to Abby, change the whole beginning to flesh out Harper and Abby and show why they are together, and have Allison Brie be the favorite child and not Harper. I really want to see the movie Kristen Stewart and Aubrey Plaza thought they were making I think the biggest problem is they didn't do enough to get people invested in Abby and Harper's relationship. All they get you to do is like Abby (you know, she doesn't like Christmas but is willing to put that aside, shes gonna propose) but then you spend over an hour watching her get dumped on by a never ending parade of shitty, toxic assholes. So you could give a rat's ass about them fixing their relationship, you'd rather just see Abby get the hell out of there. Then they rushed into trying to tie a little bow into redeeming this crappy family before it felt earned.",0
2454,I spent the entire back half of the movie hoping Kristen Stewart and Aubrey Plaza would run off together. Let them bond over what an asshole Harper is.,0
2455,"(But I liked Dan Levy) Personally wanted Abbey to get with Riley. Hated Harper and she didn't do enough to redeem her behaviour imo. Thought that family was terrible and felt so sorry for Jane. I'm so glad her book got published. “I have a way with routers” Overall I really enjoyed it but where they lost me was at the very end. There was so much toxic build up, Abby was hurt so much. If they wanted Abby and Harper to stay together, they should have at least did a small time jump...something like— Abby does leave and goes home. Stays with a friend and she runs back into Harper on NYE..",0
2456,We see Harper working things out with her parents before then and really digesting her behavior and how she fucked up. Then they agree to try again and we see them all happy and together again next Christmas. ,0
2457,"I did still feel for Harper, coming out can be so incredibly scary and painful as Levy’s character so aptly pointed out. But Harper needed some time to work on it instead of them just going “Oh cool, poof it’s all better now”. Thoughtful/constructive commentary aside, I just really liked the height difference between Kristen Stewart and Mackenzie Davis. Either Kristen is tinier than I've realised, or Mackenzie is basically an Amazon. I wonder if anyone (while filming) brought up the fact that they made Harper almost too unlikable in this. ",0
2458,"They kind of kept piling on reasons for people to dislike her. I can see why everyone was rooting for the Abby/Riley pairing, simply because Abby was consistently being hosed by the writers throughout the movie. This movie had the chance to be great and it blew it. It needed to make the bold move and it settled for the sappy ending instead.",0
2459,"Abbey deserved so much better and Harper was legit awful. I know it’s about her struggle feeling like she has to choose between her family or her girlfriend, but that’s just like... I don’t know.",0
2460,"Abbey should’ve ended up going home with John and starting over completely or she should have gotten with Riley. Harpers parents were straight up shitty people with no redeeming qualities and them suddenly being ok with everything at the end was absurd and also makes Harpers feeling extremely stupid, Harper was a selfish asshole too, she constantly treated Abby like shit and was completely oblivious to how her parents were treating her. Doesn’t matter if she’s terrified of her parents disowning her. Fuck them anyway they were extremely toxic and writhe with mental abuse. There's something about Christmas movies having the worst families, they were all terrible to each other. I loved the supporting cast and mostly had fun, but I think everyone in the family ended up a bit too unlikeable. Overall, not an awful way to spend a lazy Friday and better than a lot of the Christmas romcom garbage out there. This is one of the better Christmas movies in awhile in my opinion. Side note: is it bad that I wanted Kristen Stewart and Aubrey Plazas characters to get together instead? Can we get a sequel around the best characters, John (Dan Levy) Riley (Aubrey Plaza) and Jane (Mary Holland), the latter of whom deserved SO MUCH better? They can all wingman/wingwoman each other. ",0
2461,"Like it can be around Harper and Abby hosting Christmas or having a Christmas wedding, whatever. I liked it. And I feel like a lot of folks in this comment section are falling prey to that most Reddit of behaviours, looking at one bad time and suggesting someone throw their entire relationship out.",0
2462,"The opening picture montage tells us that Abby and Harper have been together, and happy, for over a year; Abby moved in six months ago, and things have gone so well she's planning to propose. Aside from a bit of awkwardness on their date, every indication is that this is a happy, functional couple. ",0
2463,"And then they visit Harper's family. After just a couple of days of being closeted and surrounded by toxic people Abby wants to get out of there, and who can blame her? These people suck! She's not at all wrong to leave that party, or to tell Harper it's over at that point. But Abby's feeling punchy and angry and off-balance after just a few days of hiding herself around strangers; why are we surprised that Harper is an even worse mess when she's doing it with her family? Of course she's acting shitty, look at the environment she was raised in! When she's in the city with Abby and John she can be her actual self, but in her parents house she reverts to being the paranoid closeted lying teenage trainwreck she was.",0
2464,"And if she'd stayed that way, Abby would've been entirely right to walk away and never look back. But, and this is the important part, Harper doesn't stay that way; she recognizes that she's been shitty to Abby, she admits her mistakes and apologizes and promises to do better. And as we see literally the next day, when she's openly cuddling with Abby on the couch, and when Abby is invited into the family picture, there is change and their is improvement. And if someone is working to change, is it really so wrong to give them another chance?",0
2465,I liked Happiest Season because it does what romcoms so rarely do; show a couple actually working through a problem and coming out the other side. ,0
2466,"Also, because Dan Levy. But who doesn't like Dan Levy? Jane stole every scene. Which is impressive when she’s the only actress I hadn’t seen anything of beforehand. Harper failing to save Abby from falling off the roof was basically a spoiler for how the rest of the movie would go. Consistently failing her girlfriend in like every department lol, really wish they went for a bold ending where they broke up. I was really happy when Kristen Stewart's character walked out and her girlfriend thought everything would be better when she told everyone.",0
2467,"I kind of wish they ended on that. I know it wouldn't be very christmassy, but I feel like rom coms should end that way sometimes. first of all can i just point out how GOOD kristen looked during the white elephant party. like the half buttoned shirt and eye makeup and hair and everything holy crap she shouldve left harper to date ME!",0
2468,yeah anyways i loved abby john and jane but harper? ew no gross!,0
2469,sloane did not need to be redeemed shes an asshole who outed her own sister outta jealousy..,0
2470,"harper also did not need to be redeemed at all. shes terrible, toxic, manipulative, mean, a hypocrite and bitchy. like yeah being closeted is hard but thats no excuse?! for being a terrible gf??!",0
2471,honestly i really hoped abby would’ve left harper for riley. they have wayyyy more chemistry! also john and janes friendship is everything i love them so much,0
2472,overall funny movie but the ending was super unrealistic so 6/10 Harper was unlikeable for 80% of this film lol,0
2473,This movie can be summed up by the one cut to the reindeers face while Santa was flying... aka what the hell was that.,0
2474,"It certainly did not live up to the first one, but to be fair it was more original than the majority of Christmas movies these days. One thing is for sure though, it could have done without that musical number... The dad's favorite song was O Christmas Tree. I mentally checked out of this movie after that scene. No one's favorite song is O Christmas Tree. I am watching it now, and the most annoying thing for my 4 year old daughter is how many subtitles there are but she is cuddling mom enjoying the movie. My 7 year old is loving it, like calling out to the screen and jumping around. I think its awful, obviously I'm writing this rather than watching. Worst part, my kids like it so much I'm definitely going to have to watch it a few more times.",0
2475,"Just noticed the gold! Thanks for the gift first ever! I liked how they acknowledged Santa Claus' origins as a bishop in 4th century Anatolia. Never seen a movie attempt to bring the story of the original St. Nicholas into the fold of modern-day Santa Claus mythology before. Watched it yesterday, a lot of ""what the fuck"" when it came to some of it. But I didn't hate it. Perfectly fine silly movie. Maybe one of the worst casting decisions I’ve seen with Belsnickel. The movie just couldn’t go anywhere with him in such a pivotal role It was very underwhelming...",0
2476,"The biggest WTF thing for me is that the parents ditch all the kids to go off resort for a night, in a foreign country no less. If Belsnickle couldn't get through the protective barrier to get back to the north pole, how was he able to leave after becoming human in the first place? Also why didn't he age if he became a human? I lol'd at the gingerbread cookie going ""ohh nooo"" right before exploding. Nice Mr. Bill homage As someone who loved the original, faults and all, I really didn't like this one.",0
2477,"Felt underdeveloped and rushed. Plus they switched out the humor for a more adventurous tone and that was a bad choice. A LOT of subtitles for a movie made for kids 10 and under. Seems to be the unpopular opinion in this thread, but I actually liked this one a lot better than the first movie. It definitely fell into some heavy sequel tropes, but the story felt a lot more cohesive instead a bunch of strung together set pieces. Not a masterpiece or anything, but Christmas movies don’t have to be “good” in the traditional sense. I enjoyed it and could imagine rewatching it again in later years. Why, oh why, did they choose to do an original musical number with so many amazing Christmas songs they could have pulled from? Terrible disappointment. The rest of the movie was passable, with a bad villain and way too much action. Overall... meh. Should have gone with a different casting. The villain amounted to teenage angst. Movie would have been over if Santa gave him a hug or something idk. Acting felt forced and quite flat to me. Loved the first one but this one leaves a lot to be desired.",0
2478,"However, the Christmas/North Pole town was pretty sick though. Yeah this sucks. The elves were the worst part of the first movie, now here's an entire movie about Santa's village and the elves. Also I'm pretty sure it was 95% CGI or green screen. I really just don't like the New Zealand actor kid. Hated him in Deadpool 2 as well. I don't know what it is exactly but he really takes me out of the movie. ""when I bring it back to the south pole, it'll be the shizz!""",0

They went back in time, then come back 15 second behind belsnickle so they can steal that star thing but you can't just come back.to your time line at a different time. Have people not seen Rick and Morty? That shit fuck the world up. Biggest plot hole in any film I've ever seen.",0
2480,"How did no one see a giant red sleigh in the sky, with 8 floating raindeer at the end in Mexico? People were all around on the beach, how did no one spot that? I loved the first movie. This one was terrible. Kurt Russel doesn’t get to shine at all as Santa. Mrs. Claus was useless and annoying. Rehashing the dead dad storyline AGAIN that I thought we resolved in the first movie was a total waste of the script. And the elves (which are weird looking, kinda creepy, super annoying, and the worst part of the first movie) are the main focus. Don’t get me started on how bad that villain was. Just awful. Hated it. I hate this movie only  because it got more press and  promotion the Klaus ever did. ",0
2481,"Klaus has yet to ever be in Netflixs top ten, despite Arctic Dog and Duck Duck Gose being Abel too.  And I'm so pissed they  gave this movie a big add campaign, so everyone will watch this movie, instead of discovering Klaus Best part of this movie was seeing Sunny Suljic towards the end. Hope to see boi in a lot more stuff going forward. It was alright, although they had the least threatening villain of all time Its got a longer ending than The Lord of the Rings. I liked it, but just like everyone else it seems, I think the first one was better. The first one perfectly blended fantasy and reality. It felt like what would really happen if it happened in real life. This one is just too unrealistic to give off that vibe. But that's a good thing. A movie and its sequel should feel different from each other.",0
2482,"I love the 1990 airport scene. Time travel is a favorite of mine and this movie used it in a simple but great way. Even if the thing with the batteries doesn't make sense. What's Santa doing with unopened 6-year-old batteries in his pocket? Why didn't they just have him not have batteries at all? And since when do batteries expire? Also, Kate stole the batteries from the gift shop.",0
2483,"Im not sure if anyone noticed. But  I liked the parallels of when they first sent him in to see if the black panther guy was going to cause violence  and didnt believe him about them not really being violent. But when he started going at the kkk, the organization, they kept dismissing how violent they would get and they end up trying to blow people up. Damn, that was heavy. Had me on edge the whole time! Powerful cinematography. One moment that stood out was the face portraits during the BSU speech towards the beginning.",1
2484,"I would watch it again, for sure. Tonight Spike Lee had us in the theater applaud Topher Grace performance as David Duke cause he felt he channeled Duke perfectly and gave a fantastic performance that isn’t getting enough credit. ",1
2485,"And he brought up how he knew John David Washington was perfect to cast cause he’s seen him in other things but also cause he’s Denzel’s son. He’s also one of the kids in the end of Malcolm X.  John David Washington has his father’s exact gait. I don’t know how else to describe it other than “sinking in to a strut.” Also i think Adam Driver is one of the best young/modern actors. His monologue about “I never thought about it before, but now it’s all I think about.” Was so great, I think he’s the most natural actor around.",1
2486,"This felt like a beautiful mesh between older Do The Right Thing, Malcom X, Crooklyn Spike Lee and later career Inside Man, 25th Hour Spike Lee. It was messy but it was a lot of fun.  TIL Steve Buscemi has an actor brother!  ALEC BALDWIN LOL  Adam Driver played a jewish man playing a black man playing a racist white man. ",1
2487,"What a time to be alive. John D Washington (aka Ricky Jarret) and Adam Driver were both great in this movie.  Also Topher Grace pulled off David Duke pretty well.  Whoever played Felix also did a great job of portraying a terrible human, good job by him. I just got out of this film watching in Downtown Charlottesville. Needless to say, the ending was incredibly powerful sitting in the theatre that is a couple of blocks away from Market Street Park (formerly Emancipation Park, formerly Lee Park) and only a few more blocks from 4th Street. I think Spike Lee made his message clear and maybe some think it is over done. But I think he wants it to be **as clear as humanly possible**. White nationalism is not dead, nor is it non-violent. In an attempt to illustrate that the effort of people like Stallworth, he shows that while these people experienced some level of success, these problems are not solved like many seem to think they are.  How are you going to cast Sicilian ass Nicholas Turturro as a member of the KKK?   The lie detectors scene genuinely might be the funniest scene I’ve ever seen.",1

2489,“You think it was fake? I think it makes perfect sense.”,1
2490,Overall hilarious and incredibly relevant movie. Loved every second. Fight almost broke out in my theater when the credits came up and a man yelled “Fuck Trump” which caught the attention of a few Trump supporters in the crowd.,1
2491,A movie that provocative deserves some praise. “Why don’t you come to Louisiana and see how we play?”,1
2492,"I was ready for Ron to lose it at that point. Sheeeeeeeeeatttttt. This was great! Such a well-directed film. You can really feel Spike Lee’s intentions in every scene. The fact that this was released on the anniversary of the events in Charlottesville is a pretty ballsy move, too.",1
2493,"Oh, and Shaft is better than Superfly. No competition there. [deleted] I loved how Spike does not let you get away with just enjoying the silly cop movie about some silly cop shit that happened in the 70s.  Yeah, these guys are ridiculous, but you get a couple true believers in there and they become extremely dangerous.  ",1
2494,"What a great and important movie, everyone should see it. Anyone think Jasper Pääkkönen (Felix) deserves high credit for playing a sleazy white supremacist when he's a Finnish dude? Someone give Topher grace a hug or something this sort  of role must be taxing   Fucking LOVED the last phone call with David Duke. ""Are uh, you sure about that?"" One of the funniest moments in the movie for me, and good thing too because I needed a laugh at the end of that.  I saw this film tonight at a theater here in Louisiana. After the ""Why don't you come down to Louisiana and see how we play?"" line, someone in the audience shouted ""Yeah!"" I felt sick.",1
2495,"It's so sickening to know that David Duke recently ran for office here and people actually voted for him. It was really rough to hear all of the Louisiana references.  The whole white power/black power scene was enthralling, had the same simmering tension as the 25th Hour rant. Shout out to the composer, a Spike Lee film wouldn’t feel like one without his music. When they were naming their black heros and they mention OJ as the their biggest influence, figuratively killed me out of laughter. Really showed how like able he was at the time.  The real life Ron Stallworth doesn’t feel that racism has changed since the days he infiltrated the KKK. ",1
2496," ""Let me put it this way, it hasn't changed,"" he told NPR. ""To me, race is the single most divisive factor affecting American society. It's an issue that we are afraid of, that we shy away from; and quite frankly, it amuses me that we are so sensitive to the issue.""

The Elasti-Cycle chase was TOO cool. Such a fun and creative way to show how she can her power. I was literally like, “how are they going to top this action scene?”",0

I guess when the hero resorts to sort of last ditch tactics of doing anything to win, it's kind of scary to watch. When he pulls out the tazer or paralysis stick, it seemed an uphill battle for her. ",0
2517,"The visuals of the supers under Screenslaver's control was creepy af.  I think every parent connected with the exhaustion of Mr. incredible taking care of a new baby. I was worried he was going to be jealous the entire film, but the switch to a physically and mentally drained parent was a welcome shift I can't believe we waited 14 years for the Underminer to get away. So is nobody going to mention how they were living in Bruce Wayne’s house? “A rich eccentric billionaire who didn’t like to be seen coming or going” I would never have guessed I’d watch a prolonged battle between Jack Jack and a raccoon, but I’m glad it happened.  The scene where Elastigirl was chasing the train looked BEAUTIFUL. The whole movie had amazing action and beautiful shots. Brad Bird did an Incredible job! (Pun intended) Jack-Jack shapeshifting into Edna.",0
2518,"“i sent you a mold of my foot plz respond” The ""Saoirse Ronan moves to New York and has multiple love interests"" trilogy is now complete. I love how the past was shot with a warm filter, and the present a cool one so if you couldn't figure it out contextually you had a clear understanding of which was which! From Jo and Laurie’s fight - is the line that ends it: “and ill watch” from the novel? Boy did it destroy me This movie needs a Bob Odenkirk trigger warning.  When he just hops into the film all of a sudden about an hour and a half into it, it's a bit jarring.  My wife and I couldn't stop laughing at his mere presence, let alone the mutton chops. Beth was so weird and sweet. I loved her. It was great that she had a personality outside of being “The Sick One.” Loved the theme of money and ownership in regards to women. Loved how Greta Gerwig blended Louisa May Alcott’s own story into the film. Alcott never married. The film’s end showed that it was the ownership of her own book that truly fulfilled her. One of my favs of the year. Just commenting to say that “12 year old” Florence Pugh in Dutch braids surrounded by actual other 12 year olds made me laugh out loud at the ridiculous contrast. Other than that and Chamalamalamalet clearly not aging through the whole movie, i really enjoyed it.",1
2519,"Edit: I also missed the instructive and helpful marmee portrayed by Susan Sarandon. I worship Laura Dern, but I’m not convinced that she really did justice to the character. ",1
2520,"One scene of her saying she was “ashamed of her country” isn’t really comparable to “If you feel your value lies in being merely decorative, I fear that someday you might find yourself believing that’s all that you really are. Time erodes all such beauty, but what it cannot diminish is the wonderful workings of your mind: Your humor, your kindness, and your moral courage. These are the things I cherish so in you. I so wish I could give my girls a more just world. But I know you’ll make it a better place.” I loved the whole movie but I have to say one of my all time favorite scenes I've ever seen on the big screen was the ""gentlemen's club"" scene where they are dressed as older men with the pipes. Genuinely hilarious and love that Laurie was hiding the whole time. The reveal that Bob Odenkirk plays their father is the fastest I’ve ever gone from crying to losing my shit in a movie. I think the most memorable scene of the movie for me is Amy's economical factor in choosing a husband monologue inside the painting workshop. It was a single take where the camera focuses and tracks with Pugh's face as she moves toward Laurie. The controlled delivery says so much, it adds a silent subtext to what was spoken. It conveys a woman in a time where it is un-lady-like to burst out how she really feels, yet the measured tone tells us so much more is hidden beneath the surface. Furthermore, her perfect articulation of the matter hints her intellect and how often she thinks about this unfair world, refining each time she is reminded that life, fate, and society have constantly placed her being second to someone else whether in being a sister of talent, a love interest, an artist, and a woman.",1
2521,"Edit: grammar and clarity The hard cut from Amy confessing that she loved Laurie to her 7 years prior sending him a mold of her feet is pretty much my entire dating life. THAT scene between Saoirse and Timothee was stunning. Thought the whole film was excellent but that scene...damn The ending was so meta with Jo writing a happily ever after for her protagonist, parallel with Louisa May Alcott being forced to write a romantic ending for her novel. ""Under the Umbrella"" is even the name of the last chapter in ""Little Women"", if my memory is correct. The flashbacks were a little confusing. Also, I was not convinced that Laurie was in love with Amy. He really wanted to be part of the March family and he was going to do so in any way he could. saoirse is fucking fire damn she can act. Holy crap a movie with over five A-List actors that is a solid film. I enjoyed it. Greta managed to turn a 500+ page book into a solid two and some change length movie. I love this movie so much. Just the kind of film you want to live in. I’ve seen it twice now and both times I found someone new to grab onto and follow emotionally. The first time I was fully into Jo’s journey, but the second time I was way more attuned to Amy (and also more cognizant of Beth). I can’t wait to go again and have another completely new experience (I also can’t wait to see this with an actual audience). ",1
2522,"Also, while the contrasting Christmas scenes absolutely destroyed me (the hold on Jo’s face is perfect), it hurt a lot more when Mr. Laurence is hovering outside his own mansion, afraid to go inside because he knows Beth won’t be there, and Jo offering to help go inside with him. This film does so well at carrying over what I liked most about Lady Bird: making me care about the side characters almost as much as the main characters. None of the Little Women are American actresses. 2 English, 1 Irish, and 1 Australian. ",1
2523,"I found that interesting at least since none of them sounded naturally American even Saoirse. We are just here to witness Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh’s careers. Jesus those two can act. YOU WILL BE BORED OF HIM IN 2 YEARS BUT WE WILL BE INTERESTING FOREVER!!! My girlfriend forced me to go, no regrets. I cried at least twice. Don’t tell anyone. I’m a little confused by the meta ending. ",1
2524,It’s frustrating because I personally love Friedrich Bhaer’s character in the book because I believe he propels Jo to become a writer of passion rather than just profit.,1
2525,"**But** what exactly does Jo and Friedrich’s ending imply in this adaptation? 😕 Non-linear structure was a fresh way to engage with this story.  Such a great choice. LADY BIRD WAS NOT A FLUKE. My poor 15 year old brother liked the movie much more than I believed he would, but he just told me he didn’t realize the story was non-linear.  I asked, and he didn’t question how Beth had died in one scene and then moments later she was talking to her sisters.  He DEFINITELY didn’t pick up on the changing color palettes, bless his heart.",1

Honestly quite an emotional scene bolstered by the beautiful music The X-Force dying after the high winds parachuting was honestly the most hilarious part of this movie. Juggernaut totally woke up at the end right? Jokes aside, I appreciated how many surprises were left in the movie and how little we got out of the trailer. The trailer focused on the X-Force team which made their sudden deaths hilarious. We had no idea Juggernaut was in this. There were even scenes in the trailer with Morena that weren't in the movie so even though she dies right off the bat I was still guessing if she'd come back some how. ",0

It’s just a badass hilarious and one of a kind super..vigilante movie  The parachuting scene killed me Kudos to the marketing. There was a lot of misdirection in the trailers. Like, in a surprisingly good way. Deadpool going back in time to kill X-Men Origins Deadpool and Ryan Reynolds is seriously one of the loudest laughs I’ve had in a theater!  Was the scene with Juggernaut being thrown into the water a big pun?? Cause they shoved a Cable up his butt and threw him into a Pool??",0
2535,Please note this film is known as *Le Mans '66* in many non-domestic markets. An unforgettable moment in the movie for me was when Ford was crying after the ride with Shelby. We were led to believe that the ride scared the crap out of Ford.... Until he revealed the thought about his dad. Very touching. I loved the film. I would happily pay the cost of a movie to just watch Christian Bale chirp at other drivers in various moods as he passes them. I know that everybody talks about the acting of Damon and Bale but man... Jon Bernthal is just awesome.,1

2538,"Also, I did NOT expect that many Ford GT40s. Even if half of those were CGI, all the racing scenes must have cost a fortune.",1

I always pictured this story has a TNT miniseries, but Mangold made it into a blockbuster! Bale's performance is absolutely great. But Josh Lucas? He sure knows how to pull off a very convincing a-hole. After watching Christian Bale scream in British for 2.5 hours, i can confirm that I too, am now also British 7000+",1

2545,"What a movie. Struck an amazing balance between the pure adrenaline of the race, the curiosity of the steps they take to make the car, and the great moments between the principal cast. Miles looking in his rear view mirror and seeing nobody even close to him was a beautiful moment, recognizing he actually accomplished what he set to achieve. As someone who knows (and cares) embarrassingly little about cars, I honestly thought that going to this movie would be a 2.5hour long favour to my bf. However I can truly say I loved it. It was really moving, despite the fact that I wasn’t expecting the ending. I also thought the acting was awesome and I felt for every character. All in all, it definitely didn’t feel like 2.5 hours. Ken Miles: I'm in Shelby's car. Vroom vroom. ",1
2546,The suits at Ford: Get out me car! Props to the screenwriters because I don’t think I could have ever adapted this movie responsibly. I would’ve taken way too much creative license and written a scene at the end where Miles and Shelby beat the shit out of Leo Beebe.,1
2547,Easily the most punchable character I’ve seen in 2019. Fuck that guy. Hats off to Josh Lucas. Holy crap be careful leaving the Theater some people drive straight stupid after this film.,1
2548,Anyway I loved this movie and might be my favorite of the year. Damon and Bale were out standing. The race scenes had me at edge of my seat. The ending tho :( Was anyone else who was unfamiliar with the story sure that Miles was going to die at LeMans after Phil hammered the door shut? Never before has a movie given off more dad vibes than this one,1
2549,"10/10 would watch with my son and ruffle his hair Loved it and didn't really expect to. My favorite shot is kind of dumb, but it's when Miles was left in the Shelby garage after the whole team went to France. It's night, and there's a plane taxiing in front of a car carrier with a Ford racecar on top. Bale is silent, watching the plane, and the light from the taxiing silhouettes the racecar on the carrier so the shadow looks like a car is slowly moving on the wall of the hangar above Miles' head. It felt like one of the few ""quiet"" moments of the film and I just really liked the set up. There’s a nice subtle moment in the movie that people may or may not have caught. In the fight scene, there’s a point where Shelby grabs a jar as Miles is on top of him, you can tell that Shelby realizes this because he ungrips the jar and immediately goes for the Wonder Bread instead. Its quick so you might not have seen it, but if you did, I thought that was an amazing moment to help convey the respect and mutual friendship they had for each other. How many people can play sleezy better than Josh Lucas? Would anyone be willing to let me know if there are any crash sequences that involve flames? ",1

2556,&#x200B;,0
2557,The fucking swarm of taxi drivers gave me mild PTSD lol This was a fantastic movie. One element in particular that I appreciated was that it didn't default to a Western vs. Eastern philosophy thing where the Western way of doing things inevitably comes out on top.* ,0
2558,"I come from a non-Chinese Asian culture and it's all too often that a story will get to the point where the hardass Asian parents have no choice but to admit that their child embracing Western individualism is what made them succeed or whatever. That might be true in isolated cases (Bohemian Rhapsody smacks of this, for instance, and is obviously based on a true story; alternatively, Crazy Rich Asians I think suffers from this and is entirely fictional), but it's so hard to articulate (mainly to non-Eastern friends, or even my non-Eastern wife) why some of us from Eastern cultures tend to adhere to seemingly strange or authoritarian/rigid social norms between ourselves and our parents or broader family. And when the only kind of film you see is the exceptional story where the immigrant succeeds in spite of their rigid cultural upbringing, that shines a really, really negative light on Eastern culture as a whole, which is very unfair.",0
2559,"This film did an excellent job of speaking to the opposite of that, that Asian cultures that give individualism (or American exceptionalism, as it may be) a smaller role to play in the lives of people and their families is not a lesser path, but an alternate path that is meritorious in its own way. It's nice to know that there is an uptick in those kinds of projects.",0
2560,"*I realize that this is also based on a true story, but I think even 5-10 years ago, it would be difficult for me to imagine a movie like this being made. Saw this a couple months ago at Atlanta Film Festival, had a Q&A with Awkwafina and Lulu Wang afterwards which was great. ",0
2561,"According to Wang, the real Nai Nai, who's still around of course, still has no idea. She was even on set for portions of filming, including the goodbye scene, and giving instruction to the actress playing her, but the details of the movie and character were still kept from her. I just want to say, among many other comments i’ll probably leave: The cinematography was fucking GORGEOUS. What camera did they shoot on? I could not stop crying after the scene where they drive away from Nai Nai, even after walking out the theater ""Don't worry Billie, I'll throw you an even bigger wedding when you get married!"" ",0
2562,"^(Quiet Weeping.) Is it weird the part that hit me the hardest was near the end when Nai Nai was imparting her wisdom to Billi about not worrying too much with not getting the fellowship and that things will work out? English speaking Billi and Mandarin speaking Billi are two entirely different characters and Awkwafina nailed that perfectly. Anyone else lose it with the end scene and the shot of Nai Nai waving back to them? I can't think about it or else I start crying. Billi's mom (Jian, played by Diana Lin) was an awesome character to me. I thought she brought a lot to the story with her dinner table argument with Nai Nai's niece about the U.S. and China and their children, and then with her scenes with Billi. I thought it was pretty useful for characterization to have her talk about her tougher relationship with Nai Nai, and just her various back-and-forths with Billi. ",0
2563,"Awkwafina definitely deserves awards buzz for her lead role, but Lin is awesome too in the supporting role. I loved this movie so much. There's so much this movie does so well, from its incredible cast to the tight direction to details like billi's broken mandarin (which I wish was played up even more tbh), the seamless switching between languages, and the uncomfortable discussions of ""do you like America or here more?"". It's so warm and you can genuinely feel the love and history between this family while also being presented with a compelling argument behind why they decided to keep this from nai nai. ",0
2564,A specific scene I wanted to point out was the uncle's discussion with billi about eastern culture's emphasis on being part of the whole versus the west's more individualistic mindset. It's an amazing encapsulation of the difference between these two cultures and the uncle's restraint and delivery of his monologue was phenomenal.,0
2565,"Another scene which I really loved was Nai Nai showing off her stretching routine to Billi, especially the decision to set the camera in a single, narrow pov and allow them exit and enter the frame as they run around the scene. It's such a smart way to show off their chemistry and is one of many examples of Wang's excellent directing.",0
2566,"Finally, until I read more about the real story, I also loved how Nai Nai's actress was able to sell you on the ambiguity of whether or not she actually knows what the family is doing. There's a lot to say about this movie, but all I want to say right now is that Awkwafina was outstanding. She will definitely get an Oscar nomination, and I'm all here for it.",0
2567,Never discount an actor just because you've only seen them in one kind of role. The real Nai Nai watching this movie: ,0
2568,"""yo hol up wtf"" I loved it. The only thing is I wish we got to here a bit from her cousin. He was really relegated to the background when it was his wedding lol. Lovely film though. People cheered at the ending lol. I was expecting the feels, but I didn’t expect it to be as hilarious as it was. The cemetery scene where they were arguing over whether the grandfather quit smoking before he died was especially riotous.",0
2569,"Still didn’t stop me from being a blubbering mess when Nai Nai waved goodbye. My audience started cheering at the end when it was revealed that Nai Nai was still alive. I was worried this would be too saccharine or preachy, but it really wasn't. As someone unfamiliar with Chinese culture, it did a great job of showing the contrasting ideologies without picking sides. I was fascinated. ",0
2570,"Really visually beautiful too, with great color choices. That scene with Billi talking to her dad and uncle in the hotel lobby at night was gorgeous. And at the spa. ",0
2571,One of those rare films that makes me feel sad that it's over and I can't be immersed in its world anymore. Totally exceeded expectations My heart was absolutely shattered when Nai Nai’s sister at the wedding said not to worry about her because she’ll be alright and join her husband who she hasn’t seen in a while. Her face when she turned away destroyed me. Ok everyone else is talking about the movie enough. I just gotta say though. ,0
2572,THE FOOOD. ,0
2573,I went with a whit friend and she was like all they did was talk and eat food. Like too much food. ,0
2574,I was like...yup...that’s sort of really how it is.,0
2575," It all looked so amazing. Profoundly beautiful, intimate and melancholy. Balances humor and drama perfectly. Lulu does an amazing job using the device of dramatic irony (something the audience knows that a character doesn't - in this case the diagnosis) to put us in the shoes of a family. It makes us connect to Awkwafina's character even further and the intimate blocking makes us feel like we are right there next to her, which engages us in the narrative a way too few films even try to make us do. I loved this movie, and it hit close to home in a few ways having recently lost a grandmother and having not seen one in 5+ years. ",0
2576,"This is one of A24's finest acquisitions, and I cannot wait to see Lulu's next work. I loved the cast and I hope Awkwafina gets the dramatic break she deserves. A much earned Oscar nom and even win (depending on how this year shapes up) can certainly help.",0
2577,"10/10 ffs, make it a wide release already! I've been waiting patiently for it to show in a theater near my home (in the DFW metroplex), so that I can watch with my family, but this slow release is such a buzzkill. I want to watch with them (and support A24 with more money), but at the same time, I don't know if this is the widest release it'll get, so I might have to watch it by myself, or else it may be pulled from theaters before I know it. ",0
2578,"A24's *Midsommar* has run its course in theaters, and *The Farewell* has had a pretty respectable Per Theater Gross for the past three weeks. Just replace *Midsommar* with *The Farewell* already! That final scene of her standing there while they went away was a little too close for comfort. Kinda broke me. Superb film, really touching. Poor Japanese girl she was the one who suffered the most in this movie This film hits hard for me being a Chinese American. Facing the mortality of a grandmother that looks, acts and speaks like your own was so heartbreaking to watch. I came out of the movie theater devastated wanting to call my parents and grandparents to let them know I love them. That culture of not telling people bad news because it's ""too much trouble"" and to shoulder all the emotional trauma is so real for Chinese people. The cinematography was beautiful. The compositions of people, places and objects were so pleasing to watch. The soundtrack felt wide and encompassed the film to feeling bigger than just the story of this particular family. The dialogue was real and the way the actors and actresses portrayed them was almost identical because I see the same mannerisms in my own family. The way Nai Nai slaps Billi when she feels happy and calls her ""stupid girl"" but means it in the most loving way possible. This film broke my heart. Lulu Wang deserves all the praise she will get. Really loved this moved, I thought Awkwafina did amazing. I legit found myself growing more and more concerned for the grandmother’s well-being towards the end.",0
2579,"My one thing, I know the chemistry between the newlyweds is played for laughs, but I would’ve loved some insight from them, especially the grandson, on getting married hastily under the circumstances.",0
2580,"Marvin Gaye's isolated vocals are some of the best use of music I've seen in film for a long, long time. That whole 'What's Going On' sequence gave me chills. Jonathan Majors and Delroy Lindo as father and son is pitch perfect casting, and boy was Lindo amazing. I hope he continues to get attention throughout the year. The rope tugging scene was absolutely terrifying. And it's great to see Jonathan Majors in more movies following The Last Black Man in San Francisco. It's hard to know at this point what films are coming out for the rest of the year but I sure hope Delroy Lindo gets an Oscar nomination for that performance. Sheeeeeeeeeeeit Oh man I missed this Chadwick Boseman. Felt really bad for him seeing all those pictures where he’s doing the ‘wakanda forever’ sign. Man looked dead inside (I’m only guessing). Hope he goes onto do more roles like in 42, Get on Up and Marshall. Did anyone else find it painfully obvious that >!eddie would step on a landmine when he just randomly started monologue-ing and walking backwards unnaturally?!<",0
2581,Also super ironic to make a point about throwing all Americans into one political ideology bucket only to stereotype almost every single French and Vietnamese character,0
2582,"Decent film with some awesome messages, but some reallyyyy ham fisted ways of pushing the narrative forward One of the things I thought was interesting was the repeated hugging. At the beginning when they meet up, they hug and the reverse angle shows them hugging again. I thought it was a mistake, but it’s done multiple times and it seems intentional. ",0
2583,"Interesting editing throughout. It was a nice touch how everyone was their old selves in the flashbacks except Stormin Norman. Really enjoyed it. Just one thing that bothered me, is that they went back to get Norman's remains. I wasn't even sure they had actually taken them until the end when they had the casket come out of the plane in the epilogue. Very weird to me that they seemed to leave their others bloods that died behind, though I guess it's more practical to carry a skeleton and they didn't want to switch gold weight out for dead weight... Wow this is a real love/hate comment section. It's either great or terrible.",0
2584,I really liked it. I can agree with some criticisms but I'm surprised with all the hate it's getting here.,0
2585,>**After Credits Scene?** No  ,0
2586,There isn't a scene but there is an added little behind the scenes bonus that I liked ; ) HEY BUDDY DO YOU WANT TO BUY A CHICKEN I want to narrow in on something very specific:,0
2587,"Does it rub anyone else the wrong way that the bulk of the villains that are mowed down are random Vietnamese guys? Yes, the main important villain was a rich white dude (and I get it, wealthy imperialists make the lower class fight among themselves), but the cannon fodder is a group of people that basically have as much claim to the gold as the bloods do. Clearly the movie is concerned about the way the US used and abused black Americans during the conflict, but it seems like it doesn't care much for the Vietnamese who faced the same sorts of manipulation and oppression. It pays lip service to the concept ""The American War turned families against one another"" but by about the half way point it kinda just drops that compassionate comparison. Suddenly it's ""Bloods good, Vietnamese bad."" and never provides a real resolution to the notion that the two groups should by all rights be on the same side. I understand everything Spike Lee wanna says for black people throughout the film, and Vietnam is only the background for the whole story. But as a Vietnamese, that background is very wrong, unrealistic, illogical, and shows that his crew was too lazy and did not do enough research about Vietnam.",0
2588,"The bar scene is cliche. Apocalypse is a real bar, and disabled kid like in the film is unlikely to get inside. Why is he disabled though? Because of the war? He was born in the XXI century. And how the hell can he get firecrackers? They are banned here for years. A beggar like him can afford firecrackers just to throw them at random foreign guys? That scene is bullshit, though I understand Lee wanna portrays their trauma.",0
2589,"Before that a little bit, the cheers scene is cliche. We did that in many propaganda films. So it may be big for Americans, but not so much to Viet. It feels even forced. We moved on.",0
2590,"To the floating market, why trying to sell chickens to tourists? That is laughable. How did he know these characters were GI? Once again, it was very, very forced and unrealistic. We moved on from this phase long ago and do not bear hatred towards Americans.",0
2591,"Vietnamese in the film are stereotypes. Who are these guys with rifle in the jungle? Cops, military, ex-military? No. Stereotype villains? Yes. I doubt that the government allow people to run around with guns like that, especially involving foreign people (I am talking about these French). You would say they paid under-table money to get into the jungle, and acquire some stupid paper showing at the beginning. No! If the government knows about the area, with these gunners running around, these four guys would never be allowed inside, even with a lot of money. ",0
2592,"You can say what you want, but the Vietnam background in the movie shows that Americans hasn’t moved on and still keeps a lot of prejudice towards the country. I appreciate the messages for black people. But other than that, it is a failure. ",0
2593,"On social media in Vietnam, Da 5 Bloods has become a laughing stock. Man, it was really hard to not think of the Tropic Thunder mine scene How old is anyone in this movie supposed to be? Vietnam War was like 50 years ago. You telling me that guy's daughter he had with the Vietnamese lady was anywhere near thirty? The film was... ok, but my biggest problem is that it lacked any subtlety at all. It seems like Spike Lee must not put much faith in his audience‘s intelligence, because everything was explained, including actions, thoughts, and feelings of every character. A better filmmaker would have found a way to deliver their message through better dialogue or story, but these characters straight up pontificate every time the director wants you to know something important about them. I loved it. What a character Paul turned out to be. Delroy Lindo did a great job. >!Scene where he leaves the group is my absolute favourite!<. He was throwing out soliloquys and stuff. Wow, just wow. Black Hamlet. He is the motherfucker. The scene between Paul and Norman was so good. I just felt a weight lift off of my back when seeing that scene, just seeing a troubled man approach his demons and forgive himself. Chadwick Boseman and Delroy Lindo were amazing in this movie. I'm kind of mixed on this, I liked the performance by the actor playing Paul but there are just parts of this that make no sense, like they go to all this effort to recover their friend's remains and bring them home and one of them is blown up, burried and seemingly forgotten about straight away and another is murdered in some location unknown to them. One of their main goals is to bring their comrades home back to US soil and they end up exchanging him for another two who die and stay there and there doesn't seem to be any scene or beat where they seem to regret it. I'm sure out of the 2k comments on here, someone's brought it up, but I really liked the use of Aspect Ratios. It separated between time frames, but it did fullscreen when ""shit got real."" Solid first half at least. Spike Lee has a few gems and a few bombs in his filmography, and this joint feels like a compilation series of both.",0
2594,"The first half of this film was very solid. My biggest gripe is when Otis goes to see the girl -- the acting in this scene from her was bad beyond comprehension as to how she got hired. Everything else I highly enjoyed and the stylistic choices I found to be very suitable. The aspect ratio switches, the choice to keep them old in the flashbacks, everything had me hooked. Funny enough, I actually stopped this movie midway through because I had to go to sleep and I picked back up on it today.",0
2595,"And honestly I wish I stopped there. The very MOMENT this movie goes to complete hell is when the first guy blows up. It felt like the cheapest route to go narratively to raise the stakes and keep conflict. At this point, I was like ""why the hell couldn't they have just gone home and spent their money, happy ending?"" I liked the scene of getting the son off the mine, and I wish they switched that moment around so it could be the last thing that happens when they're in the jungle -- it would've been a great climax -- then they go home and I would've felt very satisfied. I would've felt they found the gold in an oddly easy way, but hey, better than what happens next. But nope, more unnecessary emotion porn needs to occur.",0
2596,"Now we have to deal with the landmine experts, the soldiers searching for the gold, Paul going apeshit, a double cross from a French man, and a big shoot out that results in most of them dying, and for WHAT? What did any of that add to the film? With the main message being about the war haunting these people and the torture it puts on others, everything had already been said. It turned into a cheap action movie with the dumb twist of Paul accidentally killing Norman too -- WHY? Can't he just be fucked up for the sake of being in a fucked up war, we have to add some guilty conscious bullshit too?",0
2597,"I'm not sure of Lee's intent with the second half. Was it supposed to feel like a nightmare? Like a bad drug trip? If so, he succeeded, but what is that trying to convey? How is it suitable to fit with the first half of the movie which felt fairly by the numbers for a Lee movie?",0
2598,"Anyway, Delroy Lindo was fantastic, but this movie needed another rewrite, and if not, at least another draft of editing to trim this thing at least 15-20 more minutes down. I didn't HATE it, but I am very disappointed because it could've been great all around. Instead, they threw on an extra hour and a half for what felt like no reason.",0
2599,"First half -- 8/10. Second half -- 4/10. Overall -- 6/10 Damn, I really enjoyed it so I'm surprised to see some people completely shitting on it. I really loved the scene where the vietnamese kid threw firecrackers at them and they all instantly got down onto the ground with their hands on their heads. Brief but really hits hard.",0
2600,"Loved it, but the cinematography should get all the awards. It was absolutely beautiful without drawing attention to itself. Amazing.  The opening sequence with the CinemaScope logo was so damn cool. ",1
2601,"The end was the most important. When they both see what could of been if they stayed with each other, it makes me think about our personal dreams. When we pursue our dreams are we sure we're pursuing the dream we absolutely want? Is there a road that we should of taken that would of made us happier. Being young and not knowing what I want to do with my life yet, this hit home hard, because I don't know if what I want is what I want and if it is what I want what windows will close when I take that road. Reminds me of a Sylvia Plath quote ",1
2602,"""I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story.  From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked.  One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out.  I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose.  I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet."" ",1
2603," One thing that surprised me about this film was how funny it was at times. I was legitimately guffawing in the theater. The key gag, the entire 80s cover band scene, etc. I really hope Ryan Gosling continues to take on comedic roles. He was fantastically hilarious in The Nice Guys, and did well here, too. I don't know if anyone else noticed this or if anyone said this, but this movie is literally a jazz song. Remember the one scene where Seb is describing jazz to Mia and how even though it can be the same song it is never played the same way twice and at different times the drummer or sax player might go off and do their own thing and play the song their way. And throughout the movie there would be times when they would just focus on Mia or Seb and the decision they are making (see Seb playing piano in the restaurant or Mia's final audition). Then in the final scene at the club we see how their lives could have been different together if they made different decisions. But they always start at the restaurant and end at the club. So just like a jazz song can be played a little bit differently depending on the musicians decide to play it, it still is the same song that starts and ends the same way. Just like they meet at the restaurant and end at the club.  It answers it's own questions. ""How can something be new while also being traditional?"" Like this. Just. Like. This. ",1
2604,"It is very meta in a really sly way. ""What if it's too nostalgic and people don't like it?""",1
2605,"""Fuck em"" The movie is nostalgic with its odes to classic jazz music, and classic films and uses repetition in the cinematography that is nostalgic in and of itself. But ultimately, behind all the subtleties and the clever allusions; it's just a very very brilliant love story, in an age that's become too cool for them. ",1
2606,"10/10   What a treat. But I'll tell you the moment my heart broke.  Emma Stone's character says earlier in the film when talking about jazz ""I always thought it was something that people put on in the background when they talk to each other.""",1
2607,"Gosling freaks out and says that's the antithesis of it, and that real jazz needs to be experienced live, that's what it's about.",1
2608,"But later, when the pair of them are arguing for the first time and Gosling's in his sell out band, what's playing in the background? A classic jazz record. Gosling had forgotten his roots and what made Emma dig him in the first place. Dang shame, man. I want to dress like Ryan Gosling does in this movie  My god those last 15 minutes absolutely tugged my heart in all directions. Perfect way to cap off a dazzling film. This was such a fantastic film to watch. Really lifted my spirits after a troublesome year. My only complaint is that it's not as ""musical"" as I hoped it'd be. It has all of these wonderful musical numbers in the beginning, but there's a surprising lack of them during the middle of the movie.  In the early scene where Sebastian and Mia first meet in the restaurant, I was floored that they didn't use the scene from the trailer. I realize they used it later, but in that moment they seriously had me guessing that they used it in the trailer just to throw me off for the actual movie -- I loved it. For those haven't seen it yet: Enjoy the last remaining moments of your life without having ""City of Stars"" stuck in your head  Really loved the movie, and I'm sure many others have noticed this, but I haven't seen anything written about it yet. This film was very similar to Casablanca in terms of its plot/themes. I think this is why they reference Casablanca on the studio lot, and in the montage at the end, the plane flying across the globe to Paris was like Casablanca's imagery.",1
2609,"But think about it, Mia and Sebastian have a ""theme"" in the same way that Rick and Ilsa had ""As Time Goes By"" as their theme. Additionally, they do not end up together in much the same way, as they both have to live their respective lives and thus can't be together. Just like Rick and Ilsa will ""always have Paris"", Mia and Sebastian will always have Los Angeles. That ending was so sad and sweet, and it really made me think of Casablanca, even in the way that Mia's new husband seems like such a good guy, just how Victor was a great man in Casablanca, conflicting our feelings about the way the main couple does not end up together.",1
2610,"What do you guys think? Absolutely beautiful movie, by the way.  I liked how the ending was primarily from Mia's perspective. Had it worked out, Seb could not have lived his dream. He would have had a great life, playing in a jazz band in Paris and having kids with her, but it wasn't his ultimate dream.",1
2611,"And that's what this film does so well - it's about two ppl who fall in love and help each other reach their dreams...They just don't end up together. After watching Rogue 1, Manchester by the Sea, Moonlight, and Jackie. This movie affected me on levels I knew I had but never realized before and absolutely every minute of it whiplash and now La La land have officially fucked me up One line that stuck to me was when Seb said:",1
2612,"""It's LA, where people worship everything, but value nothing.""",1
2613,"I think that applies to a lot of places, but here in LA I see it. There's many historical spots that back in the day were popular, awesome, or just part of culture or held importance. Then today those places are either closed down, torn down and replaced by a skyscraper or something else, or not valued at all. Angel's Flight was something I saw it often growing up and seeing it go up and down in the middle of the day made me want to ride it one day. It looked cool. Now it's closed (temporarily I think) and it bums me I never got to ride it. ",1
2614,"A lot of places basically require someone to claim it and take care of it, government to landmark it, or support of a group. Otherwise, it's lost forever because the general population moves and doesn't value the importance of it. That's what's happening to Jazz. That's what Seb is worried about. Jazz has an important historical impact but it's sound is being changed. Seb doesn't think it's right for traditional Jazz to die out, but no one cares because it's no one is valuing it.",1
2615,Just my take on that quote. It hit me hard. Was pretty deep.  La La Land is everything beautiful about cinema. ,1
2616,"The film is about keeping art fresh, exciting and alive, and Chazelle uses the language of film to its fullest to do exactly that. The performances are stellar, the colours are popping, the cinematography is beautiful, and the soundtrack is already one of my favourites of all time - it's amazing how powerful a simple piano motif can be. ",1
2617,"It has no shame being romantic and open about its ideas about passion and ambition, and expressing it as a musical was the perfect choice. I watched an advanced screening and have been telling everyone to go see it. Give Mr Chazelle all your money! Also, I love subtly clever titles.",1
2618,"Dare I say... 10/10. Thank god Ryan Gosling played Sebastian.  Miles Teller (who was cast before they dropped him) is a great actor, but I feel like he would have come off as too much of a jerk.  He was much better suited for Whiplash. So can we talk about one of the major themes in this film - the idea that people dream and sometimes those dreams are foolish and futile but the very act of chasing those dreams can be quite magical. It's romantic and yet heartbreaking but also, I think, *vital*.",1
2619,"I walked out of the cinema and as I walked out two older women were chatting about the film and out of the blue they turned to me and another couple standing in the aisle and asked us if we liked it. I said yes. The other guy was a bit nonplussed. The older woman starts talking about Mia's audition scene and she goes ""You know, life is short. You should try a bit of everything. Don't waste your chances because you never when those chances could be gone. And when they're gone, they're gone""",1
2620,"And that started a wonderful conversation about the film and just life in general. It resonated so much with me. So... here's to the fools who dream. Keep the dream alive! Review: Had to pee ten minutes in and didn't leave until the movie ended. 10/10 would endure again saw it on Thursday, so breathtaking, my theater applauded for this film, anyone else? Me: just fuck my shit up",1
2621,"La La Land: say no more fam The Griffith Observatory sequence was done just so beautifully. After they kiss and it did that little fade out, my theater erupted with applause.",1
2622,"But the ""What Could've Been"" Sequence at the end, my god, that was done so masterfully. The culmination of every song woven together, the performances, the damn emotions, all with a ""The End"" title card. ",1
2623,This whole film reignited my passion for filmmaking when I have been in a bit of a dry spell and really made me feel just so grateful to be (hopefully) working in this industry professionally one day. ,1
2624,"It is such an inspirational film to the people who want to follow their dreams, but isn't afraid to tell you the truth about what happens if you do go for them. ",1
2625,This is an honest and insightful film with such powerful direction and an amazing soundtrack that hasn't gotten out of my head for the past week. ,1
2626,"This is why I appreciate when a studio is not afraid to take risks, Chazelle has only wrote and directed ONE major motion picture, and yet, they trusted him every step of the way to make an ORIGINAL musical for 10x the budget of Whiplash and not only succeeded, but has gotten critical acclaim and has been starting to pick up the awards. He mentioned that this was his passion project and damn well shows. ",1
2627,Congrats to the entire cast and crew for making a damn near perfect film that I will be watching many times to come! This was my favorite movie this year. I saw it two days ago and can't get the music out of my head. I think I've fallen in love with Emma Stone. ,1
2628,"Did anyone notice how the final scene was basically Casablanca? Of all the gin joints in all the world, she walks into mine (with her husband). Then they listen to a piano piece and imagine what could've been. But in the end it wasn't meant to be.",1
2629,"I *personally* was very disappointed that they didn't stay together in the end. I totally understand why, and it was very reminiscent of Casablanca and An American in Paris with the bittersweet ending. The only thing I would say is Hollywood Oscar movies try to shy away from happy endings over the past few years because the ""happily ever after"" ending is considered silly. (Even La La Land mocks the idea.) BUT the movie was FULL of ""happily ever after"" events. The barista gets discovered and becomes a huge star. That doesn't happen in real life! That's silly. And grumpy losers don't get invited into popular bands. Haha. I mean there's a scene of dancing in outer space for crying out loud. There's already so much happiness and silliness and rule bending in the movie, a ""happily ever after"" ending would've worked fine. ",1
2630,"The bittersweet ending of Casablanca works so much better because it had to be that way. Rick couldn't get with the women he loves because she was married (and the dude was a great guy), and as a couple they were so important to the war effort. In La La Land, it's like they couldn't be together.... because??? It's not even like the excuse was that Mia was too busy for a relationship (she ended up getting married anyway) or that Ryan Gosling's character had something to do that would prevent him from being in a relationship (he just played a piano lol).",1
2631,"I thought the ending was very well done, but personally would've enjoyed a happy ending more. Even if the characters weren't together, just hint that they *could* be together if they chose. Maybe I'm just a sucker. This film had a heart like (500) Days of Summer, and the song and dance numbers were so well-written. It's an unapologetic romance, the antithesis to these cynical and bitter times we're going through at the moment. as someone who lives in LA, how does Ryan Gosling go from the Warners Lot  in Burbank to Hermosa Beach in time for the sunset? Were you even trying Damien Chazelle? 2/10 literally unwatchable...",1
2632,But seriously this is a landmark achievement. Loved everything about this movie. Don't think I've met a single person with anything bad to say about it. Director and Picture are a lock and I hope Emma edges Natalie Portman out for the Oscar. (Also bets on when the musical adaptation hits Broadway?),1
2633,"And oh my god the ending sequence. The whole ""what could have been..."" just tugged on my heartstrings and left me wonderfully bittersweet. Bravo to everyone involved",1
2634,"That Mike Myers joke was golden ""Fuck yo baby"" got, by far, one of the biggest laughs in the theater. Just want to call out Jamie Foxx for not only his on point comedic timing, but his menace. He was legitimately frightening as a character. ""You and I are a team. Nothing is more important than our friendship."" Just got out of a early showing. More action than comedy, and a whole lot more heart than I was expecting. The scenes are woven together so tightly, with musical beats flowing in and out to keep you on this wonderful ride. Hell even Baby's free running was tense. Loved it. I bet his real name is Miles Prower With Jon Bernthal as Red Herring. I don't think I've ever seen so many different things timed to music before. Bullets, car doors, sirens, dialogue. Music becomes the heartbeat of the entire film, and I could never get enough.  > **After Credits Scene?** Yes, Shaun and Scott Pilgrim invite Baby to join the Edgar Wright Kino Initiative",0
2635,"You are a lying liar who lies. I love the idea of an ""action musical."" This entire movie was basically the ""Don't Stop Me Now"" scene from Shaun of the Dead and I fucking loved it! This movie works on almost every level for me.   The first 30 minutes or so are just unreal. The way every sound synced with the music. I've never quite seen anything like it. It was like Rhapsody in Blue almost.  I was not expecting Jon Hamm to become the main villain, love that reversal. Nor was I expecting Kevin Spacey to end up being so helpful. ""Have you ever even shot a gun before?""",0
2636,"""I just did.""",0
2637,"""Literally five minutes ago.""",0
2638," Did anyone else like how Kevin Spacey's nephew was playing a PlayStation Vita. Frank Underwood would be proud.  Hamm and the overflowing coffee was such a Don Draper moment that got a huge laugh from the audience I don't know who Lily James is but I have a huge crush on her now. Kevin Spacey delivered the fuck out of that Monsters Inc line   Didn't know it was filmed in Atlanta until the opening sequence and then spent the entire movie pointing out all the landmarks. The record store he goes to is my favorite one! Criminal Records! Great movie! Glad it was filmed and took place in my hometown! I could watch the gunfight editing over and freaking over. It was ""bananas."" I love so much about this film. The humor was so well done in this film. Didn't hit you over the head with jokes but the dialogue was so sharp that you couldn't help but laugh every now and then. The action was also very well done and expertly shot. Just a great spectacle of a movie.  Can I just take a moment to point out how beautiful the background of the laundromat scene was, it was so simple but looked amazing. At the end of the movie, The Baby Driver is arrested by the Monroe County police. Monroe is located Southeast of Atlanta on I-75. However, throughout the movie, The Baby Driver expresses a wish to drive West on I-20 and never stop. So basically, movie, what the fuck? So when The Punisher said ""if you don't see me again, it's cuz I'm dead"", did he die? Man driving home from the theater in my Toyota Corolla was seriously disappointing.

2645,"Worth the watch for the visuals alone. Sony is doing some good shit with their animated films. The robots easily could have wiped out humanity with warfare but decided to go the extra mile and take all of humanity captive, launch them into space, and insult them the entire time. I appreciate that level of pettiness. [deleted] It's so rare for an animated movie--even just movies in general--to have a positive sibling dynamic. Good stuff. The two robots are the best thing ever 😂 I want a show with just them and the mom The loaf of bread was worth saving the world for It was sort of hilarious how they played “Live your Life“ multiple times in that movie but made sure you didn‘t hear a single word of T.I.‘s parts. Hello I'm dog Mike Rianda delivers greatly with just his first feature film. The captivating visuals, the excellent pacing and the surprisingly complex characters make this a must-watch in my eyes. Admittedly the main antagonist felt kind of undercooked since they don't dwell on her feelings for that long. The feeling of being abandoned and sidelined could've made for great drama in the right hands. But otherwise there aren't major issues that I can think of.",0
2646,"I highly recommend giving this a watch if you can, especially if you were part of the Gravity Falls fandom back in the day since a lot of its staff members were a part of this (even Alex Hirsch himself makes a brief appearance). I'm definitely lining up for Rianda's next major film for sure! I love how the character designs are super cartoony compared to Pixar except for the furbies who are photorealistic and detailed Great movie, but does anyone know at which timestamp I blinked missing Conan O'Brien as Glaxxon 5000? this movie was so good!! it honestly hit my emotions in a way no movie ever has before and I think thats really impressive. “What is death” with head tilt, sad piano, and darkening background had me laughing for like 5 min I would die for Aaron Mitchell. Every line he has is golden. Idk if I’m going soft or what but this movie had me tearing up at multiple points throughout. Really great movie. Honestly, one of my favorite animated movies next to Into the Spiderverse.",0

It was really good and the kids were super engaged. ",0

This is probably THE best project I've ever been blessed to be a part of and seeing how much you love it makes it so wonderful. Thank you for watching and thanks for all the love. A LOT of talented people worked on this and it was certainly a project of passion. I chose this for family movie night. We were in fits. I didn't expect i'd be laughing so much. >!The furby scene!< was masterful, as was the >!end of wi-fi!<. I liked the father daughter stuff too. I can see us all watching it again. Plus, it was such a visual onslaught a rewatch might reward with things i might have missed Anyone else born in the mid to late 80s feel like this movie was made just for their (still) nerdy teen self with all the early 2000s references/memes? Furbies, Kill Bill, Numa Numa, Everybody Walk the Dinosaur, hell even the Sigur Ros song near the end, really hit me with that bittersweet nostalgia. Makes a ton of sense given how personal this project is and that Mike Rianda and Jeff Rowe are both in that same age range, as well. This was a phenomenal directorial debut for Michael Rianda, and its not a surprise to me in the least. He was a creative director for Gravity Falls.",0

2656,"I took a couple of semesters of History of Disability during undergrad and I‘m dying to discuss with my professor from those days. Planning to reach out to her via social media. This documentary covered so much of what she taught us - the asexuality assigned to a disabled person, the person being defined by their disability with little thought to their personhood. I found myself cheering along for passage of the bills, even though I know they’ve long since been enacted. Did y'all catch the part where the guy ran the camp was digging holes in the field... Omg I can't get over that 😂 playing a practical joke on the campers dude noooo! Was anyone else a blubbering mess for the last 15 minutes (capital crawl-credits) and then hours after? This documentary really had a profound impact on me.  I really yearn to see the same type of grassroots movements revived in American culture.  We are in desperate need of a cohesive, united coalition comprised of different groups and unions all working towards common goals for the greater good.  We need more people fighting for the rights of others, staying on deck until the job is done.  Loved every minute of this challenging, inspiring, and forceful film and every single person involved in the movement that made it into the film. Ya it had a much bigger emotional impact on me than I was expecting Can't agree more with the raves so far. It was so uplifting to see this film during these trying times. Am I the only one that wishes they had picked a different name for the title? Lmao I almost missed that 💀 The scene of them crawling up the steps was very powerful. Out of curiosity, did you need to search for it on Netflix or was it featured? I had to search to find it. ""Crip"" is sometimes a term used in disability movements as a reclaimed term by folks. Is that the part of the title that you wished was different? I just finished it. Had to search for it. I had searched for it about a month ago after hearing about the showing at a film festival but it said “coming soon.” I knew to look for it today only because Barack Obama’s Instagram post, not because Netflix recs. It was the main featured film on my Netflix today, so it's being pushed for some. Yeah. I didn't know it was a reclaimed term though. Guess I'll start thinking of it as such Not sure why Netflix wouldn’t push this on release day, given the excellent reviews and having Obama name tied to it. ",0
2657,"I heard about it a month or two ago and set a reminder for myself. Yea, I'm not an expert on reclamation, but as I understand it, it's best not to use it unless you are of the community? Not sure if other people know more and can chime in.",0
2658,Would you pay more taxes for it?,1
2659,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good they were able to do in a short amount of time for each character. They used really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc. ",0
2660,"Screenwriting genius, really.",0
2661,"Same with the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' thing. That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got us caught up in the background story; then, it gave us an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed us that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which THEN set up the stage for the reveal that incited him to attack Bucky later; AND THEN it showed what Tony Stark does in his downtime (inspire and fund clever kids and research); **AND THEN** it set the stage for the woman who confronted Tony and blamed him for the death of her son in a really clever way - she chided him with how easy it is for him to give away money and look good while causing grief and anguish on the other hand **AND AND THEN** it influenced his decisions with the regulation issue at the same time!",0
2662,"I mean, seriously. This was all in the span of, what, 4 or 5 minutes, tops? These two scenes, and many others in the film, managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff at the same time (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) at once, and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.",0
2663,I really feel that this movie is going to serve as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. They've really done something remarkable here.,0
2664,"It's very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting over the past decade. Dean Pelton of MIT with the self cooking hotdog, denator located in the meat shaft.Thank you, Russo Bros. when you realize zemo's listening to a phone recording and not actually on the phone with his wife. that was a great character beat.  That look on Buckey's face when Spider-Man stopped his punch...  ",0
2665,"I mean, he is used to wreck face with that arm, even Cap can barely block it, and then THIS KID just grabs it mid-punch and not only completely stops it, but also turns it in his hand to examine it as it were a mannequin arm.  Never thought I would be attracted to Aunt May. The fact that Vision, a vibranium covered, synthetic super being, wears sweater vests in his down time is fabulous  This was probably the best performance from RDJ as Tony Stark since the original Iron Man. The way how his cockiness and security steadily disappears throughout the movie. And when he is watching the video of his parents' death, I remembered what a great actor RDJ can be. The final 20 minutes or so is probably the most emotionally engaged I have been my any Marvel film. ""You're Spider-Boy?""",0

I love that they didn't just make it about body counts, but actually showed that people with lives and goals were killed because of them. I really empathized with Tony there and had to reconsider the way I felt about it all. Absolutely fantastic writing all around. Seeing Bucky murdering Tony's parents was painful.",0
2675,"Especially the way he kept punching Howard. This is a character we've seen in a few different films in supporting and minor roles and he is just brutally murdered.

If not, his only superpower is his metal arm and anything else Zola did to him which makes his actions all that more impressive. The fact for a split second you actually think that Cap is gonna go for Tony's face with the shield is a testament to the Russo brother's directing. Obviously in hindsight it would never happen (for one thing we know Stark is going to be in Spiderman: Homecoming), but the direction and acting built up the emotional tension brilliantly.  I deleted all comments out of nowhere.  I love the subtext that Cap is still so old fashioned that of course he would write Tony a handwritten letter, because that's just what his generation would do.  Zemo's last line: ""did it?""",0

Wolverine's leap is the greatest shit ever  [removed] One of the best moments of the movie was when suddenly out of the blue, Laura started speaking Spanish and began fighting with Logan after being mute for more than half of the movie. You know I think that part where Logan tried to crash through the fence is the first I've ever seen that fail.  Normally the fence goes down like it was paid to lose. Magneto was right I loved all the subtle references that gave us a glimpse into the future; tigers are extinct, self-driving tractor trailers and the mass-consumption of corn syrup.  Patrick Stewart looked like he was enjoying the ""grumpy cheeky old bastard"" role so much, but Dafne Keen knocked it out of the park. Incredible acting.",0

I also loved how the very first 5 minutes of the movie were just so brutal and opened with him saying fuck. It was like a preview of things to come. I thought one of the saddest moments was when they're leaving the casino with all the people on the floor and Prof X weakly says ""I'm sorry. I'm very sorry."" Loved the final moments of Logan's life, when they called back to him and Xavier's final conversation. I'm paraphrasing here but Xavier said something along the lines of ""this is what I wanted for us, to have a home, being surrounded by the people who love you, you should take a moment and feel what it's like Logan, it's not too late for you"". So when Logan, on his dying breaths said ""huh, so that's what it feels like"" I was absolutely crushed.  It wasn't too late for him, after countless years of pain and suffering he finally experienced love even if it was just for a few fleeting moments. This is the perfect film to show why it's important that not every superhero movie should be about saving the world. The stakes felt more real here than in the other big movies. They took a big risk having such a young kid play such a pivotal role and it totally paid off. Dafne Keen was absolutely *phenomenal*. And for such a young actress!

When he was burying Professor Xavier and was having trouble speaking, I was about to lose it. Hugh Jackman is an incredible actor and captured that pain so perfectly.

2703,The trek across No Man's Land was so ridiculously detailed and horrifying. I liked how Mark Strong’s voice was all you heard and the camera starts to show him only from his boots Richard Madden's performance absolutely crushed me in all of two minutes. Rest In Peace to that one guy Schofield knocks down as he sprints through the 2nd battalion at Hindenburg Line since he never gets back up after that. How shitty the British trenches were compared to the concrete trench lives of the Germans... was a stark difference in morale to me. “This bloke over here thought it was Tuesday”,1
2704,"^^^^”sorry ^^^^sir” chekhov's milk My favorite shot in the movie was the movie. I loved how the movie had these big-name actors in there like Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch and Mark Strong, but you’d only see them for like a minute. It kinda “un-Hollywooded” it for me. In reality, you really would have only seen these commanding officers for like a minute, whereas in a typical Hollywood war movie you’d stick with them because, well, it’s a big A-lister. I FELT the desperation of Schofeld when he tries to silence that German soldier by putting his hand on his mouth. Goddamn. I’ve never heard an audience groan in unison quite like the hand in the corpse part. I think every person in my completely full theater did all at once. When was the last time that two movies in theaters at the same time would have made as nerve racking a double features as this and Uncut Gems? I really really really need a 30 or 60 minute making of special on this. I need to see how they did every shot. I know at least once they traded MacKay for a stuntman, probably more, and then snuck him back on the screen later. ",1
2705,"The amount of stuff going on behind the camera, and the actors still being able to deliver has me in fucking awe from a technical perspective. And that's not to mention the performances and how tense the entire movie was. That version of Wayfaring Stranger definitely deserves to win some awards That scene with the flares in the ruined town will stick with me for a while. Harrowing movie, but fantastic all around. Well that really lived up to the hype. I'm absolutely blown away. It keeps you glued to the screen the entire time. ",1
2706,The standout scene to me was the when the Corporal was at the end of his trip down the river and he goes quickly from floating peacefully among the white cherry blossom petals to desperately crawling over water-logged bodies to get out of the river. ,1

2708,10/10 The shot of Schofield running parallel to the trench while the first wave of troops sprinted toward the enemy was unbelievable. I’d pay full ticket price to watch that sequence alone. I really enjoyed this movie. There was so much I liked about it and so little I disliked. ,1
2709,"Favorite scene had to be when Will first gets on the truck >!after his friend's death, and the other soldiers are laughing and joking as friends. Will is heartbroken and hasnt had time to process everything, and he is just sitting there with an awful look on face, looking like he wants to burst out into tears!< .  Really powerful scene. Loved the small nods to other members of the British Empire! Seeing a few Sikh soldiers as well as Newfoundland being referenced was a nice touch The sequence where he climbs out the trench and straight up chops for about 300 yds is incredible. Those looked like real hits he was taking when he was running into fellow soldiers.  Reminded me of the Wonder Woman no-mans-land scene (but much, much better). Corporal Blake’s death had me shedding a few tears. They pulled him out of the burning plane the least he could have done was not stab them ""Now, fuck off Lance Corporal""",1
2710,"After Schofield went through hell and lost a friend, that had to be crushing to hear. At least the other Blake appreciated the lengths Schofield went through to get to him.",1
2711,"Also, the scene where Schofield woke up during the night and the lights/flares were going off has to be one of Roger Deakins' coolest use of light. He deserves another Oscar just for that sequence alone The ‘Make sure you have witnesses, some men just want the fight’ comment really had me believing that the Colonel would do something rash or ignore orders, even though no sane commander would do that.",1
2712,"Amazing film, extremely tense throughout.  The sense of danger and anxiety was felt throughout the entire movie. Dude was on the truck for maybe 100 yards lol They did such a great job of humanizing Schofield in the scene with the French woman and the baby. The fire burning created a cozy/safe environment and the tenderness between the two was really well done. He gets his second (or maybe third of fourth at this point) wind by being reminded of his wife and daughter and the departure with her looking up at him begging him to stay was heartbreaking. Maybe my favorite scene",1

At first you think Casey is just smart and knows how to act in this situation by telling the girls to not attack and behave etc. but by the end, and after we find out her past, you can realize she's probably saying all that because she has learned to just live with and accept these things and has been conditioned to just submit after all this time with her uncle. I like living in a world where Kanye West references Unbreakable and Unbreakable references Kanye West.  Lots of people are brushing off the Unbreakable tie-in at the end as a simple easter egg, or something tacked last minute onto a totally unrelated film in a cheap attempt to rouse the Unbreakable fan-base.",0

2728,I guess I Shyamalan'd myself. So at the end the 24th personality was pretty much like bruce Willis character in unbreakable right? Since he couldint be hurt. Also thats why he went to the train before changing right? I'm right about that correct? The girl who played Marcia had a really big butt. Just gonna leave this here.

2731,That twist tho. What an incredible experience. It honestly took a meh movie and made it one of my most memorable movie theater experiences ever. Makes you look at the entire movie again in a whole new way.  Never thought I would see the day where M. Night Shyamalan makes a more interesting superhero cinematic universe than DC. During the movie Hedwig says that Kanye West is his favorite artist and wants Casey to hear him.,0

2733,"Damn, Neil DeGrass, you just can't shut up about repressed Renaissance thinkers. Good God Lois stop calling Superman Clark when other people are around! Props to the generic mook that got close enough to get a headshot on Batman.",0
2734,"I mean, it didn't do anything, but that's closer than any minion so far. Pee in a jar and Jolly  Ranchers... That is all I loved the part in the beginning when Bruce is rolling through the destruction of the city and calls the guy who works in his building, tells him to get everybody out, and you see his expression as he peers outside to the ongoing devastation as if he'd been oblivious to it, like if Bruce didn't call him he would have just carried on doing whatever he was doing.  ""Bruce, listen to me now. It's Lois, it's Lois Lane, she's the key. Am I too soon? I'm too soon. You were right about him, you've always been right about him. Fear him. Find us Bruce, you have to find us.""  Did anyone else notice that they killed off Superman on Good Friday? Someone definitely played Arkham Knight while making that fight scene with Batman and those thugs. I liked that the guy who created Skynet created Cyborg.  I can imagine the day Snyder was sitting in his home and he had the big flash... ""MOTHER OF GOD, MARTHA IS BOTH BATMAN AND SUPERMAN'S MOTHER'S NAMES - FUCK ME SILLY, I SOLVED THE MOVIE"" Perry, I need a chopper to fly right into a superhero battle because feelings.

2738,"https://i.imgur.com/kQzPVht.gifv Jesse Eisenberg could've been the perfect Riddler My overall thoughts are that I cannot wait for a fan edit of this movie. In a vacuum most of the scenes in the movie were well shot and well acted. If they were just edited together with some semblance of flow and logic it would have been a damn good movie. Hands down this is some of the worst editing I have ever seen in a big budget movie.  In general I did like the film, but it has major structural issues.",0
2739," Lex Luthor's right hand woman reminded me of Mirage from The Incredibles.  I laughed so hard when Batman rips the sink off the wall. It was something straight out of WWE. So Lois Lane being everywhere is still a thing. I couldn't stop staring at the snot coming out of Lex's nose at the end. Chris Pine was great in this movie. Doomsday was just pissed that he had a butt and no dick. Did anyone else get injustice vibes from the flash cameo.  'You were right' , 'Lois is the key' felt very much like we're gonna get an injustice like superman in the future hopefully. Supes and WW spend 20 minutes fighting a monster. Then Batman shoots one grenade and has a look like ""I did good."" ""I'm one of your son's friends."" Lex Luther making it rain with pictures of Superman's mother! 😂",0
2740,"Honestly, she could have done a better job cleaning up the dog poo.  Just an observation.   One scene that really sticks with me is when [Cleo went to find Fermin at the karate training ground, and the odd martial arts teacher did the pose that he said only the strongest people could do... but Cleo did it with ease.] (#spoiler)   I took this as a sign that she had the internal strength to deal with everything she was going to experience throughout the rest of the film.",1
2741,"Anyways, completely immersive movie. So beautifully shot. My favorite of the year. I really enjoyed it. I read somewhere that this film was the director/creator’s “love letter to the women in his life.”",1
2742,"I am a woman, and a mother, so certain things I was able to understand and feel deeply.",1
2743,"I was raised by a maid in Venezuela, so I really connected with Cleo and how much she loved the kids, who in turn also loved her very much. Those women work very hard, for little pay, from sun up til sun down. Not a glamorous job, but a very important one.",1
2744,Several things I noticed....the whole concept of women being all alone...it was the women who ran the family. The husband just showed up when he felt like it. The fact that everyone babied the youngest child made me think of how women might have a bit of a hand in raising these “spoiled” men.,1
2745,"I was struck by the fact that even though the family claimed to love Cleo, they don’t treat her equally. In the scene where they are sitting in the bench eating ice cream, Cleo is standing while everyone is sitting. A sign of how her struggle and pain is unacknowledged. She is there to work.",1
2746,"The dogs throughout the film made me think of the loyalty of women, especially the maids. They put up with a lot of shit from their husbands/employers.",1
2747,"The ocean scene showed me that Cleo loved those kids enough to risk her own life for them. As I watched them bobbing up and down it made me think that the family (Cleo included) could weather any storm, as long as they were together.",1
2748,"I thought it was funny that the husband took the bookcases. What’s a bookcase without books? Nothing. Just empty space. The heart of the bookcase are the books.  The heart of the home is the family. The husband left and took only the empty shell, leaving behind the one thing that gave his life any value—his family. I saw this in theaters almost two weeks ago and I firmly believe that the *spoiler* the riot scene is one of the best shots of recent history. The way the riot breaks out through the window and then transitions into the inside of the mattress store all in one shot is masterful. I have never sobbed because of a movie before but Cleo's delivery scene reduced me to shambles. It wasn't just the fact that her baby girl was born dead, but the casual, almost anesthetized manner in which the doctors and nurses talked to her. I completely lost it when they asked Cleo if she would like to meet her daughter and then that it was time to say goodbye almost immediately after.   ",1
2749,"On a lighter note, one of my favorite shots was the single take, 360 degree pan of Cleo turning off all the lights in the house before going to bed. It was a beautiful, nuanced scene, showing all of the little things that servants do to keep a household running. We often forget how much work it takes to maintain a home, from doing the dishes to cleaning up after children and pets.  I watched this movie with my mother in theaters, and it was one of best bonding moments we had recently. She was raised near Colonia Roma, where this movie takes place. She cried three times in this movie. According to her, how this movie sets the 1970s setting was beautiful. She told me that watching this film was like watching a memory of hers play on the screen.  For the first half you’re like ok this is going to be a really well-shot art film slash character study then Cuarón is like bitch you thought I loved Cleo’s dynamic with little Pepe. He was such a sweetie. Also really liked how the mother had these outbursts and flaws but ultimately was such a kind, compassionate, and strong figure.  There's so many shots in this film that make you think ""How the hell did they pull this off?"" Not just the big, showy long takes, like the fire or the massacre. But the little things, too, like the reflection of an airplane framed perfectly in a puddle of water during the opening credits, or a little horned frog skittering along the ground in close-up.",1
2750,"This movie is filled with little touches like that, that make it feel real in every way. The way Cleo makes coffee, the way the movie theater is recreated, the way one character says to another that the Cowboys won the Super Bowl because the Baltimore Colts got cocky, then sticks to that statement even when reminded that Baltimore still won. Even the sound mix feels incredibly immersive. If you can't see this in a theater or even on a TV, make sure to watch it with headphones. This is clearly a passion project for Cuarón, and it shows.",1
2751,"Yes, I know I haven't talked about the story yet. It's a slowly-paced slice-of-life movie, with no big showy scenes until the last half-hour. And if you're not into that, you probably won't like it as much. But while it has nowhere near the tension of Cuarón's last two films (and really, which films do?), it's still a great screenplay about domestic life, women's struggles, class issues, political turmoil, childhood, and the movies, and that's just off the top of my head. ",1
2752,"If the ending didn't land for you, for me it can be summed up by the inscription that appears at the end of the credits. ""Shantih Shantih Shantih"" (please tell me if I get the following explanation horribly wrong). It's a Sanskrit mantra that also appears at the end of T.S. Eliot's ""The Waste Land"", and is a prayer used to signify the end of an Upanishad. It represents peace, rest, calmness, tranquility, or bliss. There's some big changes going on, in Cléo's life, in the family, and in the world, but everything's gonna be all right. She's at peace with everything that's happened to her over the course of the year. Shantih Shantih Shantih. I knew something bad was going to happen to Celo's baby when her glass broke for the toast.  It's very hard as a Mexican to describe Roma. It's a love letter to Mexico, encapsulated in Mexico City. It's a letter to the country we are, from the tenderss of our abuelitas to the oppressive regime we had for 70 years and now threatens to return. The upper classes shooting guns in the woods and the lower classes living in the slums of Neza. Going for a baby crib and being a witness of incredible repression from the government.",1
2753,What we are. For better or worse,1
2754,"But most of all, Roma is the most loving letter to women and the loneliness that can result from feeling abandoned, like Sofia said ""at the end, us women are alone"" this doesn't mean that as a gender they have gained tremendous ground but at the end of it, a lot of our moms can mirror themselves in Sofia and Cleo.  Whle Sofia was a mess her husband was bumping shoulders with his lover, while Cleo made a long trip to see Fermin, he was literally kung fu fighting.",1
2755,"And at the end, Cleo had the love of her kids (because they were as much as Sofias) to power through, and Cuaron ends it with ""Para Libo"" which was his Cleo.",1
2756,"I didn't see a better film this year. It deserves every bit of praise and I don't see how Cuaron can lose best director. The first shot of this movie is what film is all about. Cuaron managed to make a maid cleaning dog shit be the most beautiful intro to a film I've seen in a long time. I remember it was really quiet and I was a bit like ""okay....floor shot for awhile I guess"" but as soon as it clicked what was going on I was fucking in. FUCK this movie is so beautiful. The symbolism in this film was incredible. As a son coming from a split family, the shot of the Cleo and the family sitting silently eating ice cream after announcing what their father did, with a wedding in the backdrop, had me in tears. Made me admire the beauty that love pushes on regardless of the loss of it, that it isn't as singular an emotion as we can selfishly think. I just wanted someone to take that poor dog for a walk. y'all saw those two ducks having sexual intercourse  “When I was older I used to be a sailor, but I drowned in a storm…” In time I might be able to adequately organise my thoughts about why *Roma* is the best movie I’ve seen in god-knows-how-long, but for now I’ll  say that I got a real kick out of Cuaron including that scene from *Marooned*, which was basically *Gravity* before *Gravity*. I wish I could have found out what this movie was about before watching it with my 4 month pregnant wife. I think it's absolutely amazing how much this movie sounds like the real Mexico City. You can put your head out of a window at anytime during the day and you'll most certainly hear a guys selling honey, the loud-as-fuck cart selling sweet potatoes, the garbage truck with the guy who walks by with the bell, all of them were, and still are, part of this city. A day Downtown actually sounds like in the movie with all the street vendors yelling trying to get peoples attention. It really sounds like the actual Mexico City, it's amazing.",1
2757,"Everyone's talking about Cleo, but the scene that really got me was the scene with Sofia and the kids at the restaurant near the end.",1
2758,"The day my father left, my mom took me to a restaurant and, just like in the movie, she told me, with a smile on her face and a look that was a mix of fear and bravery, that from now on it would only be the two of us and that things would be better. And they were. Just because of her. I love my mom Fuck Fermín I found Roma absolutely incredible. The best filmgoing experience I’ve had this year, maybe one of the best ever. It’s so hard for me to describe what made this special to me, but I think it comes down to just how alive it was. It was a little slice of a normal, happy and sad life of Cleo, and the people around her.",1
2759,"There’s so much to unpack in this, but what really stood out was the acting, direction, sound design and especially cinematography. Roma represents Cuarón at his best and most confident as a storyteller, and the intimacy of Roma is almost too hard to bear.",1
2760,"I do want to touch on the hospital scene, though. It’s the tensest I’ve been in the cinema in a long time, and it was all done in masterfully choreographed single-angle takes that ended up lasting well beyond several minutes. When I saw the liveless little baby body, I broke down, harder than I think I’ve ever done at a film. The brutality of seeing the doctors cover the child in the background while Cleo was still in her birthgiving position was too much to handle.",1
2761,"When she finally makes peace with herself at the beach, saying that she didn’t really want the child, and the family all hug her, it almost hit me even more than the hospital. The fact that she realised that she has more love from the family than she could ever need, and that she loves them just as much was the perfect wrap-up of such a beautiful character arc.",1
2762,"Roma is a masterpiece. I can’t wait to see it again. I had to call both my parents after seeing it. It reminds you (much like Children of Men) of what a precious gift life is, and that each one matters as much as the next one.  I guess its good that I saw on netflix and not in theaters cause I hate crying in public and walking around after crying. I don't know if anyone else had this experience, but it took a good 30-45 minutes for me to fall into rhythm with Roma. Saw it in theaters and by an hour in I was 100% with Cuarón. Definitely going to see it again, so I can let the movie and the longer scenes fully wash over me.",1
2763,"Also, as many have said, the sound design was exquisite. I thought people behind me were whispering. I turned around ready to shush them. It turned out to be the children in the movie whispering off-screen.  What an incredible work of art. For something relatively small-scale, it feels so *big.* Focusing on this little microcosm of characters living their lives against change and heartache gives it this gravitas that I can't quite pin down. Cuaron's direction is sublime, and the actors are so good it doesn't feel like they're acting.",1
2764,That beach scene near the end. So powerful and cathartic. ,1
2765,"**Watch this movie with people you love.**  Honestly, that birth/dead birth scene is one of the biggest gut punches I have ever seen. Shot brilliantly in this one take and with so much emotion coming out of Yalitza Aparicio.",1
2766,A neorealistic masterpiece,1
2767,"Yeah, I'd have jumped out of that fucking window too. anyone else think the scene where toni and her son are arguing and suddenly their both wet with paint thinner really intense What about the gallery opening though When Peter goes into shock after the accident, parks the car, and goes to his bed, I got this intense, awful feeling that I was going to have to witness the discovery of Charlie's body. I didn't want them to show it. I wanted that whole scene to be over. And I maintained that feeling as the camera stayed on Peter's frozen face in bed, hearing Annie leave the house, and eventually the scream. It was terrible and unnerving. Did anybody else notice the moment where Joanie said ""Every member of the family has to be in the house"", they ADR'd ""house"" over her originally saying ""room""? Everyone talking about Toni Collette’s performance (and rightly so)... but damn if Alex Wolff doesn’t deserve as much praise...the aftermath of the accident, getting owned at the dinner table... a very commendable performance all round",0
2768,Edit: Fuck it ... I thought everyone was great in this actually.. Gabriel Byrne with the F bombs was some much needed levity I knew Charlie was no good when she ate the Hershey’s bar like a fucking psycho.  This movie is the greatest anti pot PSA ever Toni Collette was giving me some serious Shelly Duvall a la The Shining vibes. The pure terror and raw feeling when she’s standing at the foot of Peter’s bed during her sleep walking dream was so captivating and also so horrifying! The poor dad was so concerned with it being cold and people being chilly and then dies from being set on fire. At least the cold can't bother him or his loved ones now.  Did anyone else think Peter was going to have his eyes gouged out? There seemed to be a lot of imagery hinting at that. Paraphrasing here:,0

[deleted] People seem to be arguing over whether Hereditary is a more of a traditional horror film or a psychological thriller but I personally think it's a groundbreaking addition to the ""fucking upsetting"" genre of film. As a fan of this genre I was not disappointed.  This movie went from 0-100 real quick with Peter and Charlie in the car What unnerved me the most was the brief shot of Annie on the ceiling, beating her head into the attic door after Peter locked himself in. I'll be seeing that on my head when I go to sleep tonight Did anyone notice that when Peter was in the attic and Annie was banging her head on the attic door, that she immediately stopped after he said ""I'm sorry""? I found that kind of cool since she had been waiting for him to apologise for Charlie's death for a long time.  Who else had idiots clicking in their theatre?",0
2803,"I’m just here to talk about the Bill Nye the Science Guy cameo. I imagine that watching Mank without any previous knowledge of Citizen Kane and the social circles of contemporary Hollywood will be like watching Avengers Endgame without having seen anything else from the MCU. It’s for insiders. It relies on the audience’s repertoire to work. And in this case, that makes for some sort of elitist film (that’s not a critique, just a statement of fact).",1
2804,"The movie is rigid to the point of becoming dull, except for a few sequences when it comes to life, usually relying on the impact of the dialogues, that are well-written and theatrical, but not strong enough to turn the film into an insightful character study. For instance: a lot is said about politics, but the script never addresses the roots of Mank’s political ideology or, for that matter, any of his personality traits and relationships (or lack of). No wonder Amanda Seyfriend is being hailed as the MVP, since she’s the only one that establishes some meaningful connection with Mank and adds a much needed humanity to his character.",1
2805,"Overall, it’s form over substance, and that’s also true when it comes to Fincher’s directorial choices (his attempt to replicate the aesthetics of the time eventually works against the movie, like the obvious script headings leading to flashbacks). As an admirer of Citizen Kane and a movie-buff, I was eager to love Mank, but, IMO, it’s just too bland, too empty to even earn a spot amongst Fincher’s best. gary oldman and amanda seyfried are supposed to be the same age in this I'm in the minority it seems, as this fell flat for me. The technical aspects all work well - direction, acting, etc. - but the storytelling and the structure just never reeled me in at all, and I couldn't help think by the end (despite knowing what it's about): what was the point? Some of you who like Hollywood during this time period might enjoy the Pat Hobby short stories by F. Scott Fitzgerald: http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks04/0400821h.html",1
2806,"It's about a washed-up screenwriter trying to survive. One of the stories features Orson Welles. Amanda Seyfried steals every scene she is in, those eyes really pop in black and white Gary Oldman is a fantastic actor but he did NOT look like someone who was supposed to be in his 40s whatsoever. My favourite scene was the first dinner party, the one with Charlie Chaplin at the piano. The back-and-forth argument about politics was perfectly directed.",1
2807,"The first half of the movie was well constructed, I was surprised that only an hour had passed. The second half was very messy, it was clear that the script had been reworked so that the narrative reflected the 2016 presidential election. Mank becoming Hollywood Bernie Sanders felt like a stretch of reality. Technically amazing, with great performances, but the movie failed to connect with me on any other level. Dense script, that asks to rewatch the movie, but i din’t think i will. Just felt a little cold. Like some movies you connect with, and some you look through the window from the outside. That was the latter.",1
2808,"And i just can’t wrap my head around Fincher going as far as to record/mix the audio to emulate films of the time, Reznor and Ross recording entirely period-appropriate soundtrack, but shooting it on digital and in widescreen?

Looking back I see the subtext there but the ending speech and title card made it wildly explicit out of nowhere.  Left me less high on the movie than I was up until that point. Enjoyable trip through the period and the dialogue felt sharp enough that I sometimes wondered if Aaron Sorkin had wrote the screenplay, but there didn't seem a real point to anything? ",1
2814,"Considering what the movie's billed as, there's almost no detail about Mank's relationship with Hearst or Marion Davies. I guess his friend's death was suppose to be his rosebud but it was hard to care when the film spent no time with the character beforehand. ",1
2815,"And there was no climax, no drama about whether the film would be made or not. I kept waiting for that moment that would flip the film into a different gear and it never came. Felt like we were still in the middle of act two when it just... ends. Tom Burke sounded exactly like Orson Welles. I enjoyed the movie but wish we got more of him and Mank interacting in person. Does Fincher hate Orson Welles or what? Because I can't really understand that ending unless there are some deeply embedded personal feelings about Welles. ",1
2816,Welles throwing a tantrum + the cutting of Welles and Mank's acceptance speeches to make it seem like this was more than just a playful exchange between two colleagues was a really bizarre end that didn't work with the film I had just watched for two hours.,1
2817,"I enjoyed large parts of this and thought it was maybe Oldman's career best work. But that ending felt totally out of place. I think I loved this movie? I loved the (inaccurate, I know) discussions of old Hollywood politics. I loved the Kane-esque structure. I loved the score, Reznor and Ross should change up their style/instrumentation more often? ",1
2818,"One thing I loved about Oldman’s performance is that his aloofness becomes more strained as the world around him becomes more serious. I’d bet most actors’ instinct would be to drop the aloofness as time goes on, but Oldman lets you see him struggle to keep it up.",1
2819,"My only real complaint is the false artifacts inserted in the “film”. It was infrequent and mechanical, and took me out of the scene instead of drawing me into the time period. Anyone else really impressed by Lily Collins in this? Seyfried will get all the attention for awards, but I really loved Collins and her character and wish she had more screentime in this.",1
2820,"Louis B Mayer was also easily the funniest character in the movie. (Long-form thoughts!) I think *Mank* is a good movie, but it didn't feel like it was pushed to the Fincher Standard. There's a ton to like on a technical level. It was beautifully shot, the acting across the board was top-notch, and it was interesting to hear a Reznor/Ross score that reached way back instead of their usual sound. And even the script, though as meandering as a script can get, has some awesome dialogue.",1
2821,"Even some of the history was nicely done. William Randolph Hearst would often seat the guests he found most intriguing nearest him and getting sat away was akin to being demoted. So to see Mank near the center at the beginning of the film, then off at the very edge at the end was a nice little show of just how far Mank had fallen.",1
2822,"Everything else was a confusion of subplots vying for dominance. I kept mentally comparing *Mank* to *The Aviator* the entire time, which was also about a film auteur who fell from grace. I had never seen *Hell's Angels*, but Scorsese was able to integrate enough of the film and even show enough of its production to drive home why it was of personal importance to Hughes in context. Not just because of the subject matter, but there were real stakes if he failed.",1
2823,"*Mank* takes a similar approach, but frequently gets distracted. Mank's relationship with Hearst is supposed to be the inciting incident for his agreement to take on *Citizen Kane*, but he's in all of two or three scenes with Hearst. We never really see a relationship build until it's already deteriorated. It's also supposed to be about him butting heads with Orson Welles, but we don't see this until literally the end of the third act.",1
2824,"It also tries to be about Mank's antagonistic relationship with the higher-ups at MGM, but we never see him *do anything*. That dovetails into the plotline involving Mayer and Upton Sinclair that honestly felt out of place in the grand scheme of things. I know it's supposed to help draw out Mank's commitment to principle over all else, but the cynical side of me felt like that entire plotline was there to allow for yet another instance of someone all but looking into the camera and making an uninteresting connection between Nazi Germany and modern politics. I understand the script was written years ago by Fincher's father, but there's just no way that particular point wasn't sharpened for Netflix.",1
2825,"But I think the biggest sin that the movie commits is that it has absolutely *no* interest in giving us any insight into the development of *Citizen Kane*. It doesn't show anything. It barely shows Orson. Their clash comes so late it's pretty much relegated to the epilogue. In that sense, a great deal of *Mank* feels like one of those low-budget unauthorized biopics, where they have absolutely no rights to the original film. We can't connect Mank to his own work, unlike how Scorsese was able to connect Hughes to *Hell's Angels*, *Scarface*, and even the construction of the *Hercules*. Mank gets drunk in the Mojave Desert and finishes the script off-screen.",1
2826,"*Mank* pretty much feels like a companion piece to *Citizen Kane*, and that's kinda frustrating because it should be able to stand on its own. And it has so much to say about all sorts of things that never really coalesce, so it also doesn't feel like it even succeeds at being a good biography. Like, when the character that's barely in the movie talks about how Mank sponsored her entire German village to allow them entrance into the US. *Where was that stuff?* That sounds crazy and interesting, and really plays into Mank's commitment to principle better than the Sinclair stuff. It was a play against Nazi Germany but also, by extension, against MGM because they refused to stop showing films there--which was beyond problematic for Mank, being Jewish himself. But that's all pushed into a throw-away line by a character who had no other reason to be there but to deliver that line.",1
2827,"So as-is, *Mank* was great on a technical and acting level. But everything involving plot and character feel like afterthoughts. So we're left with an alcoholic protagonist who cheats on his wife and leaves her to fend for herself back in NY, and, after being slighted by no one in particular, decides to punch up at the establishment by writing a movie off-screen. I know this was a passion project for Fincher, so that's that, but I feel like there was such potential here for something more epic. This movie is rose colored glasses for old Hollywood and much like any sort of lense it magnifies an image and refracts it; showing all the scars and blemishes of a bygone era but much at the same time romanticizing it. Fincher has this modern way of looking at old but important movie with such new eyes, in a way that one would argue that it seems like history repeating itself. Some would possibly find the political message in the film to be exhausting especially with the modern climate but it's all to magnify the relationship of the main character whose riddled with vices and flaws but none more so than the burden of Wit. Which the main character and the screenwriting shares ten fold. The score and sound ripped straight from the aforementioned bygone era that I can't help but watch and marvel. ",1
2828,"10/10 Fantastic and flawless in delivery and tone that I am remissed to give it a score any lower Love Fincher, love Gary Oldman, and  I love Citizen Kane...but I just didn't get this one. Story wise I feel like it focused on some of the least interesting aspects of one of the most interesting making-of stories in the history of cinema. The ""washed-up alcoholic screenwriter"" character is kind of overdone...it's hard to bring anything new to that type of portrayal, even when their background is so rich. Not enough screentime for any of the characters/actors I was looking forward to seeing (Charles Dance, Amanda Seyfield...a disappointing lack of Orson Welles). Great acting, and the actual dialogue was some of the smartest and most well paced I've seen all year. I loved the lighting and the coloring, but overall visually I thought the movie looked a bit bland. 5/10. Did anyone else catch that Upton Sinclair was played by Bill Nye? Kind of random. The film has a monaural audio-track which sounds beautifully authentic, film-grain and cigarette marks that often look surprisingly genuine, and yet it was all shot digitally with 8K cameras, framed entirely in widescreen. There are some great performances throughout (even if they did fuck Orson over) but I can't get over how glossy some of those images looked, and CGI animals? Please... It's a pretty contradiction. Fincher is more concerned with being a digital technician than a filmmaker here. Hopefully he makes a return to form on his next one, although it's starting to seem like nothing will ever knock Zodiac off its throne. Great on the technical and acting front, but I couldn’t connect to a single character and struggled to finish this.",1
2829,"Love Fincher’s work, and I hope he’s scratched his artsy itches, because I need that third season of Mindhunter. Wishful thinking, I know. Saw this a few weeks ago and have been dying to talk about it.  As a die hard Fincher and Citizen Kane fan, I came in with relatively low expectations for this. I love Fincher in part for how obsessed he is with the perverse, fucked up parts of our world, and a story about a screenwriter’s creative struggles just felt totally disconnected from his other work. But this movie actually feels very much of a piece with the cool, slick nature of the rest of his work. ",1
2830,"This is a movie about smart guys making good work, an obvious obsessive point with Fincher, but it weirdly feels like his warmest work yet. This movie is spectacular. I love the sharp, witty dialogue of Mank, and the political paralells, though kind of obvious, are effectively thought provoking. Overall, I’m just happy to see Fincher make a movie again. Here’s hoping Netflix lets him make even more. I could not buy Gary Oldman as a man in his 40s and Tuppence Middleton was lovely but their age difference was distracting. Amanda Seyfried is so hot in this!",1
2831,"Seems like a weird thing to mention, but every time she was on-screen she was magnetic.",1
2832,"Probably the most wholesome movie I’ve seen in a long long time. Thought the whole film was perfect overall, but the visuals to me stood out so much. Loved the different sequences like Aunt Lucy touring through the pop up book and the prison turning luxurious. 10/10 It's a shame that every time I tell someone that I really enjoyed the first Paddington I get a confused reaction of ""what that movie is actually good? Yeah, ok."" And now I just got out of the second one and they somehow one-upped it and made quite frankly a perfect charming family film that is honestly leagues above the rest. ",0
2833,This film is just so heartwarming and smart in both its humor but the way in executes it while also incorporating its themes. The whole cast knocks it out of the park and Hugh Grant is having the time of his life in this villainous role. He charms the hell out of it. ,0
2834,"It seems like many are willing to just assume this is another ""stupid kids movie"" but please go and support some genuinely great entertainment that's right for viewers of all ages. I really liked the first Paddington quite a bit, so I'm floored that I enjoyed this one even more. What's not to love, the movie has so much charm. Did anyone else think it was pretty dark when [Paddington accepted his potential death underwater?](#spoiler) The first Paddington film along with it's sequel are rare examples of a Live-Action adaptation of a beloved children's character done right. I wish the same could be said for the upcoming Peter Rabbit film by Sony. ",0
2835,"Hell, I wish the same studio (StudioCanal) that made the Paddington films would have gotten their hands on doing a Live-Action Peter Rabbit film that was as faithful and cute as this before Sony gotten hold of it. It's such a missed opportunity considering how beautiful and good the characters are drawn especially in Watercolor. Especially since Peter Rabbit is one of my childhood icons.",0
2836," Edit: Turns out it was Framestore and not Studiocanal that did the Paddington films. Incredible movie. The writing is insanely tight, I couldn't believe how many setups and callbacks there were and how well the entire movie folded together. Hugh Bonneville and Hugh Grant both turned in top notch performances in this film, and the rest of the cast was really solid too. Some of the scenes were absolutely gorgeous to look at, and the whole thing just really captured a wonderful spirit.",0
2837,"I can't remember the last time a movie made me laugh and cry quite as hard as this did. To anyone who dismisses this as ""just a kid's movie"" I implore you to check it out. If you look for the good in this film, you'll find it.  This was like ""The Shape of Water"", but for kids. I love the original so much, and this was even better. The direction, the visuals, the humor, Hugh Grant...it was all so perfect. And Paddington's beautiful spirit of decency and thoughtfulness resonated strongly through the whole thing. ",0
2838,"I knew exactly where the ending was going a couple of minutes before it got there but I still had to fight like hell to hold back tears.  Once again, hilarious and heartfelt, I might even prefer it to the first film honestly. The prison sequences reminded me a lot of The Grand Budapest Hotel in a very good way, with a downright hilarious performance by Brendan Gleeson as that big ol' hardened softie at his core Knuckles (seriously the man is a treasure - never had a bad performance in anything). ",0
2839,"Set design was some of the best of the year; love it when kids films don't slum on the technical elements. Costumes great too,  especially Hugh Grant's ever more ridiculous array of thespian garments. ",0
2840,I think above all though one has to love these films for imbuding such a earnestness and joy to its humour and emotional beats. You really grow to care for ol' Paddington and the Browns in the way I fear the upcoming adaptation of Peter Rabbit will forget to do.,0
2841,"9/10. I almost lost it when he was underwater with the mom...then tears of joy when he opened the door for his aunt. Great movie, even for a 24 year old punk rocker... Who else was crying at the end? If Paddington 🐻👒🏷 💼 and my girl👸🏼😍 both drowning😱🌊 and I can only save one😤😬 Catch me at my girl funeral😔👻🌹 wit tha fresh marmalade🥪 🍊  What was Knuckles McGinty in prison for?",0
2842,"My headcanon is that he was a member of the IRA. It's rare to watch a film where everybody involved is clearly having a fantastic time, with so much love going into everything on screen, and, better yet, the end product is of extremely high quality. Take everything that you hate about how film studios handle much-loved material as they translate it from cartoon or book to film; how they handle sequels/reboots or live-action adaptations, and Paddington 2 is the perfect, polar opposite of that.",0
2843,"It's funny, charming, colourful; it displays great changes in tempo, memorable characters and an emotionally rewarding story. I was taken aback at times by how good the film was to look at, almost prettier than it has any right to be. Someone in this thread used the word ""wholesome"" and that's absolutely spot on. Cannot recommend it enough. Hugh Grant was dynamite especially on the mid-credit scene 100%? what kind of cinematic masterpiece is this? I noticed that all the previews before the movie started had fart and butt jokes. I rolled my eyes every time thinking what have children’s movies come to nowadays? But both Paddington films are great examples of what a child’s film can accomplish. Such fantastic films.  Rotten tomatoes links to Insidious. paddington 2 was fucking litty fam my boi paddington straight up became king of the pen with just some flame ass marmalade sammiches Haven’t felt like that leaving a family film in a long time. Hysterical yet moving and beautifully told. A true delight. Just wish people would take me seriously when I tell them “Paddington 2 is a masterpiece” it does sound like a joke, but it’s the truth.  This was one of the cutest movies I've seen in a long time. I especially liked the little details i.e. Knuckle's sandwiches, and the paper he was reading in prison was called ""The Hard Times""",0
2844,"Fun fact: The original stuffed Paddington bear was invented by Jeremy Clarkson's mother, which Jeremy still has. Man was this movie good. I expected another light hearted movie but got so much more. It made me laugh, happy, sad, and then gave me tears of joy. That single “Happy Birthday Aunt Lucy” and then hug scene made me tear up. I thought I’d never cry of happiness! 100% is what this movie we’ll deserves! I recommend it for everyone to watch. The release of *Paddington 2* is a bigger deal to me than the next installment of Star Wars or Marvel or what have you. Even though I am a grown man, *Paddington* is my favorite movie. I was cautious about spoilers for months and wore my duffle coat to an late night showing the night before release day in the US. I am happy to report that I loved *Paddington 2* even with all that anticipation. ",0
2845,"*Paddington 2* continues the same standard of excellence set by its predecessor for rich visuals, character animation, and clever wit.  Generally speaking, the movie is a colorful feast for the eyes with neat uses of animation and effects throughout. The pop-up sequence in the beginning is marvelous. There is broad and subtle humor in abundance, and it is evident that filmmakers have mastery of both. Rather than go through every gag I liked, suffice it to say that every joke landed for me; there is just so much good comic material. Some highlights that immediately come to mind are the marmalade making scene, Paddington's mishap in the barbershop, and the hilarious mid-credits musical number.",0
2846,"I continue to be impressed by how well Paddington is animated. The character animators succeeded yet again at making Paddington cute, funny, and sympathetic. For that matter, all of the bears are well animated and seamlessly composited into the live action footage. Once again Ben Whishaw is perfect as Paddington's voice. He was a great find back when Colin Firth dropped out of the first movie. Whishaw is so good it feels like should have been in that role from the get-go; I can't imagine a better voice for Paddington. High marks also for the other actors, especially Hugh Grant who expertly walks that line between menace and comedy just like Nicole Kidman did in the first one.",0
2847,"This sequel is even more of a tearjerker than the first movie. I sobbed during Paddington's arrival at prison and the silent underwater goodbye between Mrs. Brown and Paddington when they briefly resign themselves to his fate before reinforcements arrive to help rescue him in the nick of time. A few other scenes also made me tear up. With all the comedy and the melancholy, it is quite the emotional roller coaster, in a good way. ",0
2848,"Of course, I got all choked up again for the ending, but those were happy tears. What a perfect ending it is. I thought it was a good choice to end the film right there on a tender note rather than trying to tack on an additional peppy scene.",0
2849,"And finally, the music. The soundtrack has already taken up residence in my regular listening rotation where it is sure to stay, just like that of the first movie. The return of the diegetic calypso band was not unexpected but certainly welcome, with a new set of tunes I thoroughly enjoyed.",0
2850,"Now there are two movies I call my favorite, and they both star a darling little bear from Darkest Peru. *Paddington 2* is as good a sequel as I could have asked for. Heartwarming, wholesome fun. Just perfect. 10 jars of marmalade out of 10. I was totally blind-sided by this cos the opening scene made me cry. I think I've cried in a cinema maybe once before. I am 25 and was in the theatre alone. Absolutely wild.  It made me laugh so hard when the guard from the first film showed back up and get fooled again by a man in disguise My family rolled squad deep to this and we all loved it. Hugh Grant is a riot as a British Count Olaf, the visuals were tremendous, and the story was again heartfelt, fun, and genuine. Bring your family to this movie, my old man was laughing just as hard as my 10 year old sister.",0
2851,"""This isn't real enough for you, Billy? *I'm* not real enough for you?",0
2852,"It was real enough for Georgie!""",0
2853,"Low blow, Pennywise. I liked how when Georgie laughed really hard at the pop! pop! pop! popcorn impression that IT does, like REALLY laughed and wasn't afraid at all for a second, IT just totally 'went offline' and stalled and one eye wandered. Like he entertained the kid a little TOO well and created joy and love and it shut him down for a second. one thing that took me by surprise tone-wise with this movie is that Muschietti really turned it into kind of a dark fantasy adventure movie instead of a gritty horror flick. it had a certain fairytale element to it that I thought was stupid in Mama but really worked in IT. just an immensely enjoyable film, tons of fun. The way the shot centered on Pennywise's face when he was dancing in the lair was so fucking unsettling. Of all the losers, the standout in my opinion was Sophia Lillis as Bev. She really nailed the interpretation of her I had from the book, that mixture of brassy confidence and maturity for her age with her, I guess, demons - an overly handsy father and her reputation as a slut (something not in the book, and a change I liked). The scene were she joins them at the quarry and the boys just stare at her while she suntans is great. And holy fuck, her father was so incredibly creepy. The scene where he locks her in their apartment and confronts her is just...there's no Pennywise (till the end) but it's so tense. I was surprised (and impressed) how far they took that subplot from the book.",0
2854,"Hamilton as Bowers was really good! His whole gang was underused, and I was disappointed with their being no payoff for Vic and Belch, and with Patrick just being a more...generic bully, but the scene were Bowers kills his father, being egged on by the TV, is outstanding. ",0
2855,"And finally, Skarsgård. He was amazing as Pennywise. He did his own thing with the character. He really nailed my interpretation of him from the book, that despite being a malevolent being thousands of years old he's a child in many ways, and a spoiled one whose had his way with Derry for so long. Watching him break down as the Losers fight back is so cathartic. He comes off as an emotionally stunted pedophile in many ways.  I like how Pennywise grabbed the kid with the broken arm and twice pretended like he was going to bite his arm off.  Georgie's death scene was a lot more brutal than I expected. Good Lord ""I need my bifocals. They're in my second fanny pack"" ",0
2856,"Line of the movie That garage projector scene was some of the most intense shit I've seen in a long damn time. I jumped out of my fucking seat when Pennywise popped through the projector  The television kids show sequences. ""Come play in the sewers!"" Good god, those were creepy.  Can we take a moment to appreciate how much effort they went to in referencing the book, even when it didn't serve the story?",0
2857,"They had Silver. They had The Black Spot. They had the Paul Bunyan statue. They had the turtle. They had the deadlights. There were just so many small details that showed a real love and respect for the source material. Seems like they kept Mike in the story just for that gun. Holy shit that weird tracking shot of Pennywise dancing that focused on his head was super wacky. My favorite scene was the part where Ben was flipping through the pages of the history book and the librarian was just lurking creepily at the back not moving at all. I expected her to transform into Pennywise any second.  That Lois Lane line was vile. The entire theater groaned at that one. The worst thing about this movie is that it's really hard to google anything about it because of the title. I love the scene where Pennywise is just casually eating a child's arm, stops, and then uses the arm to wave at the kids. ""This town used to be a beaver trapping camp""",0
2858,"""It still is boys, am I right??""  Bill finally realizing after the entire movie that Georgie is dead and there is nothing that he can do about it was crushing. A surprisingly heartwarming film about how a clown helps a group of kids overcome their fears and realize the power of friendship. Great for the whole family.  The jumpcut to close ups of the New Kids on the Block poster, the acknowledgement from Ben and Bev, and then the cut back to the ominous tone was so weird, yet I absolutely loved it.",0
2859," ""You'll float too. You'll float too. YOU'LL FLOAT TOO"" as Georgie's voice changes and his face decays. Nightmare fuel!

2860,"Also, “W-would you be scared to go to Uganda..?” A+ work Amy The entire cast was hilarious, but Boat Party guy and Billie Lourd were on another level. I also lost it at “you can make yourself come...WITH YOUR MIND?!” I only learned today that Beanie Feldstein is Jonah Hill’s sister, and now I can’t believe I didn’t see it before, their facial features/mannerisms are super similar That trio of the karaoke, pool scene, and the immediate aftermath scene was absolutely amazing.

2861,Worth the price of admission alone for me. ,0
2862,"The slow build of confidence for Amy, followed by the euphoric rush of going into the pool that felt like it was going to be the climax followed by the immediate crushing blow.

The single take walk through the house followed by one of the best shot arguments I've seen in a long time. ",0
2863,"Wow, Olivia Wilde is gonna do amazing things. I think my favorite thing about this movie is how kind it feels.",0
2864,"That may seem like a weird term to use, but what I mean is that all of the characters are written and portrayed with so much empathy. There are no stereotypical bully characters or mean girls or dumb jocks; even those who seem like assholes early on prove to be three-dimensional, and just because certain characters do or say hurtful things at one time doesn’t make them inherently mean. Like that one kid who was talking shit about Molly in the bathroom, but then at the party he was leading her and Amy around and telling them he’d miss them.",0
2865,"As another example, I thought the scene between Amy and Hope was really sweet and when it ended really poorly, I was really sad. But then Hope was shown to still be into Amy, and her anger at the time was just an in-the-moment reaction. ""so next year when I'm in New Haven""",0

Olivia Wilde feels like a must-watch director to me; on top of a great cast, Booksmart had great writing and cinematography (hope this becomes a thing with comedies, building off of Game Night). I couldn't see any glaring first-time director issues/growing pains One thing I loved about the movie is how positive it was. There were no villains or the classic “popular kids vs nerds” divide in order to create conflict in the script. Everyone seemed to get along no matter how different.",0
2874,"In the bathroom scene with Molly overhearing her classmates, I was dreading the others start to say that she was fat and ugly... but no, they said “she’s hot but the problem is her personality”. I found that very refreshing. Also, the hot jock hooking up with not the typical beauty. ",0

Booksmart, Ladybird and the Edge of Seventeen are top tier for female coming of age films and are all directed by women The scene where Miss Fine is talking to Molly and Amy in the car about being glad they are finally going out hit really close to home for me. She started talking about how she didn’t go out in high school very much and the pendulum shifted completely when she was in college, where she would do tons of stupid shit because of what she missed out in high school. Being 21 rn, I see this in my own life and a lot of my friend lives too, I feel like this topic hasn’t been explored much in many movies, it was my favorite scene. Yep, I’m calling it now: this one’s a banger Never thought I'd hear fucking Death Grips in a high school comedy the pool sequence and the one take that follows is stunning. olivia wilde is a great director.",0

Can’t wait for more. I’m very tempted to buy tickets for Broadway in 2021 (already on sale starting Sept. 2021) hoping the world is back to normal. David Byrne is just the best kind of weird Missed this thread, but I watched it live. I’m a huge Talking Heads fan who will turn Stop Making Sense on whenever I just need something on, so I’m **incredibly** biased, but I absolutely loved this.

Blind was amazing with the shadows, and I am now obsessed with Jacquelene Acevedo (the female percussionist).",0
2880,"Overall just gives me good feelings. Loved this but also hate how much it makes me wish I was at a concert right now. Absolutely loved this. It felt fresh, lively, upbeat, and delightful to watch. The band was amazing; everyone was in sync, and the renditions of some of the old Talking Heads songs were great. Spike Lee’s direction was fantastic as well. I love how he didn’t just put a camera in front of the stage; the way he shot it really added to the energy of the show. The overhead shots in particular were really well-done. ",0
2881,"Also- This Must Be the Place is the most perfect song ever recorded imo, and their performance here was just euphoric. Worth the watch just for that part alone. No spoilers but should I watch Stop Making Sense before watching this? The pure musicianship on display was just amazing to see, especially since haven’t been able to experience a live concert in 6+ months. This is the exact sort of movie I wanted this year. It's full of hope and good vibes but also doesn't ignore the issues America is facing. David Byrne is such a unique but magnetic front man. It genuinely felt like a sequel to Stop Making Sense. I saw the show live a couple years ago but as a concert, and the added sort of narrative and the way it wrapped and tied things up with how it began really added a lot to what I already thought was a perfect show",0
2882,"losing 'brain connections' as we grow up and the idea of getting them back but on the outside by just relating to each other in a better way, while even having a bit in the middle, which ties to a song, about trying to do so with technology and tv but failing",0
2883,"it's just so well thought-out and constructed, specially considering these songs weren't originally intended to tie this way at all or nothing",0
2884,"not a particularly original or super deep message, but it's just delivered in a beautiful way, and it's the cherry on top of already the best show I've ever seen live and a fucking insane display of musical prowess",0
2885,"beautiful I watched Stop Making Sense over the summer, loved it, thought it was genuinely fantastic and probably the best concert film I had seen. ",0
2886,"That being said, I think I loved this even more. The visuals alone were worth being sold on, with David Byrne & Spike Lee both being visual geniuses, so putting them together was bound to create a cool result. ",0
2887,"Entertaining, great music, and a powerful message, this is easily one of my favorite films of the year. A worthwhile modern successor to Stop Making Sense.  It’s just delightful. It's been months since I last worked at a live concert, let alone went to one for fun. This really made me miss live performances and being at one, and plus I stan David Byrne hard. Amazing show Stop Making Sense is one of my all time favorite films and this felt like such a unique modern way of doing it. I love how spare the staging is so you can see how complex the movements and lighting cues were. The chains were great and there was constant reinvention on how they were used which I loved. ",0
2888,"Also me and my boyfriend have decided that ""our song"" is Road to Nowhere so we were super happy it capped off the show! Byrne was in my city summer of 2018 preforming this show, but I was out of town for a wedding. So extremely bummed I wasn't able to see this live. I wonder why Spike Lee chose this project. I'm not casting aspersions on either Byrne or Lee, they're both great artists, but it's an unexpected collaboration, isn't it? This is a guy who’s singing and dancing on a theater stage ... for those who don’t know what they’re getting into. Reposting what I posted about this fantastic movie last week (tl;dr one of my favourite films of the year and maybe the most joyful film I've seen in a long time):",0
2889,">I just watched it today at the London Film Fest and I don't think there's gonna be another movie this year that'll make me feel the way this movie did. From the infectious music to the surreal choreography to the crowd reactions (sometimes the camera itself take the perspective of an audience member), you can feel so much joy and energy within the movie. I also loved the way it highlights each background performer, making it feel less like they're a bunch of disparate props but an actual community of people who are working together and with Byrne. The movie does have some emotional but necessary moments, specifically a cover of Janelle Manoe's Hell You Talmbout, that adds to Byrne's (and Lee's) plea to create an American utopia, where people are able to truly connect and empathize with each other.",0
2890,">It's my favourite Spike Lee film of the year and amongst his best ever. Just watched it, amazing film. Even though I never saw the live version (I'm in Brazil and I couldn't afford it when the tour came this way in 2018), I'm a huge fan of the original album and of the cast recording, and I plan to catch it at least once in 2021, when the Broadway run restarts. ",0
2891,"Part of the spectacle is how Lee chose to film the show: there are some cool weird angles and unexpected zooms that really complement the whole thing. I didn't love the banter in-between songs (they didn't really make the gig flow, with one or two exceptions) but it's nothing that made it worse. The performance of Janelle Monae's ""Hell You Talmbout"" was powerful, with pictures of the people mentioned in the lyrics being shown on screen.",0
2892,"The only thing that disappointed me was the fact that a few songs were abridged, such as ""Everyday Is A Miracle"" (a whole verse and chorus were cut). I was also expecting ""The Great Curve"" to be part of the encore as it is in the album. where can I watch this? I have loved David Byrne since listening to a cassette of Little Creatures at a friend's house in the mid 80s.",0
2893,I enjoyed the film immensely. I really like the speaking sections which gently guided the narrative.,0
2894,"I was fortunate enough to watch the film as part of the London Film Festival and there was a recorded interview with David before they showed the film. He talked about how he wasn't there to preach, rather show than tell. Seeing a diverse group of people create something wonderful and joyful was the message.",0
2895,"Also, David said you were meant to experience it as though you were in the audience or on the stage, that it was the real thing.",0
2896,"So, I thought the section with big red writing and all the photos was jarring. It went against the subtlety of the rest of performance. The music behind it was beautiful, and I think it would have been just as powerful without. The song's lyrics were ""say his name"", or ""say her name"". We didn't need to show their face. It was incongruous with the lyrics and the rest of the show. They also added George Floyd who had died since the performance, and wasn't named in the song. There's nothing wrong with that per se, but it felt unnecessary. If they were adding to the names to make it more current, or to tap into the present feeling, I don't think that was needed. It's a powerful song as it is, and I wonder whether it diminishes it.",0
2897,"The sound they all make together is really great, the sound crew did an amazing job.",0
2898,"Also, I love it whenever David picks up a guitar.",0
2899,"Overall I really enjoyed the film. I took my son to see it, and I really hoped he would pick up some of the love of weirdness, great musicianship, freedom, joy, ambiguity, beautiful presentation and performance. We'll see. Just wonderful. I've a feeling Jonathan Demme would've really loved this. Would be interesting if this won Best Documentary thus giving Spike Lee his 1st win for a film.",0
2900,Does anyone else think the movie was implying that the dad/Ted was the one who got Autumn pregnant? I felt like they were setting that up but then it didn't go anywhere. Very powerful and haunting at points.,0
2901,"The scene from where the title came from just fucking floored me. Liked the movie a lot, but my biggest (stupid) question was why they brought that big ass suitcase if they didn’t expect to stay more than the day? Everyone is rightfully talking about the scene that gave the film its title, but another scene that really stuck out to me was >!when Autumn tried to induce a miscarriage. God, it was so brutal to watch her choke down those vitamins and punch herself in the stomach over and over!<. Sidney Flanigan was an incredible find here, and I really enjoyed Talia Ryder's performance, too. She has *very* expressive eyes. The title scene is one of the most harrowing performances I’ve seen in a while. Can’t believe Sidney Flanigan’s never acted before.",0
2902,"This entire film is a great example of “show, don’t tell”. Talia Ryder has star potential. Those eyes will make a ton of money. An example of how one great scene can make a movie. As people are saying the title moment was just...incredible. Just watched this. I thought the questionnaire scene was absolutely incredible. Besides that, I thought it was a solid little film. Direction was a little boring.",0
2903,"Also -- maybe I'm way off, but...she was raped by her stepdad, right? In the beginning he couldn't even look at her to tell her she did a good job. And once he does, Autumn storms out. Then the scene later where he's with the dog being creepy and saying ""she likes it, shes a little slut, etc"" and it being a major trigger for Autumn. [deleted] Really strong debut performances from Sidney Flanigan and Talia Ryder. I honestly think these two girls are going to be movie stars. Talia Ryder is in Spielberg's West Side Story at the end of the year too and I really think she's going to take off. Flanigan gives a really natural performance that doesn't even feel like its acting. She gives the movie this fly on the wall documentary feel that's also aided by the gorilla filmmaking in this that you know they didn't have permits for, especially all those subway scenes.",0
2904,"I think the movie tells an important story, but it all felt very procedural for me a times. Like they take you through the entire abortion process from how I would imagine it exactly goes down. It's emotional, and impactful, but there's an obvious message behind it. The movie is looking to ignite change. A change I believe in, because America, your abortion laws are fucked up, but it also makes the film feel like a Planned Parenthood commercial with high production values. Just saying.",0
2905,"It's a simple story led by some really strong performances tied together with an important message. Great chemistry between the two leads. I just think the plot meanders a little bit and I was taken out of the film by how overtly political it's trying to be, even if I agree with its saying.",0
2906,"Made me feel bad for being a dude. Which is fair, we are shitty. Amazing and impactful film with beautiful lead performances. One question I had: why did the crisis pregnancy centre lie about how far along Autumn was? And also what was the dad saying to the dog? I'm sorry. The movie is good, but it is also really misandrist. All the men are predators and all the women except one are kind characters. And even that one (you know which) thinks that she's acting in a good way.",0
2907,"Reality is not like this. Imagine if the men in the movie were characterised as ""Jews"". We would be talking about a sub-Riefensthal piece.",0
2908,"And it is sad, because the movie is actually good. Sharon Van Etten is in this? Gonna try and queue it up later. Beneath the abortion story, there's a harrowing depiction of how young women are experiencing sex.  Every male character in this movie is kind of a zombified pervert.  Jasper is the only one who shows any brain activity, but even he is just going to great lengths to try to hook up with this girl who will barely talk to him.",0
2909,"It certainly can be true to life, but it's also like an impressionistic depiction of men from the perspective of someone with the history that Autumn describes to her counselor.  Eventually, you think that every man she meets is going to harass her or harm her in someway.  And then you realize you're feeling what she's feeling, and that makes you appreciate even more what she's been through. I really liked this movie. It was sadly relatable at times and it’s a good story. Great acting from everyone involved. That clinic scene was very hard to watch but eye opening. This was a 7/10 for me until the questionnaire scene and from then on it was a really great, engaging film. Every minute was exhilarating and Autumn cousin was an angel I don’t know how to put into terms what this movie made me feel. It was unsettling, but not in any negative way. That’s the best way I can explain it. The way that music & dialogue is used is amazing. I wanted to like this movie, but I was seriously put off by the fact they made every male character with more 1 line a serious creep/pervert/asshole.  I counted 7 -- only 2-3 were necessary to the story.  The acting and story besides the overbearing message ""all men are pigs"" were good.",0
2910,"**Four Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days** (2007) is extremely similar to this movie and far superior. Just finished it and I really loved it. I can't believe that was Sidney Flanigan's first movie ever. Damn. She was absolutely perfect.",0
2911,I don't understand the low scores on Metacritic though. This movie fucked my shit up. I can't remember the last time a movie left me wanting more like this one did.,0
2912," Definitely worth the 20 dollars I spent on the rental. Honestly, I don't think I would have heard of this movie if it didn't go up for rental early on Amazon, and that's a shame. Calling it now, Talia Ryder & Sidney Flanagan are going to be mega stars. I was hoping it would have been better than it was. Outside of one or two scenes, the film is content with just putting a camera on someone and following them with almost no soundtrack, letting the camera speak for the characters. https://youtu.be/Uu3pKy7xebk",0
2913,I made a video on this movie if you guys want to check it out!! I’m a rising youtube film critic so it’d be appreciated:) but only if you want to!! I thought it was pretty impacting. Especially the title scene. All with a first time actor in Sidney. Here her talk about her experience and being cast in the movie here  [https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rec/id1455939192?i=1000471562732](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rec/id1455939192?i=1000471562732),0
2914,"I just want to know more about Cthulhu and the drill. Like what the fuck were they trying to drill to and find. Props to Kristen Stewart for going full Ellen Ripley and killing Cthulhu! Overall, I thought it was good for what it was. Always love a good Creature Feature. Definitely can compare to Alien, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Loved the creatures. Wish they were shown a little less in the movie to keep with the mystery of their appearance. But, when they were hidden and snuck around with very little to be seen, it was admittedly tense. The deaths were surprisingly brutal. Reminded me of Life in that regard. Was really into that. Slow motion shots were done very well and the cinematography was definitely there. Also, a very surprising ending with revealing >!the giant Cthulhu type monster. That honestly shocked me. And to see Kristen Stewart sacrifice herself to destroy the base and the monsters.!< It did have it's problems. Sometimes it was hard to understand some of the dialogue. Some of the jokes didn't land, but most did. I'm a TJ Miller fan, so it was very reminiscent to his role in Cloverfield. Solid enough for me to stay entertained through it's hour and a half runtime. Would watch it again. 6.5/10 for me. Great creature design and effects. Cool shots.  Pretty nice cast. Paper thin story and characters. Kristen Stewart is the sexiest woman on Earth and TJ Miller has been playing the same character for a decade. ",0
2915,This all adds up to a mild thumbs up especially in the depressing slog of life that is January. Interesting observation:,0
2916,">!When they first meet the captain (Lucien), he says that he got 20+ people out using the escape pods.  But at the end of the movie, news reports say that only 2 survivors were found (Smith and Emily).  This implies that the creatures snatched all of the people Captain Lucien thought he saved, and would have gotten Smith and Emily's pods as well, making Norah's sacrifice all the more necessary.!<",0
2917,">!Only thought about this when one my friends said ""Those pods were going pretty fast, I don't think the monsters could have caught them so why did Norah have to blow herself up?""!<",0
2918,I did have a few questions of my own though:,0
2919,">!Captain Lucien stated ""There's nothing there"" when asked about an old mining station; however that's exactly where Norah ends up after she blacks out.  There, she finds Lucien's old nametag and uniform, meaning he worked there.  Was he hiding this information on purpose?  Why was that station abandoned?  Why did it appear so isolated on the map and away from all other points of interest?  What was he working on?  He also seemed particularly un-phased by the discovery of the creatures, almost as if he already knew about their existence.  !<",0
2920,">!I'm particularly intrigued by the creatures, especially the Queen/Alpha.  Most deep-sea creatures are scavengers, feeding on dead or decaying material that sinks from above, but these things were obviously predatory in nature, which makes me wonder what they would be hunting down there.  Were they drawn to that location due to the drilling or were they in long-term hibernation and disturbed when the mining began?!< Correct me if I'm wrong, but when Nora pulled Paul out of the rubble, did he call her a ""sweet, flat-chested elven creature""? Because that's what it sounded like and it was incredible Those suits were some of the nicest, aesthetically pleasing “exo suit” type suits I’ve seen in a very long time.",0
2921,"Sorry for saying “suit” so much, but jeeze they were neat to look at. Something about humanoid monsters creep me out.",0
2922,"The reveal of the big one scared me because at one point it looked like a huge humanoid thing just walking towards them. Really liked this movie. One of my favorite little untold details was how the station reactors had a UI to turn it into a bomb, including blast radius, simple initiation, count down, and sensors on the pods to detect ""approaching entities"".  There were obviously hints before the end that the captain/company knew about the creatures and likely were ""drilling"" as a coverup for studying them, but I thought the bomb details were a nice touch. I found this to be quite solid and I really appreciated that it was short and tight and fast paced. Ad astra just dragged in my opinion and this was the complete opposite. My main plot hole was why she couldn’t just sit on her friends lap at the end. Surely they design those pods to support a 250lb male so why can’t two 110 lbs women squeeze in? exactly as advertised, 10/10 wetness The scene where Kristen Stewart almost gets eaten alive by one of the creatures was pretty terrifying I'm still pissed at how similar this is to the origin of the Cloverfield movie without being a prequel to Cloverfield. Decent movie over all though Regarding TJ Miller:",0
2923,Hi. Im a former US army infantryman. I deployed overseas.,0
2924,There are ALWAYS people cracking jokes in terrible times. Always. Those people tend to handle stress a lot better. Even his matter-of-fact delivery style felt right. Just my 2 cents.,0
2925,Now lets discuss how we all just clearly saw fucking Dagon. ,0
2926,"(and how we all lowkey wanted Dagon to live. ) Was not expecting the giant cthulhu like creature at the end. Were the smaller ones swimming in and out of the big one? Some parts looked like it would trigger people with trypophobia So, did everyone miss how >!T.J. Miller's chest tattoo was literally Cthulhu, or are we all too hung up on the Cthulhu sketch in the locker?!< what kind of psychopath doesn’t spit out their toothpaste I honestly loved this movie and its my favorite original monster movie since Cloverfield.  Love the setting, it is terrifying place to be in a situation like this and does a great job making the outcome look bleak.  Characters are all likeable.  Acting is done well.  ",0
2927,Jump scares got me a bunch of times.  Including a scene they are all walking underwater and one of the creatures appears like 3 times within 2 minutes.  ,0
2928,Fast paced movie that never lets up.  Very quick movie that is action packed and has you on the edge of your seat.  ,0
2929,"Go see and support this movie This was an interpretation of Call of Cthulu and I was pretty into it The chaotic ""shit hits the fan"" sequence in the beginning of the film where we saw Kristen slippin', slidin', and yelling throughout the halls was my favorite part of the movie. I really felt the urgency of the entire scene. ",0
2930,"While I do enjoy the music they used throughout the film, I think I would've enjoyed the scenes where they walk on the pitch black ocean floor without any music to increase tension, but with what we got, it was okay since I believed they were really walking on the ocean floor. I was fully sold when kristen stewart punched the other girl to get her into the pod SPOILER REVIEW AHEAD!!!!!",0
2931,"tl:Dr The set pieces and underwater scenes look fantastic, Everyone but TJ Miller does a fairly good job, the plot is simple but effective keeping up the pace with only a small amount of clunky dialogue, it doesn't bog you down with exposition or extended backstoriea, the monsters are a little simple >!but the big one makes up for it.!< If you are fan of Alien and other Sci Fi monster movies, this one is worth watching.",0
2932,"I really enjoyed this movie. Now I can admit I am quite biased as I love deep sea horror such as Deep Star Six and Leviathan. Plus I got stuck watching The Grudge remake last week and this is Video Gold in comparison. That said this is very good movie for fans of Alien style movie. The sets are absolutely gorgeous; you can really believe these characters are underwater. The underwater scenes are pitch black where there is no light so the audience is just as blind as the characters. But, besides the fact that it's what it would be like down there, it doesn't do it to hide bad effects from the audience or anything. ",0
2933,"The characters are pretty good throughout. Nora (Kristen Stewart) tries to do her best to stay calm >!but at once she reaches the old drill site she essentially breaks down, before bucking up, determined to stay alive.!< Jessica Henwick's character Emily does a good job of someone fraying at the seams, managing to just hold herself together >!and survives despite the movie making me think she wouldn't. Vincent Cassell's captain Sam is a little bland at times >!and makes what is easily the dumbest decision is the movie, going back for a bolt gun after rescuing someone a creature pulled away.!< But he manages to portray a fairly good Rock for the others to rely on. John Gallagher Jr plays Smith, who is in love with Emily and their relationship is quite believable, and a good friend of Nora's. He plays a guy way out of his wheelhouse but does the best he can to hold it together and helps other do the same. >!Unfortunately, hespends the latter half of the movie mostly unconscious due to oxygen deprivation.!<",0
2934,">!Mamoudou Athie's character is dead in the first fifteen minutes so barely remember his name.!< And TJ Miller is not a great addition to this movie. His sole role is comic relief and while he has some actually good lines, many fall flat >!and I was glad to seem him go around the hallway point.!< ",0
2935,"Plot wise they don't waste any time. The movies starts, Kristen Stewart monologues for a minute or two, and then the whole place falls apart. From their is almost non stop, with the exception of a few slower moments so the audience isn't overwhelmed, >!as they try to escape the main building an reach one over a mile away that is still intact.!< They don't waste time trying to figure and explain what happened, instead focusing on their survival. A few pieces of dialogue are bit clunky such as TJ Miller, and some story from Nora about her dead finance, but they are few enough that they don't drag it down too much.",0
2936,"As for the creatures, I both like and dislike them. They have a basic design of a humanoid upper body and some kind of jellyfish like lower body, although it's hard to tell as we only ever get a good solid look at their upper bodies. However their appearance is kinda bland to me. They are too similar to humans in my opinion, I would have preferred if they were more like deep sea creatures in design. And there are a couple of times were the CGI falls thru, although there is a decent amount of practical effect in this as well >!The Big One is seriously cool though. Again I'm biased since I love giant monsters, but even so the design is much better. While we don't see it's lower body almost at all, what see off its upper body is distinctly alien in design. Large tentacles on its back, multiple eyes, huge three part mouth covered in teeth, tentacle beard, and strange looking hands. The movie does a good job at hinting about it as they mention how the station is 70% compromised in minutes, or that a 6000 ton drill was uprooted with extreme force.!< ",0
2937,"Overall, while it is not redefining the genre or doing anything revolutionary, this is a very enjoyable movie. If you are a fan of Sci Fi monster movies like Alien, I would seriously recommend you give this movie a look. I went in with absolutely bottomed out expectations. I Expected a complete January dud. Instead I got the best sci-fi thriller I've seen in years. I've been out of the theatre for 12 hours now and the little details keep resurfacing and putting a smile on my face.",0
2938, I expect it to be a cult classic in the same vein of Sunshine or Donnie Darko. ,0
2939,"The production design was fantastic (I eat up psudo-realistic sci-fi). The creatures, the suits, the station, everything was brimming with robust industrial style. The cinematography was fantastic. Each claustrophobic tunnel and wide open ocean scene added weight and tension to every scene.",0
2940,"The characters are pretty stereotypical tropes (the mechanic, the joker, the captain) But most of the cast have moment that allow them to escape their preconceived tropes to make them memorable. ",0
2941,The audio design enhanced the cinematography to create real tension. The score! The aquatic ambience suited the film and really enhanced the experience for me.  ,0
2942,This is really a case of critics not understanding sci-fi. It's not a character drama. There are quite a few small moments where you can see these characters are family. Shown through action and not bogged down with blocks of dialog.,0
2943,"The last time I saw a movie more than once in a theatre was Dunkirk (That was only because of Regal's Oscar reruns). I can't wait to get lost in this movie again. Good thing they had a convenient 'melt down the core button'... that seems too easy. Also the read out to show the monsters chasing the pods and the blast radius, good thing they programmed that! Stewart's character was shown to be smart, able to hot wire stuff and rig up the other suit etc. then to just not use that at the end really seemed like a weird miss. Also black guy dies first? Come on! Edit: also was anyone else hoping the bunny paid off? Like they had to stuff in something to stop a fuel or air leak or something... If this movie just went a bit further and made Titan a front for a cult, and the captain a conflicted member. This thing would have come right together. Still a fun ride.",0
2944,One of the aspect of this movie that I loved the most was how K went from normal to special and back again. ,0
2945,"The scene where the child is revealed to be a girl and K is absolutely crestfallen followed by K realizing that Joi was just a run of the mill AI programmed to say what you want to hear and the ad version of her even called him “Joe” also, which I believe shows that even that was just a part of her programming, really brought home the feeling that K was just a normal replicant with nothing special other than a shared memory or two instead of being born special or “the chosen one”. ",0
2946,"And only after that did he choose to save Deckard himself, revealing that he was special after all, but not because he was born that way, because he became special on his own. Harrison Ford is 2 for 2 with playing regretful dads in sci-fi reboots. That last shot ripped my heart out. You already know that the ""baseline"" lines are from Nabokov's Pale Fire:",0
2947,>Cells interlinked within cells interlinked,0
2948,>Within one stem. And dreadfully distinct,0
2949,">Against the dark, a tall white fountain played.",0
2950,Here's what's interesting: ,0
2951,"Pale Fire is hard to describe if you haven't read it, but it consists of a long poem, ostensibly written by (fictitious) famous poet John Shade, followed by ""notes"" by an editor who proves to be more and more of an unreliable narrator. ",0
2952,"The baseline lines are part of Shade's description of what he saw when he had a near-death experience. Some time later, he reads in a newspaper an account from a woman who also had a near-death experience, and, in the poem, the paper quotes her as saying ""Beyond that orchard through a kind of smoke / I glimpsed **a tall white fountain**--and awoke.""",0
2953,"Shade sees this as too coincidental -- maybe this is some ur-memory, or proof of an afterlife! So he contacts the newspaper and gets in touch with the woman... who seems to have no memory of this. He checks back with the newspaper, and is told ",0
2954,">""It's accurate. I have not changed her style.",0
2955,>There's one misprint--not that it matters much:,0
2956,">Mountain, not fountain. The majestic touch.""",0
2957,"So the ""tall white fountain"" was an identity-shaking, shared connection between two people... except it turned out not to be true after all.  **Kinda like K's memory about the horse and the furnace.**",0
2958,edit: [The poem part of Pale Fire](http://www.shannonrchamberlain.com/palefirepoem.html). The baseline part is 705-707; the woman's quote is 757-758; the misprint quote is 800-802.,0
2959,Go pick up a copy of Pale Fire! It's the best.,0
2960,"edit edit: To make it even more postmodern-delicious, note lines 781-783. The woman is eager to meet Shade because of her affinity for his poem about Mont Blanc (a tall white *mountain*). So who influenced whom? So many feels when ""Tears in Rain"" played as K was lying in the snow.  Prepare for the biggest piece of movie magic you'll see all year: Old Harrison Ford actually *trying*.  [One nice touch I noticed: all the boys in the orphanage have shaved heads, but all the girls have hair. When we see the flashback to the toy horse scene - the memory K thinks is his - the child is the only one with hair. We don't know it at the time, but that's because she's a girl.](#spoiler) Who else wants K’s jacket? The scene of K watching snowflakes hit his hand and kind of realizing what it’s like to be human and then cut to the daughter with fake snow at the end, who as a real being can’t feel those same things.",0
2961,"Tripping me out on what it means to be alive. One smaller thing I appreciated was when Gosling just ran through a bloody wall and the film treated it casually. It was just an intense thing happening in an intense scene, and I loved it.  The kite trap to Ben Franklin his ass out of the sky was my favorite part of the movie. I think the moment when Joi was killed was a wonderful test for the audience. That scream of ""I love you"" as she was stamped out was a great test for the viewer on whether or not they see the AI as human, or as a creation distinct from even the androids. I was actually a little taken aback that I didn't react to it they way I would have expected to, I barely reacted at all. I was a little ashamed that I didn't see her as a living being because why shouldn't I? I found it fascinating after watching that that moment could be either a failure on the movie's part to humanize her, or a failure on my own for being incapable of empathizing with an AI, even one programmed to appease it's 'owner'. And that's an amazing thing for a film to do. That transition from the embers in the fire to the city lights was fantastic.  [deleted] The scene where K was checking the furnace was nerve-wrecking. Amazing direction throughout the film. Dune fans everywhere are like *fucking do it m8* ""You're nowhere near baseline!""",0
2962,"That line was heavy for me.  A bit depressed after this, I don't want to go back to my regular life. Throughout most of the movie, I was hoping they wouldn’t make K the child, but near the end, especially when that lady was like ‘Oh you thought you were the child?’ and he looked so crestfallen, I felt so sorry for him.",0
2963,"I thought Ryan Gosling did a fantastic job, great acting. Tears in rain. Joy in snow. I'm glad Jared Leto finally let us a glimpse into his personal life. I absolutely loved this movie. It might be one of my favorite sequels ever. ",0
2964,"Joi is an incredible character. I loved how they avoided going the easy route with her, and instead respected her for what she represented for K, as a companion and someone to give his life validation. The twist with her being simply a mirror for him to project his own delusions of grandeur into himself was masterful and heartbreaking. She quite literally just ""Said what he wanted to hear"". ",0
2965,"I also loved how the name ""Joe"" can imply many things. There's the Kafka connections, but with the main twist of him not being special, there's also the fact that he's quite literally an ""Average Joe"". All in all, this movie adapted the original novel better than the first movie. K's life being parallel to Roy's, right down to a ""tears in the rain"" ending was great. This might be Villaneuve's magnum opus. If Ryan Gosling can't find a real girlfriend in the future than everyone else is certainly doomed. 2 quick thoughts: This is one of the best shot movies I've ever seen. The cinematography is mind blowing. ",0
2966,"And this is Harrison Ford's finest performance since Air Force One. Maybe even the Fugitive. I really liked that Wallace was unable to duplicate Tyrell's work because he lacks vision. How bout that wacky ""Baseline"" test!??  ",0
