82," The foster parents are pure wholesome and joy.

Was absolutely surprised by the appearance of the shazam family.

John glover still playing a dick father from his smallville days. That bullet immunity scene had me fucking rolling That cold shoulder from his mother was ICYYYY Something I really liked about the movie was the fact that they never explicitly said whether Billy was truly pure of heart. Having the 7 sins be freed before Billy meets Shazam was a good way to explain how a little shit like him could earn the power. 

And when he held the power of the 7 sins at the end and seemed unphased, you can take it as him finally becoming pure of heart or maybe the 7 sins having no effect on Shazam. It's a nice message that you don't have to be perfect to be a good person. When Freddy’s superhero self immediately started flying after his first transformation, I couldn’t help but think that the disabled version of himself always “believed” he could fly and that’s why he was able to fly so much faster than Billy could T_T  Do you guys think the two jock bullies said ""no homo"" before getting on a ferris wheel ride together Everybody is talking about how great Zachary Levi is in this (and he is) but Mark Strong is fantastic as well. He plays cartoonishly menacing so well without falling into ""too ridiculous"" or ""too serious""  It’s insane to me that we’ve gotten to a point in comic book movies where they’ll put in someone as comic booky and goofy as Mister fucking Mind and play him for 100% seriousness.  I loved that they were playing Mortal Kombat X, I can only assume Billy chose Raiden. 

It’s kinda funny cause if MKX exists, then does Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe exist? cause Shazam was in that game lmao. Zachary Levi did an absolutely phenomenal job holy crap. I fully bought that he was a fourteen year old boy in a man's body.  Billy Batson’s Mom is a better super villain than Thanos change my mind Best part (and realistic) part of the movie was that Billy and Freddy initially use Shazam to make some quick money to do stuff like buy beer and go to strip clubs. Absolutely hilarious and probably accurate for a 15 year old kid in a mans body “Yes! You guys finally figured it out!” 

Easily my favorite line in the movie.  As brutal as the deaths in the boardroom were, to me the most shocking one was the poor scientist who turned to dust when she touched the door in Sivana’s office. Damn. Say my name scene with the family was amazingly funny at my theater.  That bus had some strong windshields.

The Shazam family coming together was one of the best superhero scenes I’ve seen in a long time. The dad didn't age... “This must be the cool security guard that all of the kids talk about” 

“No that’s another one, this one sucks” 

Best laugh I got out of the whole movie. Man I loved it. DC really are starting to get back on track. For a movie seemingly more kid-centric than most modern superhero movies, the 7 sin monsters were legitimately horrifying.  ♪ **Hands!** ♩

♩ Lightning from my **hands!** ♪

♪  Lightning from my *haaaaannds*. ♩ I really like that the movie gave us some insights as to how Shazam's transformation works:  

\- if he can't say the name clearly it won't work (like if he's underwater)  

\- the lighting is usually piercing enough to pass thru a roof, but in case it gets blocked, another lighting will come down (like when he was in the mall and the first lighting got blocked by the plastic roof and the second one broke it)  

\- I liked how he used the lighting offensively too by putting his enemy in between, reminds me of that cartoon where he grabs I think it's Superman? and just Shazams the shit outta him  

Now I'm just wondering what his limits are and what his power looks like at its max, we didn't get that in this movie since the final fight was more of a mind game but hopefully they're leaving that for his fight vs black adam Fun fact: Adam Brody and DJ Cotrona (the adult versions of Freddy and Pedro) were cast as the Flash and Superman in George Miller's *Justice League: Mortal* before it got cancelled.

It took awhile, but they finally got to be in a DC movie after all! Haven't seen anyone mention this, but the mom at the carnival scene really struck a cord with me, when he remembers it it's all colorful and happy and his mom is smiling but then when his mom remembers it (and since she's grown I would think her version is more accurate) it's actually kinda gloomy and she's stressed out which goes to show how we tend to look at the past through rose tinted glasses, then it got darker as not only did his mom left him as a kid but also she doesn't really want him back now either she didn't even hug him, seems to be working a dead end job (based on her waitress-like work uniform) and seems to be in a toxic relationship, hopefully she does better in future movies I honestly think one of my favorite details are the differences between the Flashback of his mother losing him at the carnival. In the first one the mother is incredibly pretty with perfect make up and is just glowing. 

But in the ""real"" flashback from his mother's point of view. She has no makeup, looks dead tired and snaps at him when he asks about the tiger.

It's such a small detail but it's so very accurate to how a kid would remember that moment. ""Lay your hands on my staff.""

""Gross""

This movie is amazing. ",0
40," Michael Keaton has probably less than 5 minutes of screentime and he still registered his presence almost as much as the rest of the cast. What a charismatic actor!

Sacha Baron delivered the best scene though. ""It's the academy awards of protesters and it's an honor just to be nominated"" was hands-down the most Sorkin line in this piece. 

Also, that opening was brilliant and riveting. I knew before the title card hit that I was in for a great film. Best film I've seen in a long time. Mark Rylance was absolutely phenomenal in this film.

After so many of his recent roles being quiet and reserved men, the moment he yells “NO HE DOESN’T” was a legitimately powerful and thundering moment. Good lord. The judge is fucking infuriating.

I’m still processing this movie. It’s... maddening. That was the most ""and that student's name? Albert Einstein""-ass ending I've ever seen. Can we give Frank Langella some props for being probably the best on screen villain since whoever the guy that played Skeletor in Masters Of The Universe is. The opening was fantastic. Sorkin does such a good job settling you in to a time and place. I immediately knew who everyone was and why they were important. The made-up ending felt very cheesy, especially when you have it coming right after Sacha Baron-Cohen delivered one the best scene in the film. That aside the film was fantastic. Judge was an asshole as he supposed to be so props to Langella. Refreshing to see Gordon-Levitt again, even though he has little room to wiggle through. 

That aside, delving down the wiki-hole after watching it was one hell of a ride. The Fred Hampton assassination was fucking disgusting, although it looked tame compared to the COINTELPRO shit the FBI did. [deleted] I suppose the ""one egg is an oeuf"" joke needs to be added to the grand list of Sorkinisms Abbie Hoffman was also portrayed in Forrest Gump.  The hippie at the Vietnam protest who gives him the microphone and says ""Viet Fucking Nam!"" Really enjoyed the movie. Did a great job of showing, as Hoffman said, the contempt the government had (and still has) for certain groups of people. Mayor’s office denying permits to the park, police armed to the teeth at a peaceful protest because of the lack of permits, the police hounding, cornering, and then starting the violence. Nixon’s White House and the DOJ making an example out of a group of people that the prior DOJ found to be innocent. A racist bigot senile judge who has already determined guilt before the trial began. It’s all so infuriating. Mark Rylance was amazing in this. Should be nominated for Supporting Actor. Sacha Baron Cohen, Jeremy Strong, Eddie Redmayne and Yahya Abdul-Mateen were also great. I know some people aren't happy with the name reading at the end, but I honestly found it touching and teared up some. The protest where about stopping more deaths in a unwinnable war.  I like to think it was also done to really echo whats going on today: too many innocent lives were lost that didn't need to be lost- from covid, to police brutality, and protest. It's too easy to just recognize the amount of deaths and not see them as individuals wiith families.

The acting was honestly amazing. I honestly forgot this was a Sorkin feature. The court transcript is available online and this trial really was a travesty of justice. 

I think this movie did a serviceable job in toe-ing the line to portray an infuriating situation without coming off as ham-fisted (i.e. making the prosecution cartoonish-ly evil and the defence cartoonishly good). In my opinion, the events speak for themselves without needing to take artistic license with the characters of anyone involved. 

However, these moments in particular felt contrived.

1) The final scene of Hayden reading the list of dead Vietnam soldiers did not happen as far as I'm aware, and the change from what really happened seemed unnecessary. The actual closing statement made by Kunstler is really powerful, and I'll quote it at the end. 

2) The moment where Hoffman talks about pronouns and how he has actually read all of Hayden's publications was sort of a ""wink at the camera"" moment. 

3) Ramsey Clark's portrayal was a caricature. Making him a casual give-no-fucks badass was satisfying to watch as a viewer, but definitely was playing to the audience's sympathies. 

4) One of the most confusing additions is David Dellinger punching the deputy, which did not happen in real life. Dellinger was a radical pacifist and this addition is offensive. 

5) Showing Fred Hampton being murdered during the time of the trial - when he was murdered over a month later. 


-----------------------------------------


General thoughts:

I enjoyed the decision to humanize JGL by showing his internal struggle between his ethics and duty to the law- though I'm not sure as to the veracity of this.

Incredible performances by Judge Hoffman, Seale, Kunstler, Dellinger, Hayden, and Strong in particular. Eddie Redmayne pulled off a great accent, while surprisingly I felt that Sacha Baron Cohen's accent was a little sloppy at times. 

Sorkin is a master of dialogue, and could have done without some of the snarky whispers that are really directed at the audience. 	Most of Lee Weiner's dialogue consisted of these quips.

-----------------------------

All-in-all, the events that happened are really so absurd that it must have been hard to convey their realism. Things like Hoffman/Rubin wearing the robes, the treatment of Seale, gross bias from the judge, etc. 

The verdict of the trial in reality was not a feel-good moment, and I'm still confused as to why it was portrayed as such. Along with the sentences, the judge ordered the long hair of the defendants AND defense attorneys to be forcibly cut due to being deemed offensive. The real life events left many people angry, and I believe this movie should have left the viewer feeling angry as well - if true to history. 

-----------------------------

Parts of the closing statement from the (real life) trial:

>  ""When a new truth comes upon the earth, or a great idea necessary for mankind is born, where does it come from?  Not from the police force, or the prosecuting attorneys, or the judges, or the lawyers, or the doctors.  Not there.  It comes from the despised and the outcasts, and it comes perhaps from jails and prisons.  It comes from men who have dared to be rebels and think their thoughts, and their faith has been the faith of rebels.
    ""What do you suppose would have happened to the working men except for these rebels all the way down through history?  Think of the complacent cowardly people who never raise their voices against the powers that be.  If there had been only these, you gentlemen of the jury would be hewers of wood and drawers of water.  You gentlemen would have been slaves.  You gentlemen owe whatever you have and whatever you hope to these brave rebels who dared to think, and dared to speak, and dared to act.""


> An intolerable war abroad has divided and dismayed us all.  Racism at home and poverty at home are both causes of despair and discouragement.  In a so-called affluent society, we have people starving, and people who can't even begin to approximate the decent life.
    These are rough problems, terrible problems, and as has been said bv everybody in this country, they are so enormous that they stagger the imagination.  But they don't go away by destroying their critics.  They don't vanish by sending men to jail.  They never did and they never will.
    To use these problems by attempting to destroy those who protest against them is probably the most indecent thing that we can do.  You can crucify a Jesus, you can poison a Socrates, you can hand John Brown or Nathan Hale, you can kill a Che Guevara, you can jail a Eugene Debs or a Bobby Seale.  You can assassinate John Kennedy or a Martin Luther King, but the problems remain.  The solutions are essentially made by continuing and perpetuating with every breath you have the right of men to think, the right of men to speak boldly and unafraid, the right to be masters of their souls, the right to live free and to die free.  The hangman's rope never solved a single problem except that of one man. I've never had the beginning of a movie hype me up more than this one. The introduction of Abbie Hoffman, Bobby Seale, Tom Hayden, David Dellinger, and Jerry Rubin finishing each other's sentences, mixed with the archival footage of the mounting tensions over Vietnam and the draft was spectacular. Like we were immediately rolling into the sixties. Honestly, I feel like this movie is perfect in its timing. The widespread protests, police violence, judicial appointments, political trials, the chaos behind the concept of “law and order”, etc. 

Being someone who lives in Portland and has attended numerous protests here (only to have the narrative be reconstructed in a misleading way 99% of the time) it felt somewhat justified to have a similar story told on screen.

I also loved the way they portrayed the differences between Bobby Seale and the rest of the group: Bobby was **not** treated like a human being with equal protections under the law during this trial. The scene where they gagged him actually made me feel sick. Obviously he’s not a huge part of the conclusion of the story, but I’m very happy that they gave us plenty of time to absorb what he went through and how he was treated in the initial phases rather than having them treat him like some sort of tangent. 

Then the differences between Hayden and Hoffman was great. I loved their dialogue and I feel like it tells a story about what’s currently happening with the left side of the US political spectrum. I’m someone who relates to Hayden a bit more than I relate to Hoffman, but when Hayden stands for the judge, I actually wanted to scream at him. I also loved when Hoffman gave his testimony and blew everyone out of the water. 

And that judge....I think the last “character” I hated more was Joffrey Baratheon (and Joff was fictional!). 

Overall, I can see why this movie might not be super satisfying for normal people who aren’t revolving their entire lives around the current political situation were in, but for myself, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Clap at the end felt like such a 90s scene. 

Still enjoyed the movie although I didn't know that much about that story. Best line: 

""Alright, raise your hands if any of you have ever shown up for jury duty. No? Then shut the fuck up."" Such a good film.

Frank Langella, SBC, Mark Rylance and Eddie Redmayne deserve to be up for awards consideration.

Really liked how Sorkin spliced real riot footage in between filmed riot footage. Made you fee like you were actually there.

The shots at Trump were kinda noticeable as well ""The President is not the client of the Attorney General.""

Definitely something to watch in history class to educate our kids. I loved the 'do you think there were only 7 people protesting and the rest were all FBI informants?' line. I've often wondered that myself pertaining to certain groups. Incredible, IMO. 

The acting ranged from passable to great. No bad performances. Frank langella was excellently frustrating as the judge. Cohen and Redmayne were really evocative of their respective counterparts, even if they weren't spot on impressions.

The writing was excellent, Sorkin-y but not outlandish. Witty but not to the point of not being believable. Often Sorkin's characters dont seem real becuase of how quick witted they all are. I felt he pulled back enough here though.
I believe I remember that egg joke from an episode of the westwing from Margaret to Leo, too.

Directing was pretty good too. The story moved along well. And the framing of the story around the trial was very well done.

For cons.. I do find it dipped in intensity a little bit once Bobby Seales mistrial was called, that really felt like a bigger ""win"" than the ending. And the ending wasnt great, but to be fair the ending in real life wasnt great either. I honestly cant think of a way for the real life ending to be portrayed optimistically, maybe it shouldnt have been. But I respect Sorkin for trying, there are enough pessimists.

Solid 9 / 10 I never wanted to beat a judge with a bat more in my life. Holy fuck if that person was real I would pay good money to see him get hit by a car. I was impressed by the performances (Jeremy Strong was particularly entertaining) and liked the ultimately anti-war messages even if the final scene was a little outlandish. Anyone else notice a few weird cuts, particularly towards the beginning of the trial when the judge shuts down Abbie? Loved this. Gripping story, legitimately funny, and genuinely moving. This movie felt like Sorkin really finding a way to blend so much of what makes his work so special-- snappy dialogue, quippy humor, courtroom drama, and serious, heavy-handed political themes. 

I went in with high expectations and Sorkin really exceeded them. As an aside-- at the end of the movie, when they gave us the coda about how the defendants lives progressed, I realized just how old-fashioned  this type of movie has become. Shout out to Netflix and Paramount for having the hudspa to put out a movie like this. ",1
2," I just feel so mad that this amazing festival was left to languish in relative obscurity until now, despite the massive talent surrounding it.  How?  Why? That moon landing & Staple Singers performance segment is a masterclass of editing. 
This whole film was terrific. The gobsmacking solo rendition of “My Girl” by Temptations singer David Ruffin is alone worth the watch. Wow. But there are so many absolutely incredible performances captured beautifully on film. The documentary context of the event is also well done, but there were several times when I was watching some mind-blowing performance and then they cut to an interview and I was like noooooooo!! So hopefully someday they release “Summer of Soul: The Full Performances,” which I would buy in a heartbeat. So damn good. I knew all these artists going in but I’d never heard these versions. Gladys Knight & The Pips, Sly & The Family Stone, and Nina Simone at the end were all flat out spectacular. Fantastic doc. I really loved Quest’s exchange with Darryl (I believe that’s who it was) at the end. I can only imagine how it must have felt knowing that this really did happen, and it wasn’t just a moment stored in someone’s collective memory bank, but also so far removed that it felt like it didn’t really happen. Hope it makes the Documentary list for the Oscars next year The Mavis Staples - Mahalia Jackson footage is the most transfixed I’ve been to the screen this past year. That’s the best scene of any movie I’ve watched in awhile. 

The direction by Questlove is revelatory. Brilliant all around. It was really good but I wish they had more info on the original cinematographer who held onto the footage for 50 years and included some info about how this film came to be. 

I really appreciated they cultural context stuff - the moon landing stuff was really interesting and gave me a perspective on history I wasn’t taught in school. 

I really hope they can get the licenses together and put a compilation record out. It would be incredible.

The editing was great too. I just finished watching it and it is making me so hype. It’s not just about the music, and as a music teacher that is a total NERD for music history, this is incredible. But hot damn, the music (which I grew up with), is insanely phenomenal. I would buy the box set of this whole festival. One of the best music docs I’ve seen in a while. Excellent footage. Really loved this. I actually live across the street from Mt. Morris Park, and it was really incredible to think all of this took place right outside my window fifty years ago. I think my personal highlights were Mahalia Jackson letting the spirit of four hundred years pour right out of her, and then the end with Nina Simone being so amazing and powerful in the way that only she can. Well done, Questlove. If this were just a collection of performance footage, it would be four stars. The interviews and the culture/historical context push it to the top level. It was such a great decision to include so many interviews with regular festival-goers. 

Also, Stevie Wonder is a goddamn performer. Wow. I went into this looking forward to the music, and the music was spectacular. But about 30 minutes into it I was more interested in what Questlove was trying to say with the film. There are some insanely powerful moments in this movie.

Also, watch to the very end of the credits. There's a little clip at the end that's hilarious and worth waiting for. I saw this as part of Sundance's online festival this year.  It's really good, the archival film is great, some terrific performances, and great stories. Let’s not forget the Latino and African performers too. It was a great melding of so many genres. I hope we will see a release of full performances from all the bands/singers. The extended title of this film includes: **(or... When the Revolution Could Not be Televised)** 

and I feel like that's quintessential to the name of and discussion of the doc. Anyone know what that was all about with stevie at the end of the credits? This was amazing and beautiful. Can’t believe I didn’t know this happened or existed. Stellar performances, fantastic fashion, the colors and variety of artists. I’ll be honest, I teared up a few times. Wonderful. This was the uplifting watch I needed after that heavy Woodstock doc. Seeing Stevie go all out was amazing. It’s REALLY good. I was worried it would be more concert film than documentary, but it’s the PERFECT blend of both. Go watch this. Thank goodness for Questlove. His music history drive is truly amazing. 

Misty eyed from the second Little Stevie Wonder threw down on the drum set. Yeah i need a box set of this. Want to see the performances without commentary (even though its great) they did sonny sharrock dirty by only showing a tiny bit of his performance with all that other music/commentary on top of it. FREE JAZZ FOREVER Totally going to watch this now, thanks for the heads up. What a great film,  awesome music, and spectacular fashion and dances.

Amazing look at the era, and so much fun to see the artists watch themselves and get so emotional I guess I'm disappointed becuse it wasn't what i was expecting  i went in  expecting a modern-day Wattstax,  Not a  traditional documentary documentary reflecting on the  politics and music  and of the era and it's meaning to the black community which is fine. I'll  give  2nd chance now that i know that.

Still I feel quest love should have let the footage speak for it's self more. ",0
162," Man, the kid who played Young Saroo was phenomenal. Just a fantastic performance.

I really enjoyed the movie, except I felt like they rushed through Saroo's adopted childhood, and I would've liked to see more of that, to understand the dynamics between him and Mantosh. Man the scene where he finds home and meets his mom I thought was so well done. Well acted all around, had me tearing up.  Were...were those kids being taken as sex slaves? The type of rich, diverse stories that producers in the US should be buying/funding.  Great acting from both Saroos, great score (second only to Jackie, maybe?).  Two things that keep it from being overall great:  I think we needed more time with young Saroo in Australia and more time with adult Saroo before he becomes so obsessed.  As it is, it goes quickly from ""kid gets new home!"" to ""young adult still feels lost and kinda crazy"", and I could have used a little more of a bridge.  Awful, while the writing overall is pretty good, Nicole Kidman's speech about her vision of a brown boy in the field...brutal.  Overall, really good flick. How was Patel's Australian accent? Because from the snippets I heard from the trailer I thought it had the potential to be one of the best, if not the best, Australian accents of all time. I feel sorry for the real life Mantosh, whose portrayal in this film was pretty harsh. I don't recall the book suggesting he had drug problems. He interacts with the family and works for his dad's company. 

Judging by a comment on his Facebook page, he found the interpretation of his character offensive and hurtful.

Saroo handled it fairly sensitively in the book, not giving too much away, but they seem to have used stretched the limits of poetic license in the film. I'm really happy to see this thread. I was looking at an old one from before the movie came out and I found a lot of nasty comments about how Saroo was stupid because he didn't know his way home. We are all commenting on computers and technology that comes so easily to us that some people don't even realize their privilege. He knew how to get to his home by himself from places near by, but he ended up extremely far away. He mispronounced the name of a small village that might not have been on any map. The movie ended saying that 80,000 children are lost in a year, there aren't the resources to try everything to reunite each child. They put his picture in the news paper, but his family couldn't afford a news paper and a news paper may not have even reach their village. He was also uneducated and when moved in with his adoptive family, it was the first time he ever saw a map. Also, unlike in the countries most of us are from, I read that he feared going to the police, because they didn't help beggars and would just bring him to an orphanage. A lot of people on the street were unwilling to help and they ignored him. I was also heartbroken to see people call her a bad mother. Yes, in our privilege countries, parents would get in trouble for letting their child do all the things that he did and she would be considered a bad mother, but we don't understand that poverty: to not be able to feed your family, to work for hours and get maybe a rupee, to beg for scraps just to get by while still being hungry. Being a single parent is hard even in privileged countries (#spoiler) This movie fucked me up. Our problems are so trivial comparatively.

Beautiful film. Sunny Pawar should win best supporting actor, if not best actor, at the Oscars for real. So was the brother hit by the train that night? My friends and I thought the writing at the end was a tad confusing. It would have made sense if so because that's why he didn't come back for Saroo. Either way, so sad once we read that news :(

Really enjoyed the movie, I hadn't seen Dev Patel in anything since Slumbdog Millionaire, he's just FANTASTIC. He also got extremely handsome. Great movie. Definitely lopsided though, just because the first half was so much more engaging with young Saroo being so phenomenal and the stakes so much higher. Dev Patel was great but 10 minutes or so could've easily been shaved from the back half, or maybe shown more time in India.

I agree that Mara's character wasn't great... but the lowest point for me was the monologue by Kidman. I mean, most of it was powerful when she was talking about loving both kids and choosing not to adopt, but it really suffered from that bit about ""having visions at age 12 about adopting a little brown boy."" And she keeps referring to the kid as ""it."" And does this mean she refused to adopt asian or black kids because her vision specified the kid had to be brown? It was very silly and contrived. I wonder if it's because the real-life mother had a bit a religious streak that they felt obligated to touch upon.

All in all, definitely deserves the oscar nom although some flaws from the back half make it hard to say it deserves to win.

But seriously, Young Saroo running was the cutest fucking thing.  It was a good film, though there are some flaws. Rooney Mara's character felt like a tacked on love interest that barely affected the plot. It felt a little too serious or over-dramatized at times, I know the guy was troubled over his past but at times there could have been a few more moments of joy.

Still, it has a great musical score. The movie also managed to keep a great flow of the events, keeping it from losing suspense. Young Saroo was amazing. Really great perfomrance. Very believable. 

Those ""trafficking"" scenes really hurt and I still think about.  Held back a lot of tears at the end, especially the scene where [Kidman talks about how she can have children.  What a powerful scene.](#spoiler)  I am grown ass man and I found myself crying like a little bitch while watching this movie. I felt the worst for his bro Guddu. In some way he was spared the pain of not seeing his brother for the 25 years and probably feeling guilty for having taken him with him. This was just a purely emotional and beautiful movie.  I completely lost it with the bike riding flashback at the end on the train tracks... Haven't cried for a film that hard in a while. The first half in India is amazing. The last 20 minutes starting when Saroo stumbles upon his home town is amazing. That middle half hour was not very good and holds it back from being truly great.

The first 2/3 of the movie I kept thinking to myself ""Lion.....why is this movie called Lion? I'm sure there's some symbolism that'll show up later to clarify."" As the last act unfolded, I forgot all about it. Then those text overlays popped up at the end....added a great deal of frission to the emotions I was already feeling.

God damn those last twenty minutes are so powerful. Holy damn.

I agree with the criticism that Rooney Mara's character is wasted. His adoptive brother, though, I feel is a bit crucial to this movie. That relationship needed more attention. A big theme of this movie is the relationship between brothers. It starts and ends with Saroo and Guddu. Guddu is constantly appearing in his thoughts and dreams (more than his mom I felt like). There is definitely a thread here that the director tried to explore but it isn't very well realized.   I'm from Melbourne and it was so surreal seeing places I actually know on the big screen 

Ngl dev Patel nailed the accent  [deleted] Yes, so happy to see this discussion thread after posting [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5kv4xg/lion_and_its_unique_niche_in_the_oscarssowhite/) just a few days ago. I saw the movie and was so eager to discuss with others!

Overall, the movie was really moving and, in my mind, avoided a lot of the cliches that I  thought might be coming.  Sunny and Dev ably carry the entire movie and I thought they both did an outstanding job. 

Reading a little about the actual story, I would have liked to see more of the real details included in the movie (apparently he rode multiple local trains around Kolkata for a few days before leaving the train station) but understand why they weren't included. I would have also liked a little more backstory on the brother and delving more into Saroo's relationship with him vs that of his with Guddu. 

Did anyone else think it was odd that Saroo never mentioned his sister? I think it was because he was closer to his brother but it was odd that he only mentioned that his mother and brother were looking for him, but never mentioned Sheikla, his sister. 

I loved the cinematography - the overhead shots to mirror the shots from Google Earth were great. 

Not a dry eye in our theater at the end - I really loved it.  I'll tear up during a movie every now and then, but I full on cried like 4 times. Not a perfect movie by any means, but damn good.  I loved this movie portrayed being adopted and not really connecting with the culture of the country you were born in. When he had trouble eating with his hands, people asking where he is from, etc...

Being adopted myself I get this all the time. People asking if I celebrate Chinese new year, if I speak Chinese, if I loooooove rice, etc etc...

I think the movie handled it well and hopefully now more people understand. I was adopted as a baby, I don't remember anything and my parents are Canadians. I'm more Canadian than I will ever be Chinese. I loved this movie. As a whole I understand why some people thought it was slow in the middle, but I thought there were so many great scenes (the scene where the kids are learning the names of the utensils??? So great.) I cried hysterically about 100 times, but 3 scenes stick out to me:

-The scene where Saroo meets with the lady at the orphanage, and before he leaves he stops and asks, ""Did you really look for my Mum?"" Sunny Pawar absolutely slayed that scene and the actress playing the woman was great, too.

-The scene where Saroo meets his adoptive family. Nicole Kidman's face was so full of wonder.

-When old Saroo sees Ganesh Teile on Google Earth and says, ""Ami."" *cue me having a full on loud sob* Guddu? Who exactly was rama? That fuckin pervert was a pedo? Or was he a agent to get kids to beg for money???  [deleted] I went into this movie thinking it would be about animals and ended up getting the feels instead. ",1
3," The scene where he's talking about that hot shot chef's dream of opening a pub and the camera never leaves the chef's face as his soul just dies and leaves his body will be a contender for most memorable moment in a 2021 movie. He Ratatouille'd the dad Amir keeps listening to that audionarration about why classical music is great and will last forever. When we get to his Dad's house, classical music is playing. Amir is trying to emulate his invincible father even though he himself probably doesn't like the music. In the end he finally shuts off the narration and allows himself to mourn his mother in a way his father never would.

Fantastic film. Underrated moment: Robin stealing the bike and then rage screaming at the owner before the owner has a chance to even say, ""Hey, that's my bike!"" and then riding off. I was incredibly impressed with this movie. The way this was executed was just perfect for me. At first you think it's going to be like John Wick or Taken, especially with the descent into the underworld at Edgar's place. But then you find out who Rob really is and it just completely changes everything.

Him using his cooking skills and history to talk to people and break them down was incredible to watch, and the parallels between the loss of Apple to Amir's mom was very well done. Fantastic meditation on loss and grief, cannot recommend this enough. Really enjoyed the movie overall. Could have easily just been standard revenge porn, cause revenge is a satisfying fantasy to watch. But I'm so happy it was so much more than that. Has a lot to say about loss and pursuing happiness.

That said, do have a question and feel like I missed something. What was up with the fighting pit? Some place where we people pay money to hit people and watch people get hit? How did that tie in to Robyn's backstory? I didn't really hear the few lines he talked about it. I'm confused cause he was obviously known for being an amazing chef. I just got lost in how taking hits for money tied into all of that, and it really only played in for the first 1/3 of the movie. “Fuck Seattle.”

10/10

I really like how, because we’ve been groomed to think this way, that a violent scene is about to happen and he just handles it with words. Very nice change of pace. I want to see it again soon to soak more of it in. There's an undeniably powerful sub-theme that highlights the different ways in which people handle grief:
1) Rob: he shares with Amir in the diner that he feels as though if he never looked for his pig, she would still be alive in his head. He wishes he could have taken the ""ignorance is bliss"" approach after already experiencing crippling grief from his wife's passing.
2) Amir: He tries to convince himself that his mom is dead, and mentions this to Rob. It's easier for him to think of her in past tense.
3) Amir's Dad: following his self-serving tendencies, he delays his wife's death (to her detriment) in an attempt to presumably delay the grief that would come with it.

One last thought: though I was initially crushed for Rob at the end, I think Amir provides him with enough purpose to make it through, even if that means seeing him once every Thursday. Rob gave Amir some crucial fatherly experiences (e.g. showing him how to cook the meal at his dad's home) and Amir gave Rob care and conversation that he hadn't experienced in years. He's not alone, it's just the start of his third chapter of love. All of us Nicolas Cage fans finally getting vindication as people start to realize/remember that he is a very good actor Me watching this move with no prior info: 

5 minutes in: okay cool it's about a guy and his pig in the 1800s

15 minutes in: okay cool it's like taken but with a pig and not actually in the 1800s

30 minutes in: okay it's like john wick but with a pig

1 hour in: okay it's like ratatouille with a pig

1.5 hours in: okay it's none of those things and actually about coping with the loss of a loved one Robin said he remembers every meal he’s ever cooked and every person he’s ever served.

Robin cooked the same meal that Amir’s father and mother had the night they came back very happy and drunk. Causes the father to emotionally breakdown. 

I’m not entirely sure the deeper meaning behind the persimmon tree scene. This juxtaposition of this sweet boy showing Cage this instrument and Cage looking like a deranged bloody homeless man is something else though. 

“I don’t think we have a persimmon tree.”

“No? That’s okay.”

“Did it die?”

…

There’s also the moment when he yells at the dude after he swipes the bike. 

Small tidbit - Laurie died in 2004, which would be 15 years from of 2019. He had left industry 15 years ago. 

Beautiful cinematography and definitely a story that will make you ponder the themes for a while. It certainly wasn’t the movie I was expecting based on the trailer but that’s not a bad thing. Without a doubt this is the best movie that I've seen since the theatres reopened.    
If you haven't seen this yet, go see it!  This director is amazing!    
And Nicholas Cage is absolutely fantastic.  This is his best performance since Leaving Las Vegas.  I really hope that either Cage or Alex Wolff get nominated for awards!  They deserve it. This isn’t the kind of movie that a lot of people expect it to be, but it’s pretty damn good nonetheless. 

And while this clearly isn’t a comedy, I did have a good chuckle at the “sentimental cooking scene” where Cage is *still* covered in blood lol That'll do, 'Pig'. Man he played the tape at the end and I realized it was going to be a song and eerily felt like it was going to be a Springsteen song. So weird. I'm a huge Bruce fan and ""I'm on fire"" always gets to me. Good cover Is there anyone else but Nic Cage who could pull off this breathtaking meditation on love and loss and also give a deadpan serious reading of the line, *”I don’t fuck my pig.”* I sobbed. Great movie. This was an astoundingly nice little film.  And we need more of this.  More MCU and Antman is fine, but these little weird movies have so much love to give.  

I did, however, constantly wish he washed his face.  But he DID wash his hands for the “big dinner” I saw it last night. It was a very good movie, but my favorite part was as I was walking out of the theater, I heard the couple in front of me talking. The woman said, ""Man, we shoulda gone to see Space Jam. This was some weird shit."" Saw this in the theater last night and really loved it. One of the best movies I've seen so far this year and I'm hoping to watch it again soon. Nicolas Cage is fantastic. I hope that dude decided to open his pub in the end. Follow your dreams, people. Ok so I just watched this with my partner. During the movie we thought it was a odd but a beautiful story. At the end, or the 'reveal' my partner burst into tears because she felt so sorry for him, she has only ever cried from one other movie, so this was a very rare reaction. When the credits rolled she quietly cried again. Did anyone else have this same reaction? I felt a slight sense of sorrow, but definitely far from tears myself. [deleted] I hope everyone that likes to meme on Nic Cage watches this movie. Dude is an incredible actor. He's probably not going to get an Oscar for this performance but he deserves one. Caught this in Philly earlier today. The fullest i've ever seen the indie theater since Shape of Water. Did the entire film look a bit washed out and too bright to anyone else?

Fantastic acting, fantastic screenwriting. I teared up a few times. As somebody else here said, it leaves a lot unsaid and expects the audience to pay attention to clues and things said in passing to have a full understanding of the situation. I also appreciated how it used comedy- even in grief, sometimes shit is just funny. The film also played with my expectations with dividing it into two parts. There was no three act structure. The second part never ends. There is no chapter for resolution. The first part is when he has his pig and the second part is the rest of his life when she is taken from him. Brooding.

I also felt that the film had some good commentary on gentrification and catering to a rich but tasteless audience. 

Funny things in the credits: pig is credited about halfway through but does not appear in cast in order of appearance. The dishes served in the film have credits right at the end. Special thanks to Janet Weiss (rocky horror? Lol) ",0
25," Okay but heart fucking broke when I saw Bruno’s table setting. That has to be the most quietly heartbreaking things I’ve ever seen in a Disney movie. ""We Don't Talk About Bruno."" Proceeds to have the best musical number in the film about Bruno. So the cousin can't keep a secret for 5min at dinner but has been hearing Bruno in the walls for how many years and never bothered to mention it..? mirabel’s gift being bringing her family to reality was such a great peaceful resolution, but i really wish we saw what kind of room casita built for her! after all that work repairing generational trauma she deserves all
the sewing machines and skeins of yarn she wants. I just want to mention the yellow butterflies. They are an iconic piece of One Hundred Years of Solitude that have become a symbol for Colombia and magical realism, meaning the occurrence of life and joy in the middle of grim circumstances. I had a big smile when one of them showed up in the river by the end of the movie, it was kind of the same story told once again.

But the first time we saw a yellow butterfly was when they show Mariano in love with Isabela, resembling Mauricio Babilonia’s character in the book, who was always followed by yellow butterflies when in love.

Edit: my first award! Thank u! They really, really captured Colombia. Down to the father saying ""miercoles"" as a euphemism. The entire time the family was singing “We Don’t Talk About Bruno,"" all I could think of was, “Silenzio, Bruno!” Crossover universe between Luca and Encanto confirmed. I haven't seen it posted already so I'll just comment this: Mirabel's skirt/dress is beautifully animated, and it really popped to me during The Family Madrigal. Can't wait to see this again, probably in 3D this time. I loved this movie. Surface Pressure was definitely my favorite song. Bawled like a bitch throughout the movie. I was happy that there was no real villan. Its true the grandma was a huge fuckin asshole, but I wouldnt classify her as a villain. Just a dick. And once she had her eyes opened to how her dick behavior had negatively impacted her family, she changed. I do wish she had a more over time transition though. Kinda seems like she just got slapped in the face with the consequences of her actions and then was like ""oh shit what have I done"" and that was that. Otherwise, I had a great time seeing it and Ill prolly get it on dvd when its out So, I don't know if I'm crazy here, but everything on the internet is stating that there is ""no physical antagonist"" in this movie and that the antagonist is more thematic in terms of ""generational trauma"" but....Abuela Alma is like, ABSOLUTELY the antagonist here right?  Like, just because she learns her lesson doesn't make her behavior less downright toxic to the other members of her family for a healthy chunk of the movie... Just saw it, loved it. Some observations:

- The shape-shifting cousin had chameleons on his poncho. I didn't notice this til the end, but what a nice detail.

- Of course Bruno's visions are glass panes. What is glass made of? Sand.

- Recognized Abuela's voice from In The Heights immediately, which was cool. Didn't realize til afterwards that Mirabel was in the movie version as well.

- All the musical sequences. I'm a slut for musical sequences in animation and these were all incredible. We Don't Talk About Bruno is of course the stand-out one. Can't wait til that's on Youtube to rewatch it and soak in more of the animation details.

- Speaking of Bruno, I did think his character design looked a little young, which was kind of odd? I remember seeing shots of him in one of the trailers a few weeks ago and thinking ""okay, that guy's gotta be our love interest character"". Oops. My family and I have been singing ""We Don't Talk About Bruno"" nonstop since last night.

Such an earworm. Question, Mirabel was basically ostracized because she didn’t have a gift and in her Abuela’s eyes could not help their community. But who the hell was Camilo helping with his gift? How can shapeshifting really help anyone? Honestly, I really loved it which is why it's shortcomings were so pronounced to me. The visuals were gorgeous, and the notion of having it set essentially in one house is a concept that I loved. The powers were all very cute and interesting. But the plot pacing was so, so strange. One major instance I can remember was >!the fight between the main character and the grandma!<. I feel like that should have happened halfway through the movie, but it happened like 85% in - it was resolved essentially immediately after. Or how >!the sisters can't stand each other, but after a short song they are completely in sync!<. The begining and end felt so brief, but the middle was really long. Don't get me wrong, it was the best part of the movie, but the pacing was really not doing it for me. I also felt that the music was tired and really unremarkable. The songs didn't push the plot forward much and felt like a desperate attempt to reach the top 10 charts. I know it's to be expected at this point, but it still was upsetting to hear. I can't remember a single song - even if you played it to me, I wouldn't be able to tell you it was in the movie. Bruno is a perfect character Kinda gets easily overlooked but can we appreciate the fact they actually had people of different skin tones in the family instead of easily making everyone white or the same tone. Accurate for Colombia. Did anyone else feel Pepa (aunty tied to the weather) was a subtle representation of mental illness? It seemed she always had clouds and was battling her anxiety throughout. I quite liked that it wasn't made into a big deal - it was (and is) just part of life. I realized something while watching this movie and it’s that I’m not a fan of how Disney animated their musical numbers anymore because of how many cutaways they have to something that doesn’t exist. Old Disney movies used to use songs to broaden the world. For example, One Jump Ahead in Aladdin making the streets of Agrabah come alive, A Girl Worth Fighting For from Mulan showing the Chinese countryside and the citizens that the army was protecting. The Circle of Life is probably the best example of this, showing us just how impressive the lions rule over the pride lands is and setting the stage perfectly for the rest of the movie.

Meanwhile, in modern Disney movies half of the songs don’t even take place in the setting they’re being sung in, characters are transported off to mystical dreamscapes where they fall through clouds and interact with metaphorical representations of what they’re singing about. See: You’re Welcome in Moana, Summer in Frozen, and Surface Pressure in Encanto. I dunno, I feel like it makes the world feel more shallow and thin for a few quick gags Lin Manuel Miranda's songwriting is so tied to his singing voice that I honestly couldn't listen to any of the songs in this movie without hearing his voice in the back of my head. What is happening at Disney? All their films recently feel like messes. Full of great ideas, great characters, beautiful imagery - but meandering stories struggling to link these things together. Is the plot an afterthought in development? I’m colombian, this movie was amazing. the fact that the family was displaced by violence is not something id ever see in a disney movie. Colombia has been in one conflict or another for like 100 years and most of the books that come out of Colombia are heavily related to that, is unfortunately, a huge part of what Colombia is. 

Also, i felt that the ashes were a reference to Armero, but that might be a stretch. 

Overall I’m severely pleasantly surprised, this was beyond my expectations and we’ll see it a few more times 


My fav song was dos orugas, tho it felt just so relatable because of my recent breakup. The grandmother scene where she explains her origins was just heartbreakingly beautiful. Not a dry eye in my theater i realized: does abuela have a gift? her central role is to act as the leader of the family without any additional assistance of magic guiding everyone else in her influence. if anything then mirabel wasn’t the first one to not be granted a direct power. she as herself is enough to lead others with love - she takes after her grandmother in this regard. her grandmother puts so much of their family’s success squarely on the magic thinking of herself as  not enough to take care of everyone depending on her without the magic. as much as the movie is about mirabel understanding she is enough the grandmother is enough as well. they are both worthy of the love of others without condition. This… wasn’t a good movie, it was ok at best.  It looked great, but the story and songs were just all off.  Nobody is going to be singing these songs like any of the 90s Disney classics. It's so beautiful to see my country represented like this, specially the Donkeycorn ",0
128," Wouldn’t it be nice to spend a whole summer reading books and listening to music in your underwear? I’m jealous. Has anyone here actually stuck their thing into a peach/apricot before? Is that actually a thing teenagers did/do and I just missed the memo at the time? I absolutely love this one, however I was deeply offended when Timothée, without a single care, allowed the juices from the peach to drip onto the bed sheets. I mean, good heavens, that was wrong. “To feel nothing so as not to feel anything, what a waste”. Damn. That quote is gonna stay with me a while Armie Hammer needs to make more movies where he dances. There were many scenes in this movie that stuck with me, most of which have probably been discussed to death here (the dad, the peach, the sheer pleasure of sitting around reading, swimming, and doing whatever you want unsupervised).

I think as an American, one of the things that stuck to my bones was how the parents reacted to their son's sexuality. I don't mean his homosexuality. I mean, sexuality as a whole. Despite most of the key characters being American, they all have a European sensibility that it very rare to see here in the US. One could argue that the movie itself could be making a social comment about open, honest European views of sex vs. moralizing, restrictive American views.

First, the parents see their son is attracted to a man, so they do things to help facilitate that attraction by giving them the idea to travel alone together. They also let Elio and Oliver have their space in the house - they aren't monitoring Elio or ""checking up on him,"" which I found refreshing.

Second, the parents are genuinely always there for Elio in helping him discuss sexual relationships. He is able to say to his parents out loud, ""I could never be that open,"" a vulnerable statement I have trouble imagining expressing to my parents. They simply reassure him; they don't nag or moralize him about sex. Of course, there's the scene with the father discussing his own sexual past and desires, openly and without judgment that exemplifies this behavior.

Third, the adults in the movie treat Elio respectfully with regards to his sexual encounters. For example, when Elio greets the older gay couple with Marzia and quickly gives her a kiss and loving pat, the adults simply maturely greet her and say hello. No one says ""Ohhhhhhh! You have a GIRRRLFRIENND!!!!!!!!!"" In the US, I find it typical that adults make teasing comments and condescending ""jokes"" about ""how cute it is to have a crush"" to teenagers. This moralizing can make teens internalize that they are doing something wrong, when they are actually doing something natural.

To see adults treat Elio respectfully and collegially, like a mature young adult for whom sex is one of many natural, positive experiences, filled me with hope, jealousy, and a strong feeling about the kind of parent I'd like to be if/when I have teenagers. It's not very common you walk out of a movie thinking, ""This movie has changed or informed the way I want to live my life"" but this one has for me.

Last, I think we are in a particular time where we are really looking back on the 1980s with a specific nostalgia for a time when kids could just be kids, ride their bikes everywhere, have adventures, be home for dinner, then go out again and have more unsupervised adventures. Stranger Things, It, and CMBYN all are really tapping in to that nostalgia, albeit in slightly different ways. That brief 4th wall break at the end of Visions of Gideon... it just hit something very emotionally raw in me. The monologue from Michael Stuhlbarg is probably my favourite scene in any movie this year. I think about it a lot. It affected me so much I had to call my dad after to talk. While I thought Elio and Oliver make the perfect couple, I did feel bad for Marzia. The moment Elio gets Oliver he completely forgets about her and when she confronts him about it, he's like ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  Fun Fact: Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet stayed and bonded on location a month before the actual filming. They got ample time to know each other very well and spend time with each other doing most of what happened in the movie too. 

And they admittedly said that this is the primary reason why their on-screen chemistry really worked and felt so genuine.

In my opinion, their on-screen chemistry is one of the best and most authentic I’ve ever seen. You can really feel their intimacy especially during the sensual scenes. And that’s why them parting really affected me deeply.  This is one of the most **A E S T H E T I C** movies I've seen.

Not just in the sense that it's sensually arresting and just beautiful to look at but that all the Greek sculptures and 80s setting reminds me of Macintosh Plus. that final shot is going to stay with me for a very long time  My favourite scene is when Elio is sitting at the station trying not to cry. A lot of Timothee's performance comes from trying not to show his emotions, that's what makes it so great. Was Elio joking when he asked Oliver on the phone if he's getting married? 

 Like Oliver says ""I've got good News"" and Elio says ""What, you're getting married?"". I took that to believe Elio was looking for an answer like... ""I'm coming back next summer"". Anyone else?  This may fall on deaf ears but I thought the costume design was great.  Did anyone else feel like the story kept baiting and switching typical romance/gay tropes.

I thought the notebook Elio left on the bed would get discovered, it didn’t.

I thought maybe Oliver and Elio’s papers would get mixed up in the backpack but they didn’t.

I thought they would get caught having sex but they didn’t.

Maybe this last one is a stretch but I kinda expected that call at the end to be about AIDS but it wasn’t (I’m blaming that on watching Dallas Buyers Club a couple days prior). Sorry Cum Peach... Cum Turkey Baster still has you beat in the cum isn't supposed to go in there Award.

Also... My favorite piece of CMBYN trivia

> Regarding the peach scene, Luca Guadagnino went to Timothée Chalamet and told him that he had tried it out himself and it was in deed possible to do, so therefore he thought they should do the scene. Chalamet responded by saying he had also tried it and agreed to do the scene.

 I loved all of the random side characters and scenes (like the fish scene). Such a great way to establish the environment more fully. Beautiful movie Sufjan is one of my favorites artist and seeing his music fit so well with it’s heartbreaking scenes  “Not a straight body in these statues, they’re all gay.” My pick for best movie of 2017. 

I just loved the whole atmosphere of this film, from the music to the pacing to the naturalistic acting. I think it was refreshing to see an LGBT romance that was allowed to be just that, a romance, without focusing on any sort of overt obstacle like violent aggressors, disapproving parents, AIDS, etc. (Although I would understand if people think that makes the film disingenuous). 

Everyone always talks about Timothee's last scene, and deservedly so, but I was super impressed with his physical acting throughout the whole film, as he clearly has some strong instincts as an actor that are rare for someone his age.  Can we please talk about the flies? Those weren't coincidental. Anyone have any take away from them?

My biggest was the way in which they represented us the audience. I truly felt like a fly on the wall just observing someone's experience similarly to how I did when I saw Boyhood. I was almost uncomfortable during the sex scenes because it felt like something I shouldn't be seeing because it's their moment and they should be able to have it without spectators. Just got out of this movie. It was...devastatingly beautiful. It’s a movie that I’ll be thinking about for a while. 

I’m a bisexual Indian-American guy who didn’t grow up in the cultured natural paradise that Elio lives in, or with parents as open-minded as his are. What’s more, I haven’t ever felt ~~true love~~ powerful, intense, passionate obsessive infatuation like Elio did. His experience should have felt totally alien to me. Yet, I felt his infatuation, frustration, passion, heartbreak as if they were my own. Chalamet did a phenomenal job. 

The cinematography was great. The languid and lingering shots, and even the abrupt jumps, made it feel like a long yet fleeting summer. 

The father’s monologue at the end nearly had me in tears, especially when he told Elio not to suppress his sadness. And that credit sequence...oh man.

There were parts that fell a bit flat for me. The pacing was a bit off at times, and the romance did seem a bit rushed initially. However, overall, I am very happy I saw this movie, and have a feeling I’ll revisit it time and again. I could watch Michael Stuhlbarg read an encyclopedia. 

Easily my favorite film of the year.  As a gay man, I had a very hard time watching this movie the first time through. The ""moment of discovery"" is so ubiquitous in gay romances like this, that I spent the whole film anxious waiting for the shoe to drop. I went back and watched it again with the knowledge that it never does and enjoyed the film even more the second time.

It truly is one of the greatest ""first love""  movies I've ever seen. The phone call at the end was the standout for me. Timothy Chalamet deserves an oscar nod for that scene alone. You can physically see all his feelings slamming into him. It's a truly outstanding showcase of subtle physicality. He's officially added to my list of must-watch actors. Well, I've been sitting on this for about a month and having seen the movie twice now I can say it's one of my favorite movies of all time. I was excited for this movie for a while, but still didn't expect to be completely floored by the entire thing.

This movie is a masterpiece and the best portrayal of firsts (sex, love, heartbreak) I have ever seen. Everything in the movie felt so real, it truly brings you back to your first love. It makes you feel the wave of emotions that you felt the first time you fell in love.

Timothee Chalamet gives an absolutely mesmerizing performance in this movie. I can't begin to express how talented he is. He completely encompasses Elio. Honestly the first time around I barely even took note of the other amazing performances here because my eyes were glued to Timothee the whole time. Armie Hammer is fantastic as well, I was able to relate to him and his role in the situation. He is very conflicted, sometimes warm, sometimes cold. And Michael Stuhlbarg is great as well, he has such a presence on screen.

The music in this movie is what I can only describe as beautiful, Sufjans songs in particular stand out as incredibly moving. Visions of Gideon is an absolute soul crusher. The music added to the atmosphere of the movie, which was so warm and peaceful. It was so refreshing to see a movie about two men in a relationship that didnt end with one of them dying or angry parents, nothing of the sort. Time is the villain here, and I think that makes it all the more tragic.

I will say while I love the movie, it didn't have the profound effect it did on me until the scene with Mr. Perlman near the end. I'm not someone who is easily affected by movies and shows but that monologue destroyed me. It's a universal message to anyone feeling pain and on a more personal note something I needed to hear. I had been pushing away and trying to just forget certain things in my life but after seeing this movie I felt a whirlwind of emotions that led me to finally being able to be happy about past relationships rather than bitter. I guess you could say this movie changed my life and how I view relationships going forward.

Overall, Call Me By Your Name is a deeply moving film about love with a fantastic performances, amazing atmosphere, and a few scenes that will stick with you (the monologue, Elio by the fire). I can't recommend it enough.  ",1
112," This thread is for the US release of the film. [You can go here to see the original international thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a4qfoa/official_discussion_aquaman_international_thread/) why is Randall Park the only asian that can get work in big movies? So that one bad guy is just hanging out head first in a toilet still. Right? This movie was so much unexpected fun. The opening Kidman fight scene, the tsunami sequence, the action scene in Sicily, the trench sequence - so so many amazing moments.  Best waterbender movie Black Manta and his pre scuba form flat out looked like GIJOE figures Is this the first superhero movie to end with both parents alive and well? THE RING....OF FIIIIRRREEE!!!!

SHARKBAIT WOO HAHA Never seen so much color in DCEU before Aquaman Fun fact: the pilot in the Sahara Desert scene was Leigh Wannell, long-time James Wan collaborator and director of this year’s *Upgrade*. Things I wasn’t expecting in this movie:

1. Jurassic Park

2. Africa by Toto cover by Pitbull Was that 5 conversations interrupted by explosions?  What was King Atlan trying to do on Atlantis when he made it sink? Like the equivalent of sticking a fork in an outlet but he sunk an entire civilization.  My lord, this was fun.

Was a bit clunky and silly but good god, James Wan is a madman.  By the time he finally gets the suit (and trident), the movie just delivers the madness all the way through that final freeze-frame.

I also really loved that neither Black Manta or Ocean Master were killed and it was nice to see the parents get a happy ending!!!! During the ring of fire battle, under ocean master i saw the following

king of atlantis 

warrior 

coral heart medal of valor 

5x undefeated champion

For aquaman under cons it says:

surface dweler- half breed- drunk  Amber Heard and Jason Momoa are both so damn fine How tf they just gonna brush over how Aquaman got out of the middle of the Sahara Desert  The emotive eyes on Orm’s helmet were amazing.

Whatever they end up doing for Batman or Red Hood or anyone with the domino masks I really hope they cgi some expressive white eyes on them. So much better than static masks. I counted 4 scenes of 2 characters talking and a sudden explosion from the side knocked them down. I didn’t realize how incomplete my life truly was until I saw an Octopus playing 8 different drums simultaneously. It definitely wasn't perfect, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a blast with this film. The zoomed out shot of Arthur and Mera diving into the ocean with the flare surrounded by the trench creatures was freakin' awesome. Also really liked the camera angles/movements for the action shots. Definitely my favorite that DC has put out so far. Definitely down for a sequel! I love that the final fight between Aquaman and King Orm looked like a boss fight in Injustice I definitely got chocked up when he came out from the water fall finally wearing the armor. 

I loved this movie! But I am a shameless Jason Momoa fan and I would have watched him swim in a pool for 2 and a half hours. It was awesome seeing Dolph Lundgren in two big movies this season. Hello Ms Andrews, I'm James Wan and I'm directing the superhero movie called Aquaman. How would you like to voice an enormous underwater monster that's gonna end up biting sharks while being ridden by Jason Momoa? ",0
65," I went into this movie expecting nothing and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Great acting, cool cast, and they made a very difficult topic understandable. 

Questions: 

At the end of movie when Vanessa Kirby is with the little girl do you think this was a fantasy or did she actually have another daughter with someone else in the future? 

Do you think the midwife was at fault for the baby's death? Not that she intended to or that she was a bad person, but should she have called the ambulance sooner or better explained what was going on to the parents? 

Do you think Shia's behavior after his daughter's death was more because of grief, his relapse, or was he just pretending to be a sweet partner in the beginning? I can't get over him just leaving and going to Seattle. It seems like it was more than simply depression. First act was very impactful, but it kind of fell apart from there:

-Is the cousin a prosecutor or a private sector attorney? She has an office like she runs a firm, but then they say it's a criminal trial.

-The attorney's dialogue about the case is poorly written. ""It's an open & shut case"", etc. It just doesn't seem like they took that part seriously.

-You could have a whole separate movie about the ethical dilemma of filing charges against, or suing your midwife. Here it seems like an afterthought, i.e. the movie needed a climax. Why couldn't this story just be about the marriage turning to shit?

-They never really conveyed the malfeasance of the midwife! What did she do wrong?

-That marital rape scene was very unsettling, but in any other movie, it'd carry a lot more weight. I mean, that was seriously disturbing, but in the wake, it seems like ""boy, their marriage sure is falling apart.""

-Did Shia LaBeouf have a merkin?!? Movie itself was kind of unspectacular beyond the first act sequence, but Vanessa Kirby is great. The internalization of her character's grief remind me a lot of Manchester by the Sea. I really hope Ellen Burstyn gets nominated because she was wonderful in this.

The whole apple metaphor was some film student bullshit though lmao. It’s rare for a film to feature a Safdie brother and not have him involved in the tensest scene Vanessa Kirby is spectacular at conveying her inner pain, guilt, and conflictions.

I thought Pieces of a Woman was captivating throughout and I'm honestly surprised people are saying it fizzles out after the initial 30 minute one take. You are with her and her suffering the entire time as well as how this awful tragedy has affected the lives of everyone they know.

I just wasn't crazy about the apple tree obscured final shot. I’m still trying to process the movie (just watched it last night). One thought that does come to mind, and maybe is an unpopular opinion after having read most of the comments, is my feeling towards Shia’s character. Although I don’t agree with his aggressive/sexual behavior, I can understand his feelings. Martha became completely cold and in her own way of dealing with grief shut out her husband. They didn’t have conversations together, make decisions about the child together, she didn’t even actually care when she knew he had an affair. It’s disappointing he took the money and left but in response to some people’s question on here “did he ever care?”. I think he cared a lot. I know everyone loves the first 30 minutes, and I do too, but I also love how the rest of the movie has me constantly trying to remember what happened in the first 30 minutes. We have the luxury of being able to review the text, but in real life and for the characters this is impossible. 

I love Shia and Kirbys performances even if the plot was slightly Ho-hum. 

I would also be interested to hear or read any birthworkers impressions of the midwife in the beginning. As someone who has been trained as a doula, but never attended a birth or pursued it professionally, I did think it was weird how little she communicated with Martha about the baby’s heart rate, etc. I know she was a “back-up” but in my opinion that would make me more eager to communicate and transfer to hospital. I wish her character had more screen time. Questions about Sean.

1. Why did he throw the hat in the car when he was leaving to Seattle?

2. Why was he so quick to take the $ and leave Martha during a terrible time in their lives. It doesn't even seem like there was even a conversation involved between Sean and Martha before he left.  

3. He seemed relatively nice and caring in the beginning, then became cold and emotionless at the end. Did he ever care?

Thats all for now. 

Thanks in advance for the responses. Honestly this movie isn’t that bad. Yeah it gets melodramatic but it still kept my attention. I really can’t wait to see Kirby in the world to come Man, that was a heavy movie. Really turned on the waterworks at moments. Especially the beginning, I went in reading or watching nothing about. I was so stressed the baby wasn't gonna make it, when she came out alive I already got teary eyed. And then... 

Both Shia and Vanessa Kirby were spectacular. It did get a little dull at the middle. The movie was also quite confrontational, I really felt bad for the nurse as well. I get they were just hurt, but everyone was treating her like a murderer. Also the mom really got on my nerves sometimes, let people work out their problems in their own way. Felt like she was pushing her too hard to cope the way she wanted her to cope. Spoilers

>!The only problem I had with this movie was the relationship between Martha and Sean. It didn't seem like Sean was helping Martha at all with her grief. And the fact that the mother pays for Sean to leave and takes the money just like that shows he's a low character. He could at least have a heart and stay for his wife while she grieves. The plot was kind of misleading acting like the movie would be about their relationship after this tragedy when it was more about Martha. And I'm honestly glad the midwife didn't get in trouble at the end since I did blame more Martha. It was true that Sean told her she should go to a hospital and she said no. Maybe the baby would have had a better chance of living if she was born in the hospital in case an emergency happened.!< I was expecting more after hearing about it, but I did enjoy the film. Especially Vanessa Kirby's performance. The opening sequence was amazing and then the rest of the film didn't sustain the tone or quality we expected after the first act.

By the way - if my snobby, rich mother told me that if I had followed her advice my baby wouldn't have died I never would have spoken to that b\*\*\*\* again. Kirby killed it. Burstyn had excellent moments that might carry her to a supporting nom.

Sucks that Shia's personal assholery came out, the guy again comes through with a good performance

Interesting Cast- A Safdie, Iliza Shlesinger, and Shiv from Succession (no booty shots, sad face lol), all did well with their roles.

Funny nitpick- Shias character is clearly poor and not as educated as Kirby or her family, yet he did marry a high level corporate executive, and had an affair with her very well off lawyer cousin. BDE triumphs all lol the use of sigur ros during the birth scene just wasn't fair, i knew i was gonna cry but fuck.

echoing everyone else - vanessa kirby carried this movie on her back. learning after the fact that its based on a play makes a whole lot more sense. i feel like only kirby's character and the mother are the only ones that matter, no one else needed to exist I find the reaction to Shia very interesting because I am positive that, if not for the likelihood (though I'd be happy to be proven wrong) that he beats women. Because, divorcing yourself from that...his performance is amazing and would definitely be getting a shit ton of hype. But now, people won't even acknowledge it. 1. Vanessa Kirby's portrayal of an extremely difficult delivery is all the more impressive when you consider, as far as I can tell, she has never been pregnant herself.

2. The whole legal plot annoyed the hell out of me because of how inaccurate and unrealistic it was.

- Someone dying of a medical emergency does not automatically mean criminal charges are filed against the person whose care they were under. DAs do not like bringing cases they aren't likely to win and getting a murder/manslaughter conviction against a doctor/nurse/etc is virtually impossible unless you can prove they were incredibly reckless.

- If such a case were going forward, it would be handled by the district attorney where they live. You can't retain a private attorney to file a criminal case (as the family seemed to be doing with the cousin) because private citizens/attorneys don't file criminal cases. 

- Martha and Sean basically had no involvement in the case whatsoever. If there was a criminal case against their midwife, they would be meeting with prosecutors, they'd be having their depositions taken, they'd be asked to testify at the trial. The movie made it seem like neither of them actually participated in any way (other than Sean's hookup with the lawyer). This is very minor point but as 29 year old still childless woman I am pleased the description calls 32 year old Vanessa Kirby as “young mother” although I am pretty sure she would not be in medical terms. 

Anyway, it took me a couple of days for me to watch the film so I don’t know if people will red this comment. But in any case, I think the opening was very strong with the one take birth. Most of the film spend its time with cliched reactions to death or a child. And it seemed odd the way the film was titled that it was the man who had most of the meat of the story, even if the woman was treated as idealized (by the film, your mileage might vary on her character). I feel it would have been a better choice to limit the point of view to her or if both were used to tell the story then have both on equal footing or focus on them going through this together. The characters aren’t much beyond man and woman either, but the story seems like a collection of several strories of what happens after a tragedy put together and made visual. The ending is easy to see coming even though it ought to have been the strongest point in the film. The film is still worth a watch, but mainly Kirby’s performance is the drawing point unless you are very passionate about the subject at hand This movie was pretty heavy at times. 

Agree with everyone that after the home birth, the movie slowly loses steam as it heads towards its ending. Individually, I liked most of the scenes on its own but there were threads that didn’t really lead anywhere by the end.

Question though: Sean and the mother were pursuing the court case together but why does she suddenly decide to pay him off to leave before the trial? He suffers through grief, loses sobriety, cheats on his spouse and spirals but then he just gets paid off and ultimately proves the mother right with her suspicions about his character (which she’d had against him pre-trauma). Was she just taking advantage of the situation to finally get him out of the picture or something? A couple questions:

Did anyone catch how much the cheque was for?

Was Martha’s mother in the early stages of dementia? 

Was the apple tree at the end meant to be one she planted? Because it looked way too old. After the first 30 minutes, it’s never as great. 

And it’s one scene too long. Should’ve ended n be bridge, not that fairytale-like apple tree scene. After all the buzz this has gotten, I was disappointed - it wasn't as good as I was expecting. I feel like there's a better version of this film in here. Like the bones are all good - the actors are great, you have this very traumatic and realistic event happening that exposes the cracks in all of these relationships but the problem is that the movie doesn't do enough with all of it, to be honest. I just left with so many questions. Why were Martha and Sean together to begin with? Why did Martha's cousin hook up with Sean? Why did Martha want to donate the body to science? 

I wish the film had allowed us some more insight into Martha's thoughts. I didn't need a big breakdown scene but I wanted to understand more of what she was thinking at different moments. That being said, I really loved the courtroom scene, the birth sequence was also great and I do think that Kirby was fantastic. While Ellen Burstyn was also good, I found her major monologue hard to believe and it felt like it came out of nowhere. I wish the sister had had more to do. 

I really liked the second to last scene with the ashes but really didn't like the final scene with the daughter. I know they wanted to leave it on a positive note but not every couple who loses a child ends up having another one. For some people, it just never happens and I felt like ending it on that note could alienate the people who have been in that place and who weren't able to have another child who survived. Besides, the bridge scene was positive enough - she had found some sort of peace and started to move on. That is very encouraging. Underwhelming movie outside of the opening act. Idk this is an Oscar picture but doesn’t really doesn’t live up to that opening 15 minutes. 6/10 Why are Benny Safdie and especially Iliza Shlesinger in this movie? Why is Ellen Burstyn playing Vanessa Kirby's mom when she's 56 years older than her? It wasn't anything noteworthy besides Vanessa Kirby's performance (definitely a lock for multiple award nominations), but I did like what it was trying to accomplish. It felt like this film was more trying to show the void left in her life following the loss of her child rather than just focus on her emotions following it. In fact, I don't think Kirby's character ever had any major breakdown scenes like we usually come to expect with these kind of movies. It was never overly emotional and there wasn't really a dramatic conclusion where she realized she would be alright. Instead, she just moves on. It's hard to make a compelling movie when the main character slouches around for most of it, but I do think it was very realistic which was refreshing to see. ",0
29," I cooka da pizza Did anyone else feel it ended kind of abruptly/weirdly? The jump from the murder to the trial was a bit much I thought it was cartoonish, but fun. They should have called it *A Gucci Movie*. Maurizio smiled his way through the first two hours... LG and Pacino are easy noms for their categories

Leto… that’s a bit much pal. Thought he was gonna look to the camera and ask where da freakin’ gabagool was at one point What did everyone think of the accents?

I remember Salma Hayek talking about how she worked with a dialect coach who thought Lady Gaga sounded Russian. The irony to me is Salma Hayek sounded like… Salma Hayek. Laughed out loud at the cut when Leto is about to scream and we just hear his car horn instead. Between that and the sudden cut to Jeremy Irons dead in a casket the editor was clearly having fun just wilding out.

For most of the movie I was wondering why we were sitting through so many scenes with this ridiculous tarot card reader, then she ends up becoming a pivotal part of the plot. Kinda wish Scott cut a few of her scenes, though, this really didn't need to be 157 mins long. After seeing Leto's performance in this, it's clear the role of Mario in the Mario movie was miscast. So did Dominico steal Gucci from the family? It seems thats what the filmmakers want us to think. He seems to be the reason the father never signed the cert. he knew about the forgery. He took over the company No browns, no pastels. Is it possible for an actor to win an Oscar and a Razzie for the same role? Because I think that might apply for Leto here. I wish we got the movie the trailers promised. I enjoyed it, don't get me wrong, but the trailers promised more of a family takeover struggle/drama but instead it mostly glossed over and skipped between different events very quickly. It was more of...I guess a long sequence of short scenes. Good performances all around, interesting story (I wasn’t familiar with any Gucci history going into it), but definitely didn’t need a nearly 2 hour 40 minute runtime. Overall I enjoyed it. I bet it will do well at the box office. Anyone who liked this should watch All the Money in the World which has a lot of similarities including the same director. I enjoyed it, but there were a few parts I didn’t understand and I was wondering if anyone might be able to help me. 
 1. What was the significance of the man watching Adam Driver’s character in the very beginning of the movie? We see a man watching him from a car, and also from the riverbank when he’s on the boat. Who was that guy? 
2. I was confused about the unsigned will. Did Jeremy Irons’ character leave it unsigned on purpose, or was there some manipulation at play? And then later on, was this the same document that turned up with the forged signature? If so, the movie never explained who forged the signature right? Are we supposed to think Lady Gaga’s character did it? 
3. Why did the police raid Adam Driver’s house? I thought there were no more tax crimes to account for after Al Pacino got arrested? It seemed like Adam escaped to Switzerland to evade arrest, but later he returned and everything was fine, it seemed like nothing came of the police raid. The acting is what kept me watching for sure. I thought the story was kinda meh, and honestly a little boring, and they could have done the first hour in twenty minutes. However, the actors were all so on point that I couldn’t stop watching it. I think Leto the man is a piece of shit, but Leto the actor was tragically hilarious and very well performed. And Pacino, man was it nice to see subtle nuanced Pacino again, like The Godfather days. Driver was good, Gaga made me sick (in a good way). But ya, forgettable Oscar bait somewhat saved by fantastic performances. I have to be honest, when Marizio skied down the hill and saw Paola for the first time, I honestly thought it was Paolo wearing a fake nose and was extremely caught off guard to her being the new love interest. Best part was when Patrizia shows up at Maurizio's house, begging for him to come home. It was a heartbreaking scene but I felt both actors sold it very well. I wish they would have made it more obvious the passage of time, and what years/dates were happening when. For example, we see Aldo celebrating his 70th birthday, then two scenes later he’s celebrating it again, is that the following year? Hard to tell.

Honestly there was a missed opportunity with the use of music - I wish they would have used songs that were reflective of the actual year a scene is taking place in, instead of whatever random pop songs they chose.

I also ultimately don’t think Maurizio was anything more than a hen-pecked husband. Patrizia never had any real power or even fame or public devotion, she was just kind of - there. It seems like in the real life Gucci story, the family would have screwed up their business with or without her involvement. The real point of interest is the murder, which they spent very little time on.

Overall though the movie was entertaining, and everyone put out a great performance. I don’t think it will sweep Oscar gold, but there will probably be some nominations. Lady GaGa gives a convincing look at the depravity of the rich and famous. Scorsese should have directed this movie I really enjoyed this movie. Jared Leto's performance will be very polarizing, but I ate that shit up. My one big complaint is that they didn't show as much of the business side of Gucci as I was yearning for.

But its just a really entertaining movie. Definitely recommend seeing it. Going into this movie blind and then leaving the theater to find out Jared Leto played Paolo is a level of shock I’m not sure I’ll ever experience again I respect Ridley Scott for making the films he wants to make and it seems based off of this year’s sample size that he wants to make films where Adam Driver ***fucks*** I was getting serious Borat vibes from Paolo during the film. “He has my peaches in a very tight greep,” I mean this would sound right at home in a Borat movie. Watched this tonight and loved it. But I'm gonna need some external opinions to help clear up a discussion with my girlfriend.

We can't fully agree on the relationship between Maurizio and Patrizia. We do agree that Patrizia began as a gold digger (Points to her reaction to his name and then stalking him) but we then have varying opinions. 

Did she really fall in love with him? (Points to marrying him despite him having nothing at the time and them being happy without wealth) 

Or did she always see the potential for power and money and she trusted it would come back? (Points to the scenes with Pina and her kickstarting him going back to the Gucci family)

At the end, when she's at his house because of the divorce, was she crying and so on because she loved him or was it because she lost the power and wealth?

PS: Either way, despite her being the ""villain"", I did feel bad for her. What an amazing performance. ",0

I always just pictured him lip-syncing to it and not actually singing along. That was hilarious. Thor decapitating Thanos like 20 minutes into the movie was something I certainly was not expecting to say the least

50," I watched it blind and really enjoyed it. It works as an emotional horror film with some genuinely chilling moments. The mixing of the real world horrors of refugees with the supernatural horror elements was genius. It did seem to follow some cliche-haunted house tropes but I suspect that was on purpose to allow the audience to feel familiar in an unfamiliar narrative.

The sunset scene in the ocean is stunning and the meeting of the witch in the dark was haunting (great voice actor).

Some of the ""ghosts"" had a great design while others did look a bit cheesy.

For the performances alone it's worth a watch (Wunmi Mosaku is great in everything she's in). 

I did speak to a friend who thought it was ""boring"", so I guess you can't please everyone. I thought it was fantastically crafted. The creature/ghost effects were really well done. Some say it wasn't that scary, but it made my wife scream a couple of times, and we watch a LOT of horror movies. I liked everything about this movie except the explicitly horror parts. The first act of the movie and the revelation about their daughter i.e their horrors not being explicitly about what they had seen getting to where they are but also what they had to do to get there was very well done.  

The feeling of isolation within the community and being refugees in modern UK was also very well done and felt very true to life (both good and bad--the kids being xenophobic, the social workers being somewhat cold and distainful but ultimately helpful, the local pub offering help and giving Bol an opportunity to bond with them through singing). 

However, the final act and the impact of the ghosts (or the demon or the witch, I'm unclear of the terminology here but the esoteric nature of it does kind of adds to the spookiness) felt like it wrapped up the movie too neatly with a happily ever after ending. It lost the nuance that had been presented throughout the movie by giving their grief, their guilt, and their past a single entity that they had to overcome to free themselves. Bol says ""Your ghosts follow you. They never leave."" but it feels contradictory to the tone of the movie's end.

That all said, it's a great debut from Remi Weekes and I look forward to seeing more of his voice in future movies, it seems he has a lot to say and the know-how to make some great films hopefully. I loved this movie. I didn’t expect or was able to predict any of the scenes. It captivated me from beginning to end. 

I picked to watch it because it looked different - it broke the mould by casting black actors which grabbed my attention as most horror films have a white cast. I was intrigued when it transpired that the main characters were Sudanese refugees in public housing in a congested, noisy, working-class, urban district in England instead of the horror trope most of us are familiar with - upper-class, white people who silently suffer in a vast, isolated Victorian-style mansion set in a remote, country locality.  As the story developed, I was drawn into it as I wondered and questioned whether there were, in fact, spirits tormenting this couple in this house or if it was all in their head as a result of the trauma they had suffered. 

I thought the film was very clever because it played on a stereotype many have heard or associate with recipients of public housing – that they are ungrateful and undeserving of this largess because they completely destroy the beautiful houses that they have been provided. We see from the reaction of the government officials how most people would view Bol’s act of stripping all the wallpaper off and leaving huge holes in the walls.  Only the audience  was privy to the mental torment that drove Bol to this act with his hammer. It provided us insight into the world of the people who we judge according to our standards from our privileged background.

I think the film is very clever as it managed to skilfully subvert the horror genre by revealing that the horror each of us live with each day in our real world is far scarier, a point made by Rial who reminds Bol that  she is not scared of ghosts after everything she has seen and experienced in her traumatic life. The film has a universal theme that many of us can relate to – so many of us battle with our personal horrors when the choices we have made in the past and their consequences which we live with now fill us with guilt, shame, mental torment and constantly compel us to question whether we are ‘good people’?

I liked the way the film ended by showing that the people who we meet in our lives, though no longer physically with us, never truly leave us because the ghosts of our encounters with them follow us everywhere we go. It wasn't scary in a traditional sense, but the movie did a good job of cultivating a creepy atmosphere and I liked the design of the witch and the ghosts as well as showcasing a bit of African culture.

Really though, the way they used the witch and ghosts to represent survivor's guilt was very effective and well done.  What's sad and scary is that atrocities like those depicted occur every day and people will do what it takes to survive, but not without a psychological and emotional toll.

I don't see myself ever revisiting the movie, but I'm glad I watched it and appreciated the subject matter and execution.  I do think the second act meandered a bit, but I thought the revelation that it wasn't their daughter was done well and that perhaps in the second act it would've been better to show more of their attempts to adapt to their new lives than what we got. One thing that can always be said about horror movies is that they are a representation on cultural fears. I've seen a lot of people complain that the haunted house aspect ""wasn't scary enough"" or it ""relied on loud noises"" and I think that those people missed what made this movie worth a watch.

In the first 15 minutes, I wasn't scared of the ghost, but of what could happen to these two after seeing their asylum seekers status, the disdain for foreigners, and the glimpse of possible PTSD.  I am lucky enough to have never been in that situation, but knowing how real something like this could be is truely terrifying. Very good film! African folklore is very underrepresented in movies “You are a beast, and I am the butcher”


Oddly turned on I really loved Matt Smith's performance in the film. He did a great job showing his characters' contempt for immigrants while maintaining a calm attitude and actually being quite competent in his job of helping the couple.

 I really hope to see him in more antagonistic roles in the future. The whole ""your house is bigger than mine"" line got my blood boiling. Just watched it going in blind and I was very pleasantly surprised, it’s a solid film.  Great acting by both leads.  Good pacing and tension building.  The jump scares were seldom but were effective.  The makeup and horror elements were well done.  There were some beautiful shots in it, especially the slow pan out from the breakfast table to reveal the ocean.

And finally I really enjoyed the fresh perspective on the classic ‘haunted house’ trope... African refugees and African witchcraft/folklore was not something I knew I wanted, but it worked marvelously and I would welcome more of it.

Keeping an eye on this director.  His debut isn’t perfect but it was a great opening. I thought it was a fantastic way to showcase the effects of grief, guilt, and the desire to ""fit in"". Not super scary, but definitely chilling. The story imo is really well done that I honestly dont mind this not having too many scares. I like films that make me tense and that's exactly what the film did. The twist was amazing, acting was amazing. So this was pretty good...

I was hoping Matt Smith would have a larger role.

My original theory on the plot (based solely on the trailer) was that Matt Smith was playing an evil government employee secretly trying to drive out immigrants by poisoning their water supply with hallucinogenic drugs so they appeared crazy...

But the original plot was pretty good too. Kudos all around.

(but what was up with the creepy white neighbor lady? LOL) Very good horror film about survivor's guilt.

But if this were a different film, it could have gone down another perhaps more dangerous rabbit hole.

Namely, what lengths are you willing to go to survive? Is there any point where what you do to survive is immoral? And where is that fine line?

I feel like this film was structured to let Bol off the hook a bit, and give him a nicer send off. And that's fine; its a BBC film, they have their approach and ultimately did a good job. But I'd like to see this same theme explored with different parameters and harder questions asked. I know i'm a bit late.

But i found this movie to be great up until a certain point. Fantastic acting, great setting with the refugees in this weird feeling of isolation, great and creepy horror.



Everything was exceptional untill the hangtitty sackman came out of the ground and it casually gets its throat slit and covered up with a rug like wtf.


Still 90% of the movie was great quality, nothing to complaim about only praise. But the ending had me laughing almost Best film of the year. All the greatest horror films have subtext, there was a lot of it here. Visually great too, the scene when the dead were rising out of the water around him was striking. Also the last scene were you see the divide between the survivors and the people who didn't make it. It's brilliant that shot ended up being the poster for the film, by the end you understand why. I loved it. It felt like a somewhat freshman film but that was refreshing honestly.

I loved the imagery and the ghost. The story of the migrant experience. The surrealism. The maze scene was very tense imo. Watch Spell. It was freaky and pretty good. It's like Misery with voodoo. This movie gave me the chills and also the feels. Definitely not a ‘scary’ movie by any means, but really effective use of horror elements to illustrate  the trauma/survivors guilt/ isolation etc. that asylum seekers can experience. Best horror I’ve seen since Midsommar and The House That Jack Built! I love how emotional and real this got, and it works as both a ghost story (backed by folklore) and a drama about survivors guilt. Very moving, and fucking scary at parts! The witch during the dream scene is so memorable. Incoming nightmares. Come to /r/horror for more discussion  about it! This movie is by far my favourite horror of 2020 I loved it, I have a question tho, how did Rial not know Nyagak was not her daughter? She asks the night witch to see her daughter, how does she not know she's not her daughter? Watched this tonight. Sure, might have been slightly cliché with some of the haunted house tropes, but that is a very very minor criticism- mixing it with the immigrant/refugee experience, as well as African witchcraft, super unique. Loved it. ",0

Can we just take a moment to praise KG in this film? He had more screen time than Lakeith Stanfield! I loved how Idina Menzel's character knew about all of Howard's antics from the get-go and we didn't have to see a drawn out breakdown of their marriage. y'all we just saw Adam Sandler fight The Weekend one of my favorite moments is when Howie is on the phone with his doctor and he says something like “Colon Cancer has cost me a lot of family” and the doctor says “Well colon cancer bought me a house in the Hampton’s” 

There were quite a few good one liners here It hit me on the way home, right after they do the deed at the end and are smashing and stealing everything, the door is still missing the file. They can't get out of the jewelry shop without the door being fixed and they just shot the guy that fixed it before (where two others failed). Also, his wife was freaking out (about the trunk thing and weird phone call from earlier) and was about to call the cops. They didn't show you what happened, but they gave you everything you needed in the last few seconds to figure it out. Kevin Garnett should seriously act more ""I THOUGHT WE WERE THE CHOSEN PEOPLE"" is prob my favorite line of the year. I think this movie is secretly space jam 2 I want someone to want me as much as KG wanted the opal. This movie is a perfect example of how to build tension throughout a movie. 

From the moment Howard is introduced, we see how tight of a rope he is walking. I don’t know how Sandler did it, but he elevated and already amazing story. The pace is so tight and the camera is right up in the actors face that you get everything. I want to know how the duck they filmed the kidnapping in the car. 

Kevin Garnett was surprisingly really good. I mean, it’s not like an amazing performance, and I don’t know basketball or Garnett personally, but he really pulled it off, along with all the other actors. 

This movie ties with the Lighthouse and Knives Out as my movie of the year. The whole movie definitely had this steady, building tension, but the scene where KG comes back with the Opal and they can’t get the door open while the phones are ringing and the camera is just panning around the jewelry shop really stepped on the gas. It felt like the movie didn’t let up from there, and when it finally was over I felt like I could finally breathe again.

*edit* the fact that Howard’s tag was sticking out of his sweater the whole time was driving me CRAZY The moment he went and immediately pawned Garnett's ring nearly gave me an anxiety attack and that feeling didn't stop the whole movie. This shit was bananas and the ending left me speechless. Don't know if it's been mentioned much but the auction house lady on the phone is Tilda Swinton. And KG's manager, who he threatens to sue, is Natasha Lyonne. I loved how Arno from the trailers seemed like your run-of-the-mill pissed off gangster, but that wasn’t the case at all. 

I was blown away when it's revealed he's Howard's Brother-In-Law and you can tell throughout the whole movie he kinda cares about him and took Howard's negligence to heart. It makes it more tragic on how he fucked up hiring those goons to scare Howard which eventually led to both of their deaths. [deleted] I really think Julia was the only character who actually loved Howard. She constantly defied my expectations, I figured she would be shoehorned into the gold-digger role. In a movie that depicts the corruption of wealth and the suffering that comes with it, she was a diamond in the rough ;) It seemed as Howard lived a pretty luxurious lifestyle between the big house in the suburbs, the apartment in the city, the Mercedes Benz and all the fancy jewelry he had. You would think that $100k isn’t really that big of a hole for someone like him. He could just sell off some assets and pay that off. He went through ALOT for only $100k including it costing him his own life I NEVER RESURFACED ANYTHING! Ah yes, my favourite psychedelic colonoscopy Was not expecting that ending but, looking back on it, that was the only way out for our boy Howard That final 20 minutes had me feeling like i had placed the bet on the celtics. Everytime KG scored i cheered.

Masterclass film-making right there. Throughout the entire movie, I kept telling myself no way this has a happy ending. Then when he wins the bet, I was like how about that! Spoke too soon.. 

What a movie. Intense from start to finish. The ending was super effective and the perfect conclusion. Also an amazing way to utilize real past events for anyone who already knew the outcome of Sandler's bet.

Reminded me a lot of 1974's ""The Gambler"" starring James Caan. Similar fitting ending for a difficult to like protagonist. This whole movie really impressed me, but the scene that I fell head over heels in love with was the ending when Sandler has the goons trapped in the glass box. That’s really clever writing. The fact that he’s got these people imprisoned but the threat is still squarely on him is a remarkable twist of tension and subversion of the typical rules of conflict. I had a smile on my face the whole time and really felt like I was witnessing some brilliant cinematic storytelling. ",0
121," Anyone else watch the whole “Truth or Dare” scene through the cracks of their fingers? Seriously couldn’t stop squirming until the lights to her front porch turned on I teared up when Kayla asked her dad if he was sad to have her as his daughter. I definitely remember feeling like that as a kid, so for her to put the notion out there and for him to reassure her that he makes her so *so* happy was very cathartic for me. kayla: i feel like if i had a daughter that turned out like me she’d make me sad

me: stop the ride im gonna die Ironically the Truth or Dare scene in this movie was more terrifying than the entirety of the actual horror film called *Truth or Dare* The dinner date with Gabe was so hilariously wholesome, which felt needed after that truth or dare scene. I really want to know where they found that kid. 

""You know what would go great with this? Szechuan sauce.""  It's nice to see such a positive portrayal of a single dad As a former 8th grade band geek, that national anthem was the hardest I've laughed in a theater in a long time. Fucking perfect recreation of how bad a junior band sounds. I loved it.  *takes bite of chicken tender*

""Do you believe in God?"" Whats funny is that even if the memes weren't relevant  now, because its middle schoolers, it still workd  A lot of people mention how this really captures middle school, and all I could think while I was sobbing in theaters was how much her social isolation and anxiety reminds me of my life now -- and I'm in my late twenties.  I keep thinking I'll escape that intense loneliness and awkwardness one day, but I haven't yet. It's just repeat ad nauseum in every situation. That kid she goes on a date with at the end is 100% a redditor. One of the more heartbreaking moments in this film for me was after the scene where Riley tried to take advantage of her and she tells him ""Don't tell Olivia about this."" She thinks Olivia would find her less cool because she ""chickened out of"" ""doing stuff"" with a boy for the first time, when in reality Kayla trusted her gut, and did the right thing. Plus Olivia would have kicked that dude's ass for what he did. Olivia was the absolute best person to tell about it, and it was in Riley's best interest for her not to find out. Just devastating. So glad the high school friend didn’t turn bitch! Nice to see a cute girl portrayed as nice in a movie.  Man, this movie has some uncomfortable moments. Outside of the obvious moments (the car scene), Kayla being mean to her dad who’s just trying to support her made me really sad and, based on my own dad, worried that he was going to snap on her. But this wasn’t that kind of movie. The dad was just a super nice guy who wanted the best for his daughter. I loved that. I smiled so damn hard during the graduation scene when it looks like Kayla is about to go running after the boy in the hallway but instead goes to confront those bitchy girls  The scene where she prayed to God and just asked for the next day to be good even if the other days will be bad. I wanted to cry. I’ve done that so much as a kid, I didn’t think i’d ever see that on screen. Also, when she told her dad if he feels sad having a daughter like her...the amount of times I have said that to my mom isn’t unreal. I love that a movie finally captured all of this.  ""I can't wait to be you"" had me tearing up bad The scene with Kayla's dad while they're burning her time capsule made me cry. I wish someone had said anything like her dad's monologue to me at that age.  I really liked how her dad gave Kayla the advice to ""put herself out there"", and she initially blows it off like all teenagers. However, her next video is about putting yourself out there. I really liked that. It was an effective way of showing her dad's impact on Kayla and how she does take what he says seriously.  Gabe is my new favorite character in any movie ever... maybe because I know I was the EXACT SAME. Thank you Bo for making me confront my past self arguably TOO much The banana scene was my favorite. The whole theater was screaming.  There's been a lot of talk about how accurately the film portrays that age and modern teenage life, but I haven't heard anyone talk about what I believe to be the actual theme of the movie. Even more than awkwardness, I believe what Burnham is trying to convey is empathy. 

I'm not a girl in her early teens; I don't even *know* any girls in their early teens. Still, this movie made me really care for Kayla and her problems in a way that most movies don't. Suspension of disbelief lets us identify with the protagonist, but usually this is in service to the plot. In Eighth Grade, the plot itself seems to be a vehicle to bring us closer to Kayla. It's also emphasized several times that one of Kayla's strengths is her empathy for the people around her, and we see this play out in her interactions with Gabe (the nerdy boy) and even Riley in the mall. Furthermore, it's usually the other character's *lack* of empathy that makes them ""villainous"": the boys seeing Kayla only as a sex object and the popular girls not seeing her at all (literally). Olivia is cool not because she's popular but because she reaches out to Kayla, sees what she's going through and tries to help.

I believe what Bo is trying to do is instill a sense of empathy in us, the audience. And I *think* the intent is for it not just to be for Kayla during the movie, but hopefully to train us to be more empathetic in our own lives. I have to admit I'm biased in favor of that effort myself, so I may be reading too much into it there, but it wouldn't be that far out of line with other things Bo has done. His works often have a moral of sorts. And certainly Eighth Grade has made me want to care more about other people even if their problems are different than mine. I hope Elsie Fisher at least gets awards buzz for this. One of the smallest, but so real, details was that little ""blah"" noise she makes when she stumbles on or mispronounces a word in her videos. Growing up, I remember so many people nervously doing that when speaking in front of the class room. She brought that character to life. It will be a damn shame if this doesn't get attention at the Oscars. I will be very surprised if I love another movie more this year. Is no one going to mention the dabbing principal? 😂 ",0
91," That whole movie was a trip.... but the Bennie and the Jets number was on a whole different level. I LOVED THIS SO MUCH!

Taron Egerton is amazing as Elton John.  His singing is incredible.  The film isn't afraid to show the darker parts of Elton's life.  The song performances are fantastical and dreamlike. 

It's everything I wanted Bohemian Rhapsody to be. I think what separates Rocketman from Bohemian Rhapsody is that Elton is still here to tell his story. 

I loved how authentic it felt, how Elton was not the hero the whole story and he was incredibly honest about his life. He said before the movie premiered that he wouldn’t tone down the sex and drugs and I think the film would have suffered greatly if it had. The drugs were not glorified and they were not shown in a positive life. 

Overall, I rated this my top movie of the year and I hope it wins all the awards next year. 9.5/10 ""He still has a problem with shopping"" might be the best freeze-frame/""where are they now"" text in any biopic ever I wonder what John Reid was like in real life. In both this and bohemian rhapsody he is just a super douche. Anyone else impressed by how meaningful and relevant to people’s lives the messages they tried to convey in this movie were? It was actually a good film about mental health and self-examination. I think people can relate to Elton a lot and I hope it convinces some to seek therapy, I like how it showed it was one of the best things to ever happen to him. “Guy next to me wouldn’t stop crying” 

- girl next to me during whole Elton John movie What a pleasant surprise when Jamie Bell belted out ‘Goodbye Yellow Brick Road’. Astonishing sequence and so thematically rich.

Fletcher and Egerton did some amazing work in following the biographical structure but adding so much whimsy and darkness through those musical sequences. Everyone will likely talk about the ""Crocodile Rock"" scene but the ""Your Song"" scene was beautiful asf. Favorite Elton song. I get the feeling the approach this film takes is something you're either on board with, or you're not.  
  
I absolutely loved it. Not really an Elton John fan (don't get me wrong, like the songs I've heard just never listened to that much) but I was absolutely on board for the ride. It gave a jolt in the arm to the tired music-biopic format. The fantasy elements were used to great effect. Take the scene where everyone levitates during his first performance. It shows the effect he had much more than just a straight song performance could. It really helped to show us who Elton is, more than just re-enactments of things he did.  
  
To repeat everyone else, Taron is fantastic. Really helps to let the actor actually sing rather than mime, it frees him up so much. Jamie Bell is as great as ever. Richard Madden, Bryce Dallas Howard, Steven Graham. Loved the cast.  
  
It does however further denigrate Bohemian Rhapsody in my eyes. Can you even imagine how amazing a Queen film would've been if they'd had the balls (figurative and literal) that this film had? If they just went for it, rather than having band members accidentally come up with classic songs that Rami Malek then mimes. The extremes this film goes to only serves to further show how safe Bo Rhap played it. It's such a wasted opportunity.  
  
But blessed are we, for Rocketman was not such a waste. Do yourself a favour. And try not to get out of your seat and start dancing during the Saturday Night's Alright scene. Egerton...wow. Dude totally killed it. Sure as shit didn’t think he had something like that in him. Movies that end too soon.

Wow, I loved the movie. I could have happiely watched another 2 hours.

I would have loved to see more. The love story with his partner, the Lion King, Princes Di. So much more story to tell. 

Campy fun, heartfelt storytelling: More please! I'm not gay but damn do I like Richard Madden's accent Taron was really good in this. And what a great pick: there were a few shots when he was in full stage costume where I could have sworn they snuck the real Elton in. [deleted] I liked how every time we cut back to the support group, Elton had another piece of his outfit removed until he was normally dressed like everyone else in there. Thought that was a neat touch. The fact that his big showdown with the people who caused him pain in life was him facing them down as figments of his imagination was surprisingly moving, and I think it better reflects the real man than if he went and talked to all of the people in person. The moment where he hugged his younger self was quick but incredibly effective. The big resolution wasn’t him showing his demons who was boss, but learning to love himself. It was incredibly moving. Just about every person near me in the theatre was crying, including myself. I heard constant rumbling in the background throughout the movie and I couldn’t tell if it was from the thunderstorm outside or Godzilla in the IMAX theater down the hall I was kind of waiting for the movie to really start for a while, but as soon as the “Saturday Night” scene started, holy shit I was hooked. This 100% becomes a Broadway musical. And I'll be first in line to see it. The scene where his boyhood version asks Elton ""when are you going to hug me?"" was honestly one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen. Liked the movie but loved this. 

So many people in life could benefit from embracing the hardships of their childhood and showing themselves love. It spoke to me. One of my favorite parts of this movie was how ""gay-positive"" it was. Bohemian Rhapsody really didn't portray Freddie's sexuality in a great light: his first encounter with a man is in a seedy truck stop, his hetero love interest was his final saving grace, etc. It really made it seem like everything bad in Freddie_s life was due to his being gay. 

Rocketman really shows it differently. The sex scenes aren't shown as morally corrupt, but rather the same as any sexual relationship anyone has. His issues come from his decadent and self-destructive lifestyle, and his sexuality isn't the root cause of that. Strange how Taron Egerton has covered ""I'm Still Standing"" 2 times for 2 different movies This movie. THIS FUCKING MOVIE. 

It was perfect. I know is not a perfect movie, but with my bias I’m gonna give it a perfect 10/10. This is how you do a jukebox musical. Some highlights:

1. Rocketman, man this number was awesome. I love the transition from the pool to the hospital to the baseball outfit. Easily one of the best performance of the movie.

2. When Elton is practicing his smile and then goes out and starts playing the piano, and the scene is just spinning. I love how the mark his downward spiral. Perfectly done. 

3. When young Elton started signing Saturday Night’s Alright (for fighting). At first I thought, “man, they must be crazy to waste this song like this” but soon enough Taron Elton appeared and it was so well done. 

4. When Sorry seems to be the hardest word stars palming in the background in that breakfast with his wife, and then continues through the dinner with his mom and Bernie. 

5. Like how he started rehab with the devil’s outfit, and little by little Elton gets undressed to, show us the passage of time, and that he’s becoming more vulnerable. 

6. Speaking of rehab. I like how the final confrontation with all of his demons were done in front of the other people in rehab, and they didn’t fade to the background just leaving Elton and the people he needed to confront. It probably wasn’t the intention of the scene, but I took it as his life not being really private, he is a public figure, after all. I said this in the advanced screening thread and I need to say it again. I feel the biggest reason I liked this movie was that they never showed drugs and alcohol wasn’t cool about it. You saw him struggling and the part that hit me the most was when he was having breakfast and he fills half his cup with vodka and the rest with oj and you see the look on his wife’s face and it really feels like he know his life is a mess. It really showed with what he has has been fighting for and his causes. I feel he was really trying to let people know not to end up like him and get help. I also loved the end where they ended with I’m still standing it was perfect. ",0
64," I really enjoyed the movie, the first part of the movie felt like typical romcom, predictable but very comforting. And the second part, especially when the sisters argued, it felt really heavy and cathartic in a positive way.

The redemption part felt little bit rushed for me and I kinda wished Riley (Aubrey Plaza) arc got resolved. That being said I really like the chemistry of between her and Kristen Stewart, it was really charming. Also, I think Mackenzie Davies and Kristen Stewart chemistry was pretty good, especially in the beginning of the movie.

In the end, pretty refreshing romcom and I think Kristen Stewart should be in more romance and comedy movies.


Side Note: 

* I saw [this photo](https://www.metroweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Happiest-Season-Photo-by-Lacey-Terrell-1.jpg) few months ago, and it showed up again on Tipper's instagram I assume that Riley is seeing someone new and Clea Duvall is portrayed her.

* I also like that Jane (Mary Holland) and John (Dan Levy) became BFF. I really enjoyed this movie. Great cast (including smaller cameo parts), and a lot of very funny moments mixed into a cute feel good story. Wanted to get that out of the way so that my minor complaints don’t come off as too negative. However...

I *hated* that Harper repeatedly left Abby alone at parties where she didn’t know anyone, or sent on outings with family members she’d just met, or ditched her to stay out late at a bar with her old friends. It made me so uncomfortable. Separately and independently from everything about her family issues and closetedness, she was just an inattentive partner and bad friend to Abby, who she’d brought into this very awkward and uncomfortable situation in the first place. I feel like they spent too much screen time showing her being a bad partner to strain their relationship and not enough showing why they were good together in a relationship to begin with. 

Also, Jane was very clearly the best member of that family from the start. The most heartbreaking moment wasn’t about any of the romantic or family relationships, it was when Jane’s absolutely beautiful painting got destroyed. And the most gratifying (albeit heavily telegraphed) moment was after the time jump when her novel was a bestseller. Dan Levy’s scene about coming out to your family was such an emotional scene. He stole any scene he was in. I just read [this article](https://www.indiewire.com/2020/11/happiest-season-clea-duvall-queer-rom-com-1234599465/)

> Late in the film, Harper’s sexuality is unmasked — without her consent — to her entire family, the kind of big revelation scene that has populated many a rom-com, but “Happiest Season” gives it a painful twist. Harper doesn’t use the moment to finally come out, but to pull herself deeper into the closet. It’s heartbreaking for Abby, and the kind of disruption to genre expectations that makes the film so special.
> 
> “We all have our baggage, we all have our main triggers and our fight or flight responses, and I think Harper is someone who was like operating in this certain way for a long time,” DuVall said. “It’s this devastating moment where your instincts kick in and you realize that you have not come as far as you thought you have, because you haven’t really confronted yourself. It’s a very humbling moment and something that I think we can all relate to, no matter what it is we’re overcoming. You don’t overcome it on the first try.”

Yeah, this made me understand that reveal your queerness is not as easy as you think, especially when you can't predict their reaction

> As Abby flees from the scene, it’s John who catches up with her. Instead of tossing off some sassy witticisms, Levy’s character instead offers an emotional and introspective assessment of the situation, one that leans heavily on some necessary empathy.
> 
> “I wrote this speech about coming out, because I was thinking about how we can have compassion for Harper in that moment,” DuVall said. “She does do something that is pretty bad and I can see why an audience would be upset with her, but it’s also about wanting to have compassion for people who are going through that. Coming out is so different for everybody. For some people, it’s super easy and I think that’s great for them, but for a lot of people, it’s really not.”

Yeah, glad that she gave Dan Levy (John) one of the most gut-punching moment in the movie, he really delivered on that. I think I’m too used to seeing Plaza in an evil/crazy role...I fully expected her to tell everyone they were lesbians. Glad she didn’t. I wish there was more of her in this film. 

Also 

“Did you celebrate Christmas at the orphanage?” Yo... the closet is rough, I get that. But the closet doesn't make you ignore your girlfriend, spend all night with an ex, and then call her ""smothering"" when she calls you on it. The hell was this movie

Like, it sets up the premise like it's gonna be a lot of wacky misunderstandings, but all the conflicts and misunderstandings are not even remotely played like they're supposed to be funny. Weirdly dark movie, just weird all around. The movie suffered from making Harper too evil and the parents too nice. We're constantly told how horrible the dad is and I just didn't see it. He's not depicted as a good person, but if you want to justify Harper's awfulness, you needed to make the parents worse.  Also you can't have Harper be the favorite child, I feel like Harper's behavior would have been slightly more justifiable if the parents kept fawning over Allison Brie and ignoring Harper. 

I'm not the first person to say this, but this needed to be a braver movie where Harper and Abby just break up. A lot of Harper being a bad partner had little to do with her parents. Leaving Abby at all the parties, being jealous and hypocritical, etc.  

If you have to end this movie with Harper and Abby together, cut out some moments of Harper being cruel to Abby, change the whole beginning to flesh out Harper and Abby and show why they are together, and have Allison Brie be the favorite child and not Harper. I really want to see the movie Kristen Stewart and Aubrey Plaza thought they were making I think the biggest problem is they didn't do enough to get people invested in Abby and Harper's relationship. All they get you to do is like Abby (you know, she doesn't like Christmas but is willing to put that aside, shes gonna propose) but then you spend over an hour watching her get dumped on by a never ending parade of shitty, toxic assholes. So you could give a rat's ass about them fixing their relationship, you'd rather just see Abby get the hell out of there. Then they rushed into trying to tie a little bow into redeeming this crappy family before it felt earned.

I spent the entire back half of the movie hoping Kristen Stewart and Aubrey Plaza would run off together. Let them bond over what an asshole Harper is.

(But I liked Dan Levy) Personally wanted Abbey to get with Riley. Hated Harper and she didn't do enough to redeem her behaviour imo. Thought that family was terrible and felt so sorry for Jane. I'm so glad her book got published. “I have a way with routers” Overall I really enjoyed it but where they lost me was at the very end. There was so much toxic build up, Abby was hurt so much. If they wanted Abby and Harper to stay together, they should have at least did a small time jump...something like— Abby does leave and goes home. Stays with a friend and she runs back into Harper on NYE..

We see Harper working things out with her parents before then and really digesting her behavior and how she fucked up. Then they agree to try again and we see them all happy and together again next Christmas. 

I did still feel for Harper, coming out can be so incredibly scary and painful as Levy’s character so aptly pointed out. But Harper needed some time to work on it instead of them just going “Oh cool, poof it’s all better now”. Thoughtful/constructive commentary aside, I just really liked the height difference between Kristen Stewart and Mackenzie Davis. Either Kristen is tinier than I've realised, or Mackenzie is basically an Amazon. I wonder if anyone (while filming) brought up the fact that they made Harper almost too unlikable in this. 

They kind of kept piling on reasons for people to dislike her. I can see why everyone was rooting for the Abby/Riley pairing, simply because Abby was consistently being hosed by the writers throughout the movie. This movie had the chance to be great and it blew it. It needed to make the bold move and it settled for the sappy ending instead.

Abbey deserved so much better and Harper was legit awful. I know it’s about her struggle feeling like she has to choose between her family or her girlfriend, but that’s just like... I don’t know.

Abbey should’ve ended up going home with John and starting over completely or she should have gotten with Riley. Harpers parents were straight up shitty people with no redeeming qualities and them suddenly being ok with everything at the end was absurd and also makes Harpers feeling extremely stupid, Harper was a selfish asshole too, she constantly treated Abby like shit and was completely oblivious to how her parents were treating her. Doesn’t matter if she’s terrified of her parents disowning her. Fuck them anyway they were extremely toxic and writhe with mental abuse. There's something about Christmas movies having the worst families, they were all terrible to each other. I loved the supporting cast and mostly had fun, but I think everyone in the family ended up a bit too unlikeable. Overall, not an awful way to spend a lazy Friday and better than a lot of the Christmas romcom garbage out there. This is one of the better Christmas movies in awhile in my opinion. Side note: is it bad that I wanted Kristen Stewart and Aubrey Plazas characters to get together instead? Can we get a sequel around the best characters, John (Dan Levy) Riley (Aubrey Plaza) and Jane (Mary Holland), the latter of whom deserved SO MUCH better? They can all wingman/wingwoman each other. 

Like it can be around Harper and Abby hosting Christmas or having a Christmas wedding, whatever. I liked it. And I feel like a lot of folks in this comment section are falling prey to that most Reddit of behaviours, looking at one bad time and suggesting someone throw their entire relationship out.

The opening picture montage tells us that Abby and Harper have been together, and happy, for over a year; Abby moved in six months ago, and things have gone so well she's planning to propose. Aside from a bit of awkwardness on their date, every indication is that this is a happy, functional couple. 

And then they visit Harper's family. After just a couple of days of being closeted and surrounded by toxic people Abby wants to get out of there, and who can blame her? These people suck! She's not at all wrong to leave that party, or to tell Harper it's over at that point. But Abby's feeling punchy and angry and off-balance after just a few days of hiding herself around strangers; why are we surprised that Harper is an even worse mess when she's doing it with her family? Of course she's acting shitty, look at the environment she was raised in! When she's in the city with Abby and John she can be her actual self, but in her parents house she reverts to being the paranoid closeted lying teenage trainwreck she was.

And if she'd stayed that way, Abby would've been entirely right to walk away and never look back. But, and this is the important part, Harper doesn't stay that way; she recognizes that she's been shitty to Abby, she admits her mistakes and apologizes and promises to do better. And as we see literally the next day, when she's openly cuddling with Abby on the couch, and when Abby is invited into the family picture, there is change and their is improvement. And if someone is working to change, is it really so wrong to give them another chance?

I liked Happiest Season because it does what romcoms so rarely do; show a couple actually working through a problem and coming out the other side. 

Also, because Dan Levy. But who doesn't like Dan Levy? Jane stole every scene. Which is impressive when she’s the only actress I hadn’t seen anything of beforehand. Harper failing to save Abby from falling off the roof was basically a spoiler for how the rest of the movie would go. Consistently failing her girlfriend in like every department lol, really wish they went for a bold ending where they broke up. I was really happy when Kristen Stewart's character walked out and her girlfriend thought everything would be better when she told everyone.

I kind of wish they ended on that. I know it wouldn't be very christmassy, but I feel like rom coms should end that way sometimes. first of all can i just point out how GOOD kristen looked during the white elephant party. like the half buttoned shirt and eye makeup and hair and everything holy crap she shouldve left harper to date ME!

yeah anyways i loved abby john and jane but harper? ew no gross!

sloane did not need to be redeemed shes an asshole who outed her own sister outta jealousy..

harper also did not need to be redeemed at all. shes terrible, toxic, manipulative, mean, a hypocrite and bitchy. like yeah being closeted is hard but thats no excuse?! for being a terrible gf??!

honestly i really hoped abby would’ve left harper for riley. they have wayyyy more chemistry! also john and janes friendship is everything i love them so much

overall funny movie but the ending was super unrealistic so 6/10 Harper was unlikeable for 80% of this film lol ",0
13," I enjoyed it, but I would have appreciated more discussion about the music and its creation in the studio.  It seemed to focus heavily on the culture that surrounded them, which is fine and intersting, but not enough on the actual music. It felt more like a John Cale and Lou Reed biographical documentary, rather than a music documentary.  It took too long to get to the creation of the VU, and not enough time on the demise of the VU, which felt like a small paragraph in this novel of a documentary.  

Still, I'm glad it was made. The Jonathan Richman interviews were fantastic.  I could watch a whole documentary of just him talking about the Velvet Underground. I recommend Owen Gleiberman's review, which I agree with 100%: [https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/the-velvet-underground-review-todd-haynes-john-cale-lou-reed-1235013500/](https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/the-velvet-underground-review-todd-haynes-john-cale-lou-reed-1235013500/)

As a casual (far from hardcore) fan, I was quite disappointed in the coverage. Would have liked to see much more on the post-Cale albums (especially the 1969 self-titled) and on the reunion. Doug Yule is once again completely memory holed. So unfair given that he was nothing but a professional and had a major part to play in two excellent albums that have a place in music history. No mention at all of the Velvets' significance in Eastern Europe: [https://www.kcrw.com/music/articles/how-the-velvet-underground-influenced-the-velvet-revolution](https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/the-velvet-underground-review-todd-haynes-john-cale-lou-reed-1235013500/) and how that played into how they were received in the 90s right after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Very little screen time for Moe Tucker. No Laurie Anderson (she must have refused to participate but her absence is glaring). Reed's sexuality is treated awkwardly, almost with embarrassment. Not even a nod to Candy's trans identity in ""Candy Says."" I could go on.

There were some really moving and interesting parts, especially about Cale and Reed's childhoods, reactions from audiences while on tour, East and West Coast rock rivalry, Nico's aspirations, and so on. The visual style is effective, suits a prestige doc - but it's too niche and experimental as an intro to the band and too cursory for fans. It should have been a two-parter for streaming like last year's Laurel Canyon rather than trying to cram everything into a 2-hour theatrical feature. I'm about to watch it. Just so you know, the podcast No Dogs In Space just started a series on TVU. Episode one was great, and the podcast is always a great balance of fun, and in-depth research. Saw it in the Big Screen at London Film Festival. The music sounded incredible on a massive sound system. Didn't really care for it.

The first hour or so was boring, I wanted to watch a documentary on The Velvet Underground, not whatever that was.

When they finally get into the music part, everything gets glossed over.

A quick look at their Wikipedia and it says that the drummer soent the 80's working at Walmart which seems insane. It's technically well made... but it's reverent to a fault. I kept getting reminded of how Bohemian Rhapsody felt because it alluded to many things but was more interested in being stylish than it was substantial. I would've preferred a slightly more objective approach. I love The Velvet Underground & Nico, one of the best albums ever Will watch it next week in theater. Will come back here If only it was on anything but Apple TV :( I agree, it was a 2 hour documentary, but it seemed to dwell a lot on the tangential stuff, and not so much on the music. It was still good, but not so much a documentary about the band, more a film surrounding the scene that birthed them. The interviews were cool though. I have to say I wholeheartedly disagree. If you want to know that side of the story there’s a thousand Uncut and Mojo articles about ‘the creation of The Velvet Underground and Nico’. Haynes does an exceptional job of visually telling the story of New York in the 60’s/the whole Warhol art scene without the film ever feeling didactic or like you’re just watching someone (who is usually tangential to the scene) tell you what happened. Jonathan is the only person who can play the role of the ‘talking head’ and is fucking awesome. Great music film, I’d actually say the best right next to Don’t Look Back. I strongly agree with this,wish there was more in the doc about Angus MacLise and his time in the band Not a bad review, but the guy says HATES their second album. What the absolute fuck? I can't really take him seriously after that. Todd Haynes made a commitment that he would include only people who were contemporaries to the Velvets. Doug Yule was invited to participate but refused. Laurie Anderson who met Lou several decades later, has nothing to do with the VU. I would say I am a fan of TVU, but not a diehard, and really enjoyed No Dogs Left In Space covering the Velvet Underground for I think 5 podcast episodes.  I went into this doc expecting a compressed version of that story, with talking heads, actual music, and whatever footage may still exist from that time period. 

What I got was a seemingly meandering first third/half, then onto a bit of the first few albums, a quick gloss over the collapse of the band, Andy's dead, here's the credits.  

I wanted something with more substance.  Dive into Lou Reed's post VU career for 2 minutes, touch on how Mo turned political decades later, talk about how Songs for Drella could have been a true reunion album, there's so much out there, but what we got was mostly smoke. Thanks, I'll have to give that a listen! Oh I missed that - guess I don’t agree 100%! Yeah, with a week's worth of hindsight I can understand his choices better and appreciate the film for what it is. But in the moment I was left unsatisfied and I still probably won't revisit or recommend it. ",0
72," “Even though I am 64 and have a dead gay husband, I manage to get up every day, live my life and feel pretty good about myself!”

god bless julie hagerty Something that I found somewhat heartbreaking towards the end was the fact that Grandma wasn't calling him ""Charlie Bird"" anymore and didn't hug him the same way, she was just playing with the other guy. So do you watch married couples often?

No, why would I-

I was kidding. Driver is (rightfully so) getting a lot of praise for that argument scene, but I think that the part where he breaks down during the sidebar with Alda is equally heartbreaking. I can’t believe he didn’t think to put a picture frame over the hole in the wall. I’m not sure why, but for me the most devastating moment was Charlie walking in on the mom being goofy with the new boyfriend. It feels like the whole movie is leading up to Charlie reading what Nicole has written for him. Such an emotional gut-punch. Maybe if they had opened up to each other in the beginning and communicated what they really felt in a clear and concise manner, the divorce could've been prevented. 

Also, another thing that I love about the movie, so much set-ups and payoffs. The knife, Henry's struggle to read (And the excellent emotional payoff of him reading the letter with his dad at the end), Nicole having to cut her family's hair and how shaggy Charlie looked during the separation. Wonderful writing. One of the best movies of 2019. Never would have thought I'd hear the voice of rex from toy story say ""four time oscar winner sucking my dick!"" But here we are. Adam Driver buying like 20 houseplants for his flat is like the most accurate break up behaviour I've ever seen Movie should be called:

Three Lawyers Divvy Up a MacArthur Grant When Charlie tells Nicole in the end that he’s taking a residency at UCLA, there’s such a nuanced and incredibly powerful moment where Nicole just wonders, “Then why did we go through all this”? I fucking love this film. As a lawyer, this might be the most accurate legal movie I have ever seen. It nails how insane the process is to clients who have not navigated it before and how the lawyers are so divorced from the humanity of their clients and who they are opposing.

EDIT: Even little stuff, like the tactic (which they did on Big Little Lies too this season) of meeting with lawyers to conflict them out of representing the other side.

It's little but that scene of the lawyers chummily ordering lunch while Charlie and Nicole stare on with dead eyes was amazing. This movie cemented Adam Driver as next level actor. Holy shit, the argument scene was intense, the end where he reads the note and starts quivering - wild. This must have been a rough watch for Jennifer Jason Leigh. It has to be so weird to have your ex make a movie about your divorce. Anyone else need to take a deep breath after the argument scene in Charlie’s apartment? Some of the greatest acting I’ve ever seen One thing I noticed was that their Halloween costumes represented how they felt at that point in their lives. He was the invisible man, unseen and sort of lost. She was David Bowie, a rock star, living her best life.

Same thing in the end, he was a ghost and she was one of The Beatles. Glad to see Ray Liotta rocking again. The fight in the apartment felt like when you see your parents screaming at each other and you desperately want them to stop fighting. It was one of the most heartbreaking scenes I've seen in any movie, which got even more devastating when Charlie collapsed on his knees and Nicole held him. Easily the career-best performances from Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson.

Also, I had no idea Adam Driver could sing so when he belted out ""Being Alive"" I was stunned. You could feel how cathartic the song was to Charlie Between this and Jojo Rabbit, it’s a really big year for Scarlett Johansson tying shoelaces. The moment when they're closing the gate, tiny but powerful. ""Nora's great I feel like we could be friends with her.""

""Why do I feel like that won't happen?!"" It’s a close battle between Adam Driver and Joaquin Phoenix this year. I don’t mean for the Oscar, but for who had the better scene helping a frightened person open an apartment door with bloodied hands. Loved the ongoing commentary on LA and space I caught this in theaters a couple weeks ago, and it’s my favorite film of the year. Funny, devastating, sweet...

One thing that really worked for me was Randy Newman’s score; it has a very similar feel to his Pixar music (though totally works for this film on its own). As a 26 year old, Newman’s *Toy Story*/*Bug’s Life*/*Monster’s Inc.* scores were the soundtrack of my childhood before getting into the works of people like John Williams or Hans Zimmer.

Hearing the playful, deeply heartfelt sounds of Newman’s music throughout this film lent it an extra emotional layer that helps it play as both very sweet and incredibly heartbreaking (like the best of Pixar). It’s a weird thing to have such a grown up film feel like an extension of my childhood.

On a similar note: the opening sequence of Charlie and Nicole listing what they love about one another was one of the most emotionally engaging film openings I’ve experienced since *Up*. What I loved most about this film is that you could understand why she needed to divorce him also understand why the divorce was unfairly hard in him. I think Baumbach was very successful in his desire to show that ""to take sides is folly"" ",1
16," The bagpipes. THE BAGPIPES Anyone else feel like the importance of water was a miss? I was especially disappointed that they cut Paul crying after killing Janis. I always felt that his giving of his bodies water at the death of Janis and honoring him in that way, in the eyes of the Fremen, was a significant contributor to their initial acceptance of him. 

I had a giant ass grin on my face when Kyne brought out the hooks. I wish I had a recording of my face going from ecstatic to horrified when she died; what a great tease. 

I was really disappointed the dinner scene didn't make it in but also understand how hard a scene like that would be to convert to film. 

Ultimately I thought it was an incredible adaptation of a book that I always thought would be impossible to convert to visual media correctly. The visuals were stunning. Especially the space-faring vessels. Fucking awesome. It turns out I've been mispronouncing pretty much everything from the Dune universe Felt like Skarsgard used Brando in Apocalypses Now as inspiration. Some of the shots and mannerisms felt the same I just watched it on IMAX. I was bummed out not because the film was bad, but because I didn’t want the film to end and it did. I became deeply invested and I left the theater wanting the story to continue. Let’s hope Part II gets made. Despite being 2 1/2 hours long, there seemed to be a lot of things not in this film. The Voice shook the damn theater. Thought I was going to shit myself, it was nuts. Did anyone else notice the interior of the large navigator ship? It had a giant reflection of a planet like it was being seen through a massive lens.. Folding space never looked so good. Oscar Isaac was born to act in sci-fi films lmfao [removed] Whoever they cast for that Imperial Herald was GREAT I was surprised and impressed how much they committed to different houses/cultures speaking in entirely different languages that needed subtitles, when they easily *could* have just had them speak to each other openly (Sardaukar, Harkonnens, etc).  Way more subtitles than they really “had to” use.  But it really emphasized how entirely distinct some of these groups are from each other. I really enjoyed Leto and Paul's interactions. It was refreshing to see a loving father and son relationship under the pressure of royalty. Leto was understanding of Paul's trepidation. thufir's mentat eyes flipping and turning that milky white while he computed was so damn cool I just can't stop thinking about clean shaven Momoa, such a weird sight. “I recognize your footsteps, old man.”

I’m currently reading God Emperor so this line gave me chills. This movie has the greatest gigantic-empty-room-to-furniture ratio I’ve ever seen. Rooms the size of a basketball court, fifty foot ceilings, furnished with two chairs and bench. Maybe I'm forgetting, but what happened with Josh Brolin's character after the attack? A guy just hanging out with his cool mom. Great flick. Oscar Isaac has an amazing beard. Im shook.
Honestly, I havent felt this way about a movie and the experience itself since maybe The Dark Knight. Say what you want about the movie but no one can deny that Paul has some great jackets. What the *hell* was the spider thing on Giedi Prime? The way Paul kills Jamis is the same move bull fighters use. The sardakar quietly floating down before battles was so damn cool.   Not sure if that was movie specific but those entrances were so ominous I loved it ",1
93," Oh this was wonderful. I thought the movie was great overall, but those last ten minutes were pure art The main character Jesper reminded me of Kuzco from The Emperor's New Groove in good ways. 

Honestly, I think this film scratched an itch for films exactly like The Emperor's New Groove and to a lesser extent, The Road to El Dorado. Likeable characters, well-choreographed physical comedy, and gorgeous character animation. [deleted] I hadn't heard a single thing about this movie until I saw it on Netflix while I was browsing late last night.  I decided to check it out because I liked the animation style, and wow, I totally wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. A cute beautiful looking film

It's a shame it's not getting any buzz My favorite animated movie of the year.  The animation style is beautiful and the characters are very charismatic. Hope it becomes a Christmas classic with the time.
8.5/10 Best animated film of the year, hands down. You can’t get any better than quality hand-drawn 2D animation and a simple but effective story about redemption and hope.

Is it okay for me to say that this film felt more Disney-like than anything Disney’s put out in years? I know it’s because director Sergio Pablos worked on animation for some of the films during the Renaissance period, but still. It made me feel nostalgic in a way very few modern films have. I want more movies in the traditional style made. This was absolutely gorgeous! Pablos' work at Disney really shown through here. Beautiful movie. Maryu was the most adorable thing I've ever seen. With the PG rating is there anything that would spoil Christmas for the kids who are still believers? The wife decided she wanted to watch a Christmas tonight and thought here we go again, another movie i've seen umpteen times then I remembered this came out today. Showed her the youtube clip and so glad she said yes,

Twas myself, wife and 6 year old and then my 15 year came in after 15 minutes to watch it. Was surprisingly good and could watch it again nearer Christmas. As an ex-animator, i can safely say that Klaus has some of the most beautiful and spectacular looking animations, environments, characters and effects i have ever seen. The mix between 2D traditional animation and 3D CGI Lights, really give a stunning aesthetic.

The story is amazing, other than a few clichés (You'll know when you see it), the characters are lovely, although i would have liked a bit more development about them in some occasions. You will laugh, cry and love this movie.

9/10 Animation and lighting in the film is just incredible >!The little girl on the bridge as Jesper's boat leaves nearly broke me I swear!<

Great movie! Like many comments say; it seems like it might be boring but it will definitely catch you by surprise. Had some kuzco vibes with the main character The little Sami girl is so fucking adorable. I can't handle the cuteness! Animation

10/10. Beyond 10/10. This movie is a work of art.

Storytelling

8/10. Charming if a bit typical. No significant plotholes but nothing new or surprising, either.

Music choice

5/10. Shit was wack.

Overall

8.5/10, recommend as a MUST WATCH for lovers of all things animation. In terms of a movie itself, it's alright. You'll probably see the plot beats coming a mile away but they're all executed so well it doesn't even matter. Every character is endearing and it really gets to what the Christmas spirit should all be about, good will towards man. 

I have a soft spot for movies about people just being good to each other out of the kindness of their hearts and I shed a few tears watching this movie because of it (I'm also kind of a whimp to be fair). 

And on top of all that, the jokes pretty much all land, the animation style it truly gorgeous and the voice acting is top notch. This is right up there with Arthur Christmas as one of my favorite Christmas movies that I will be watching every year. 

Also side note, WATCH ARTHUR CHRISTMAS PEOPLE!!! It's unfortunate that movies like this no longer get a theatrical release. I get why they didn't release it in theaters, no way could it compete against the monster that is Disney (Frozen II in Nov and Star Wars in Dec). It's a shame though as this movie is a million times better than anything Disney has put out in years. Disney better watch their backs if Netflix can keep delivering animated stuff of this quality. [deleted] Such a good movie. The animation was gorgeous and the little girl Margu stole the show with her cuteness. I hope the lighting SPA pioneered with this film gets picked up by other studios. Christ the ending had me blubbering. I just finished it 5 minutes ago. I did not expect myself to be crying from the last 10 minutes. The animation is amazing as well. The plot isn't something new, but it's still good enough to watch. I hope we get to see more 2d films. I loved this movie. 9/10 Well, that was lovely. Overall I’d probably give it 8.5/10, it’s definitely going to be one of the better, if not *the* best, Christmas thing netflix puts out this year. The animation was lovely, particularly the backgrounds though I loved the character design, and the writing felt fresh and clever, surprisingly, managing not to rely on tropes too much. Also, I felt like the latter parts of the movie had better pacing than the first parts, but maybe it just took me a little while to get used to the art style and let myself get taken in by the whimsy. Every actor was also great, but the fact that they were famous definitely took me out a little (that’s a nitpick though). And oh fuck, that last scene broke me. The writers are excellent. 
  
My two main gripes would probably be music and general plot, though to me both of those stunk of executive meddling. I’ve found that when I’m watching or playing anything, I have a stronger emotional response to the music than others so perhaps this didn’t matter as much to others, but for me the use of music definitely wasn’t as good as it good be, though ranging from tear-jerking to generic to just straight up out of place. In fact, I’d say that sometimes the music contributed to the bad pacing in the first part of the movie because the later I didn’t feel that same tonal dissonance. The movie first truly gripped me when the first kid got his toy and they had that lovely moving shot... and then just after they played “How You Like Me Now” and I was just like O-O. Though I think the later use of pop songs was better (though not the best),  particularly when Margu got her sled. Then there were occasions when I felt like the score could’ve been from literally any movie and it took me out as well, but similar there was some great stuff too. Again though, it’s not like the *screenwriter* was the one who *desperately* begged to have How You Like Me Now, is it 🙃 
  
My second gripe is with the plot. Now, like I said I think the writing is excellent, but there were just some times when I felt like there were tropes where there didn’t need to be, for example Jesper’s 6000 blowing up in his face. See, I still feel like that must’ve been notes from higher up tho, because the writers just had too many amazing moments for that to be them, imo. Like I said, the ending, but also things like the kids’ relationships, and Alva’s storyline, and Klaus’ backstory, and Margu getting her sled etc.  
  
Despite how much I just wrote about those two things (lol) I still feel like this movie was great, they’re just minor gripes. I would pay to see this movie in cinemas and not be one bit disappointed, which is saying a lot considering what Netflix typically produces. Strong recommend ",0
145," Went in expecting Jon Bernthal to be like the head bad guy or some shit. He absolutely killed it in his little part and I felt for him so much. He died fighting and even though it wasn't enough, it shows just how genuine/good his character was. When they reveal Natalie(?) is dating an older guy I ultimately assumed he was a manipulative asshole. I was wrong and now my heart hurts. The ""WHY ARE YOU FLANKING ME?"" Mexican standoff was awesome.  How good was the reveal of Jon Bernthal? When we think he's the Pete character, and then he opens the door and we realize it's a flashback. That was a small moment that was perfectly executed from a writing and directing standpoint.  The tension building up when they visit the oil rig followed by the shootout... holy shit.

Really good film overall. Loving all of Taylor Sheridan's work so far. He really nails the modern western feel, even when he is trying something different - like a thriller set in the Winds.

The dialogue was a little over the top with the whole ""we are in wyoming"" thing but it didnt really bother me.

Fantastic acting all around.            Really solid crime story here. Very smartly written; all the performances were great. Especially Elizabeth Olsen. Probably her best performance since *Martha Marcy May Marlene*. 

Taylor Sheridan has written three great movies and this was a very strong directorial debut. I can't wait to see what's next for him, because thus far he's been killing it. 

I'm really glad they didn't go the serial killer route. It was just a terrible set of circumstances and some downright evil decisions made by some drunk guys. Nothing premeditated, no connection to the death of Jeremy Renner's daughter, no super creepy killer who stalks the police, just a really sad and fucked up situation. I absolutely love the way he handled the reveal of what actually happened to Matt and Natalie.

Cutting away from Jane knocking at the door to go to the flashback, where you see the awful things that happened within those sleeping quarters.  The tension building up as you watch that flashback and know that Jane is walking right into a trap, and then cutting back to the present where you're extremely on edge because you know something awful is about to happen.

That whole sequence was perfect.    They really made James Jordan (Pete) look like a completely depraved, disgusting, and pathetic man. Jon Bernthal showing why he's best for the punisher role. Solid flick. This man sure knows how to build suspense. The border scene in Sicario and the ""flanking"" scene in this? Wonder what he could do with a horror movie. 

Anyway, it was cool to see the twist play out with the boyfriend actually turning out to be a good guy. I'd highly recommend this movie. Reminded me of Prisoners just a lot shorter.  Goddamn, that shootout was the most satisfying I have ever seen in my entire life. He just annihilated them! 

Any idea what caliber his rifle was? Got back from this an hour ago and it's one of the best films of the year. Everything from the acting to the characterization to the dialogue to the cinematography to the tension to the atmosphere works perfectly. Another home run from Taylor Sheridan. I actually went to watch this yesterday(& Logan Lucky tonight) and man... this was a solid flick.  It felt like part-thriller & part-drama with a few dark moments here and there but strong acting, dialogue and overall storytelling.  



- The line that hit me the most was Cory's ""Steer from the pain"" speech.  Even though I've never experienced the pain of loss myself, that talk he gave to Natalie's father hit me hard and I started to tear up right in the middle of that scene.  


- Renner and Olsen did really well.  She really sold it as the rookie agent and Renner played the hell out of the silent, level-headed, badass game-hunter.


- A very satisfying conclusion seeing those assholes getting snuffed by Cory and helping find justice and answers for Natalie, even if it meant sacrificing him finding closure for Emily.


It's sad to see the turnout was so low and that only two theaters(not just in my city but my whole area) were playing this film.  This is definitely worth a viewing and Taylor Sheridan deserves more work.. Very well made. Wasn't really sure what to expect from Sheridan's directorial debut but this movie really blew me away. The screenplay was top notch as usual and he was able to build some great tension during the action scenes and even during simple conversations. The cinematography is also very beautiful with a lot of landscape shots. 

This is a career best performance from Elizabeth Olsen and one of Jeremy Renner's best over the last few years. 

I also appreciated how some of the darker aspects of this situation weren't shied away from and the character's actions did have consequences. Since this is the last movie in his unofficial western trilogy, Sheridan is going out on a very high note. 

I still can't believe the cop from Sons of Anarchy is directing movies now.  All I have to say is wow. I'm going to be recommending this movie to a lot of people. Fantastic performances from Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olson, Graham Greene was great as always, and while I always love Gil Birmingham he went above and beyond. His scenes were very emotional and I really felt his pain.

The cinematography was phenomenal as well. I can't say enough good things about this movie. I don't think I've ever experienced tension as I did in the climax of this movie. I just clenched my chest with my fingers harder and harder, and couldn't let go. 

I love the kind of modern western theme Sheridan went for in his last two movies, and I love how he uses political and social climate in the US as a setting for the movies, as reasons for the conflict. The atmosphere and structure/pacing seem to be his strongest abilities.

Also, holy shit, Olsen and Renner. Between this mediocre blockbuster and that mediocre blockbuster, I forgot these people can act. They just blew me away with their performances (especially Renner).

A stunning achievement of a debut. Man, there was some cool editing in this movie!! I love when Cory stomping on the guy's face outside the trailer cuts into Jane kicking in the door. I also really loved the first person perspective after she was maced.

I also really loved the [tension building between the federal agents and the workers. All hell broke loose once Jane was shot through the door and flew back, it was like an erupting volcano](#spoiler)

I hadn't seen a single trailer for this film before I saw it and decided to see it because I liked Hell or High Water and it seemed like a great story. Ended up being one of the best movies I've seen all year. How the fuck is this movie not getting a bigger release? Sicario was an amazing film and Hell or High Water was nominated for Best Picture. The third film of this brilliant trilogy is getting a very slow limited release. This film is hopefully going to get a buzz like Hell or High Water. I don't get why studios would bury this film in the dreck of summer rather than in fall. This movie is almost guaranteed a Screenwriting nomination. The way that the cabin scene was introduced (Matt opening the door to let Natalie in, when you thought you would see Olsen's character) was amazingly clever and a surprise to me. Excellent editing.  Turns out Sheridan can direct a hell of a shootout. I loved this film. My take: if you were looking for a mystery/thriller film, you probably ended up disappointed, as it was a pretty straight forward story that lacked intensity, save for a scene or two. However, I thought the film did an incredible job of using a run of the mill double homicide as a vehicle to transport its central themes: the static and trapped life on a Native American Reservation and how suffering is the best way to acknowledge loss. Every character touched my the central conflict in the story showed these themes in some way, but you really just needed to see the final scene to get the essence of the film. 

[When Jeremy Renner turns to the father and says ""I'm going nowhere"" or something to that affect he really got at the crux of the film: the people on this reservation are stuck, both in their traditions, lack of social mobility, and physical distance from the outside world. I thought it was especially telling how the camera panned behind them afterwards, and the way the swing set was positioned around the two of them, it looked like they were in a teepee overlooking the desolate landscape](#spoiler) Really impressive film, did an amazing job portraying its central themes, thoroughly enjoyed it. Interested to hear if others found it as powerful. this movie gave me a revenge boner Can someone tell me...when Cory saw the tracks leading to Matt from the drug house...who left them. nobody has mentioned how well they choreographed the slow escalation of the fight/rape scene. each person kept escalating until it turned into a full out melee Gil Birmingham was fantastic in his smaller role. I'm starting to love this guy. I didn't really know him before Hell or Highwater (where he was hilarious). Started watching House of Cards last week and I was pleased to see him in season two. Then he makes me weep like a baby at the end of Wind River. Anyone have any recommendations for projects he's in? Absolutely loved it. Favorite movie of the year. Renner's ex-wife was a little too stoic for her part, but loved everyone else. Wasn't expecting Bernthal's character to actually be a good guy, but as soon as the other guys came back it was pretty obvious what was going to happen to her. He sure put up a hell of a fight though. Renner nailed his part too . I would say all of Sheridan's 3 movies are probably my favorites of the years they came out.  ",0
74," Brad Pitt tripping on acid pointing the finger gun at Tex was my favorite movie scene in a long time! I loved that Rick told Cliff that he was ""One pool party away from a big break"" and Rick ended up burning the final Manson girl IN THE POOL to finally get friendly with Sharon Tate and her friends “More than a brother but not quite a wife.”

That’s the take away line of the film for me. That scene where DiCaprio tells himself he won’t drink, then proceeds to chug out of the flask and spits it out? I felt that. That scene at the ranch when Cliff was going in to check on George Spahn was so fucking tense. Even the music from the TV was foreboding as hell.

And holy shit, I didn't even realize that was Dakota Fanning. Totally didn't recognize her. I am so, so glad that there wasn’t any acrimony between Cliff and Rick. A surprisingly wholesome take on male friendship. I was genuinely nervous for Cliff's well being in those final scenes. Not often a film does this for me, and for that reason alone this was an awesome experience. Enjoyed it a lot. Jesus fucking Christ Tarantino loves feet I need a Rick Dalton spaghetti western movie poster more than anything. Brandy is a good girl This movie really showcased how great of an actor Leo is. The scene where he throws the girl actually made me forget what movie I was watching. Tarantino wants us to know that extremely attractive women snore Brad and Leo had some great commentary watching his scene in FBI

Devil shit.” When Cliff chucked the dog food can at her face then told the police that Tex was talking about “Devil shit”, I had tears in my eyes from laughing In this thread, I’ve seen a lot of people talking about Pitt’s performance. And don’t get me wrong, him killing hippies while tripping on acid is an all-time Tarantino scene...but this is a top 3 DiCaprio performance. The insecure TV star in the back half of his career is just pure gold...and there are at least 3 scenes that I found myself dumbstruck by his performance. The scene by himself in the trailer after he breaks; the conversation with the little girl about his novel (and what a performance by her as well); and the final climactic scene (flame thrower and “Well, the fucking hippies ain’t, I’ll tell you that). Just a masterclass from DiCaprio. He’s the best we’ve got. The whole set up of Cliff having the flashback of why Kurt Russell’s character didn’t want to cast him was pure gold.

“Fair enough.” “Hey, can you do something bout the heat?”

“Rick.... its a flamethrower”

💀 Imagine stopping the Manson murders while on acid. An hour of this movie is Brad Pitt driving around LA The most satisfying use of Chekhov’s Gun I’ve ever seen in film.

That whole ending was a riot in the best way possible. Please go see it with a packed opening weekend crowd. The more I think about it, the more I like it. Was anyone else really entertained by Leo's Italian wife at the end? Especially when she punched the Manson girl. This movie further solidifies that Brad Pitt and Tarantino are a match made in heaven. “Are you real?”

95," Just here to point out the original story was a One Direction Fan Fiction. Hardin gave off a real Aniken Skywalker vibe. The after series started as one direction fan fiction. The source material is very rinse and repeat and this movie is not much different. The acting is sub-par, with no emotional connection between the leads. They had to fast track so many moment from the book to cram it into a movie that the characters move too fast to make sense, even as young adults making poor decisions. All the crazy conflict from the book is no where to be found in the film, deflating it even further.

2/10, would never watch this movie again. I’m not saying that to be mean either, it just makes no sense to make such an expansive fan fiction into a film like this. In my eyes, it was never going to work. 

I don’t recommend the books either. I think there's nothing inherently wrong with fan fiction - it's fictional characters put in alternative fictional universes, nobody gets hurt and it's a ton of fun.  
I personally don't know any fanfics that are legitimately great (send them to me if you have some), but there's nothing saying that can't be.  

But I feel that fanfics about an actual person cross some line.  

Even if we all know that they intentionally created a persona as part of the band, so the Harry Styles this is written about is almost as fictional as Edward from Twilight, it is still very creepy to me.

Like writing and publishing entire sex scenes where one of the people is an actual living person who didn't consent to being in this story has to feel wrong, right?

I guess it's not very different than what tabloids are doing, but everyone hates them. Watched it yesterday with my gf and man we both hated so much this is by far the worst movie i went to watch in theaters My girlfriend and I both enjoy Harry Styles, and I guess she read this fanfiction back in middle school? We thought it’d be funny to watch this, like a “so bad it’s good” kind of thing. Turns out it’s just aggressively mediocre and extremely boring. It just kinda sucks. Wouldn’t recommend even as a joke. I just don't get why Hardin didn't call off the bet when he was falling in love with Tessa? Like if he loved her why did he still show his friends the condom and the bloody sheets? Haven’t seen, I just have a question. Is the relationship in the movie as toxic and abusive as it is in the books? I read them when I was about thirteen. Why does that movie still have no RT score? It opened in over 2000 theatres, there should normally be some reviews for it.

EDIT: 
There are already some reviews on RT, all rotten at the moment: RT score 0%

Metacritic score: 31 at my theater this sells pretty fucking well why is it so dead here This movie is just terrible! I read the books last month because I wanted to go see the movie and I was really disappointed. They messed up everything in the book! All the details that make it something have been put aside, the movie is completely rushed and does not make any sense .... It's just sad how Anna Todd sells for half a dozen dollars! Honestly, I didn't hate it as much as I thought I would. I came in with pretty low expectations and was... left feeling disappointed? The plot was as I expected it to be, much too rushed. Their relationship forms too quickly and not organically in the slightest. They told each other very intimate details of their lives far too quickly and they moved in with each other far too fast. The two lead actors had okay chemistry and aside from the atrocious British accent, there wasn't anything that really pissed me off about the acting. The girl could play the nerdy virgin and the dude could play the bad boy with a ""deep side"" (hint hint, drinking problems and daddy issues). There was a toxic relationship that gets really played down. Harding beats up one of their mutual friends for attempting to kiss her though they're not even dating and it struck me as very possessive. After the ""big reveal"" I just lost all hope. In all honesty, it was a bit surprising that Tessa would go back to Harding, but then I remembered, it was adapted from a Wattpad fan fiction. I've read many a Wattpad fanfic in my younger years and this was the same unoriginal plot and toxic relationship. Don't come to this movie with high expectations. My friends and I spent our time ragging on the movie which was pretty fun. I’m a guy who usually enjoys all kinds of romance, and despite knowing the origins of After (fan fiction and the book) I didn’t know what the film would be about. Personally, I don’t find anything wrong with it except that it is kinda boring, nothing really interesting happens and the relation between the two mains is very mundane. I don’t see why you would put that into a film, if the guy was more of a mess or even violent it would have given some depth.

Went to see it with me mum and being a 50 Shades of Grey fan, she said she liked After better. So if you liked 50 Shades, you heard me mum. I read these books a long time ago.. i got completely sucked in for some mad reason. So when i saw the  movie pop up on Netflix, I just had to watch it. I think the movie was a healthier way of portraying the relationship, which was good idea.  But one thing that drove me absolutely crazy was the fact that Hero FT kept his eyes open during a lot of the kissing scenes which I found sooo weird. I copped it from the lake scene and numerous kissing scenes!! How on earth was it not said to him when they were filming??? i’m just rlly looking forward to awc , i think we are gonna see a lot more of the book hardin that we all love! and adore also they had to make it pg 13 which made their relationship look like a semi healthy relationship but in awc i think they’re gonna be a lot more book hessa scenes that we all love and need!!!! i know this is old now, but I am just getting to watch these. can someone explain to me if Tessa loses her virginity in the scene she comforts Hardin in his house after he destroys things in a drunken rage? I feel like they first have sex after his dads wedding, but they fooled around earlier in the movie too, and it wasn’t obvious if they had sex there. [I listened to a review of the novel](http://www.frowl.org/worstbestsellers/episode-119-after/) and the author apparently had no idea how college worked because it's treated like high school in the book. Which makes sense because I'm pretty sure the author was in high school when she wrote it. it also reads like a sex crimes playbook. Glad to hear this is terrible. Made my night. Hoping for worse ratings that Hellboy here! Unpopular opinion here but I enjoyed the movie and will watch it again when it's released.  I don't think it would be a good movie for someone to watch that hasn't read the books. Granted, the movie is very mild compared to the books, but I think they did an ok job portraying the characters.

I think the movies layout was like that to introduce the characters to people that haven't read the books. I think if it gets approved for another movie that the 2nd installment will have more meat in it.
 
If you liked fifty shades of grey, twilight, or anything with that sort of ""bad boy,"" ""good girl"" vibe, then you will enjoy the series. I agree. But I'm guessing people take it in the same vein as shows or movies that have actual actors playing them. Like are the writers really thinking about iron man and captain America in a romantic relationship or are they actually thinking about the actors. 

I don't know, rambling. Wait where was that in the movie ? I saw it twice and I missed that I personally think that he was trying to fight that he loved her and this it was a form of self sabotage. He didn’t think he deserved Tessa and he didn’t want to admit to his feelings for her so he was being a childish asshole. It’s WAY I mean WAY more toxic in the books. 
I’ve read the After books on wattpad and what you see in the movie is like 1/10th of what’s in the books. ",0
132," Man. The whole movie is great, but that scene where Lady Bird finally confronts Danny about being gay and instead he just breaks down crying and she comforts him was the moment I fell in love with it. Such a 180 of where I thought that scene would go.  ""Are you and mom going to get a divorce?""

""No. We can't afford to.""

I don't know why but i thought it was the funniest joke in the whole movie. ""Some people aren't built happy."" Floored me. Half way through the movie the older couple sitting next to me had this exchange.

Man: ""I don't know what this film is about""
Woman: ""yes i agree, i'm sorry honey this was a bad choice""

At the end of the film they were both sobbing.  timothee's character Kyle had my audience in stitches with every word he said. one of my favourites of the year!  The first act kinda felt like Wes Anderson doing ""Napoleon Dynamite"", I loved it  I love that we are now getting at a point where we can have early 2000s period pieces. This movie perfectly encapsulated that time in so many scenes throughout the movie, doing it hilariously so every time.

My favorite example of it was the use of ""Crash Into Me"". It reminded me a lot of the use of ""Drops of Jupiter"" in the movie Other People. Taking a song that we've heard before and using it in a stereotypical way at first and then using it later on in the film to help get to the emotional core. It's a welcome trend for me and has changed my opinion on both of those songs.

It was also just a surprising hilarious film altogether. I was expecting it to be funny, but not nearly as funny as it actually was. The awkward scenes at the Catholic school, the way that Kyle first mentions his father's cancer, and the scene where Lady Bird's dad was just playing solitare while Lady Bird and her mom fought all had me bent over laughing.

Just a beautifully orchestrated, loving, tender film about growing up and realizing that your parents are people too. Loved everything about it. I would have watched 8 more hours of it. The scene with Lucas Hedges crying into Ronan was the best  highlight for me (in a movie full of highlights). Almost started crying myself. The Ronan/Metcalf relationship was unbelievably real & familiar.

The most laughs I've had at a theater this year (mixed in with teary-eyed moments). Just a great script, direction, performances.

Greta Gerwig can do no wrong at this point. Ronan's accent was super impressive and she jumped to number one on my Best Actress prediction so far. Chalamet's character was great, his delivery gave me a Nicolas Cage vibe for some reason (no idea why, doesn't make sense, but made me laugh a bit).

Also, what a year for Tracy Letts. The Post, Lady Bird, The Lovers. Didn't like that last one at all, but that's an impressive year.

Easily top 5 of the year, 9/10. The scene with Lady Bird and Danny outside the back of the coffee shop broke my heart. So well acted on both side. Cried my eyes out. One of the best debuts of all time.

""I'm sorry I wanted more."" When Timothee Chamelet's character said ""that's hella tight"" I was the loudest laugh in the theater. This is a beautiful movie, easily the best I've seen this year and one of my favourite coming-of-age movies period.

Every part is perfectly cast and expertly played. Ronan and Metcalf will get the Oscar attention, but the whole ensemble deserves recognition. 

The scene where Lady Bird is in Sister Sarah Joan's office and they discuss how there's no difference between love and paying attention is a perfect way to encapsulate the entire movie.

An actual 10/10. See this movie.  Lucas Hedges is absolutely killing it right now. Played a major role in three straight releases that will likely be Best Picture nominations (Manchester by the Sea, Lady Bird, Three Billboards). And an Oscar nomination for himself in there, as well.  I liked that we didn't get the cliche airport scene at the end. The Mom got there too late and that was that. That's life sometimes... Honestly was surprised by the powerful punch at the end of the film.  As a guy, I don't know what relationships are like between mother and daughter, so it was refreshing to see a film that seemed pretty authentic in it's depiction of a mother and daughter.  Loved the performances and hope it picks up a few Oscar nods so more people will see this wonderful film. Wow. Hope this gets all the recognition it deserves. Absolutely in the top three movies I've seen this year. Saorise Ronan is amazing. What a debut for Greta Gerwig.  This film is one of two things:

1. For the people who relate to it: painful, cuttingly real, upsetting, difficult, emotionally triggering to the point that someone might relive the emotional abuse of their adolescent years...

2. For the people who don't relate to it: a pretty good movie, yeah like the acting is good and stuff, interesting... Man having gone to Catholic high school, everything was just so dead on perfect. I laughed so hard at the JV coach becoming the drama teacher and they way he was still like a coach to them. Or the anarchist kid who’s still going to a private high school. So many great little touches like that.

Yeah I’ll admit it, I cried at the end. Wasn’t even expecting it, just a very perfect kind of melancholy. I also grew up in kind of a boring town but they way she talked about driving it for the first time and relating it her mom was so touching. What a perfect way to end a film.

Can we just point out we are in a quiet amazing time for teen movies this decade? Easy A, The Spectacular Now, Diary of a Teenage Girl, The Edge of Seventeen and now I think the best of them yet Lady Bird. I think we are finally having directors reflecting on the more poppy teen romances and trying to make something more grounded and honest. 

Last thing this is probably my favorite film of the year (check back with me in a week to see where I feel then) and if Saoirse and Gerwig could make do like a Before Trilogy thing and just make a film Lady Bird about Lady Bird every 10 years that would just be the best. Or at least please work together again.

Okay serious last thing but who knew the guy who wrote Bug and Killer Joe could play like the most charming, cuddly dad in movie history? As someone who was in the orbit of several people who went to Catholic high school in Sacramento in the late 90s and early 00s this movie is dead on.

The movie is near-perfect at encapsulating all the things that make Sacramento unique and the things that always annoyed you, but you didn't realize you love until you leave the city.

I loved the little bits of local character like New Hel and The American Market on 24th.

The only way it could have been more nostalgic for me is if they recreated the back patio of the True Love. Lady Bird walking to the church in New York and making that call to her mom is probably my favorite moment of 2017. The cuts between her and her mom driving though Sacramento gave me the biggest smile. Just everything about it was perfect.

Movie really is something special. So happy Greta is getting all this love, and Saoirse was amazing. Probably my fav of 2017 When I was in high school, I wanted more than anything to go to Sarah Lawrence. I wasn't so much searching-for-culture as Lady Bird was, more of a ""this is the kind of place where writers come from"" sort of a thing. By the time my senior year came by, I didn't even apply, for two reasons. One was a sudden fear of being so far from literally everyone and everything I knew. The other was the realization that my parents had not only never HEARD of application fees, but that coming up with them suddenly was genuinely a hardship. I graduated in 2007, not 2003, I went to public school and not Catholic school, and I was honestly a lot more like Julie than Lady Bird, but goddamn did this movie hit on more than a few unexpected tender spots. 

On an aside, the tears started at the climax, because, God, my mom's favorite punishment was the silent treatment. Often inflicted on the whole family, who usually honestly couldn't tell you who did what.  A lot of scenes between Lady Bird and her mother are just stories right out of my own book. It brought back bad memories and made me feel absolutely awful. I almost cried when they were in the fitting room and she asked “but do you like me?” 

My mother is exactly the same: passive aggressive and never satisfied with what I do. She also didn’t want me to go to a university far from home because she was almost obsessed with the idea of me never leaving her side, and I fought for it just like Lady Bird. And like Lady Bird, I love her and know how much she loves me but can’t help admitting that she doesn’t like me as a person and we will likely never truly understand each other. 

As the only 20 year old girl in the theatre, I felt I might be the only person who really empathized and understood Lady Bird’s entire perceptive. The old ladies around me were all kind of amused. This was an awesome movie. Having just entered Freshman year of college, it's weird now to be older than the kids going through these coming of age stories. I hope that unique stories like these continue to be relatable as I get older. Movies like these make me really not want to be a grown up.  This film was a barrage of these small moments that were relatable, sad and funny (often all at once). The scene where Christine is just begging her mother to talk to her stands out for me as absolutely heartwrenching. Saoirse perfectly captured that desperate, fearful need of a child finally experiencing a parent's withholding of attention. That scene alone I'd give her an award for, and that goes without mentioning her superb job all through the film, with great supporting performances as well. You know who I liked? The dopey dad. Just seeing him staring down at the ground, pausing his inane card game on the family Dell, while his wife and only daughter dig their heels in a particularly nasty spat, was such a memorable image.

43," Chadwick's performance is unforgettable. Viola is good too but Chadwick steals the show. I know Chadwick Boseman's undeniably superb performance will get the most interest due his tragic passing but holy hell, Viola Davis is really one of the beat actresses of all time. The physicality she brings to the role was something only a masterclass actor could pull off. The performances are truly great but the film itself was just okay. What works as a stage play doesn't necessarily translate to film. The film needed a better screenwriter who could adapt the play for the screen. It's still worth watching just for the performances though. Levee was an ambitious man who told people he was in complete control but really had no say or control other than what he says. When he didn't get what he wanted at the end he displaced all those negative feelings on to someone else, with terrible results. I feel for the guy and have met guys like that growing up. There’s nothing I can say about Viola or Chadwick that hasn’t already been said. So instead, I’ll say this: this year Colman Domingo has easily cemented himself as one of my favorites in Hollywood, to the point where I’ll see something without knowing anything about it simply because Colman is in it. Somewhat random and unrelated, but last year, Netflix released a documentary mini series following Kevin Hart and the fallout from his anti-LGBTQ comments and subsequent bowing out from hosting the Oscars.

One episode covered Hart's production company, wherein he pitched to Chadwick Boseman his idea for a movie. I can't recall the details, but I do remember Hart making a big deal out of it and figuring it was a ""sure thing"" that Boseman would star in his bullshit movie.

During the pitch meeting, Boseman turned Hart down, basically saying he's careful about the roles he chooses and the impact they may have. At the time, I didn't think much about his reasoning for declining the part. Knowing now that he was battling terminal cancer when he met with Hart however, puts that segment from the episode into an entirely new light.

Boseman didn't want to be remembered for quick payday roles in stupid lowest common denominator comedies, like Hart. His decision to play Levee in *Ma Rainey's Black Bottom* makes so much sense now, as this will be one of the roles for which he will be forever remembered. Deservedly so. So, what are y'all thinking about the end where Levee kills Toledo? I was interpreting it as the yellow shoes being symbolic of his optimism for the future and his come up, and Toledo's clodhoppers are Black folks' past, stepping all over and messing up his dreams. Something about Chadwick Boseman's final role involving him talking about his ambitions and how bright his future is going to be just feels like one more punch to the gut. I didn't find the narrative particularly interesting but the performances are absolutely outstanding. It makes sense, I suppose, being based on a play that it's very much a performance heavy film.

I kind of felt that the ending (with Toledo's death) came out of nowhere but I understand the point that the film/play is trying to make. Despite all his talk, Levee is deeply traumatized by what happened to his parents and to him and he is walking around with all this rage and anger trying to turn it into something. He tries at first to channel it into his music and he is talented but he's stymied by the opportunities he can get (also I totally assumed that Mr. Irvin was stealing his songs to give them to another band - I was shocked he even offered to pay for them at the end. After all, why take the songs if you aren't planning to use them?). Some of Levee's problems are of his own making, of course, he's obnoxious, he's rude and he's combative and that certainly doesn't help you get any further in life and he throws away a good opportunity with Ma Rainey's band because he doesn't want to just follow the rules. Anyway in the end, I thought at first that he would stab Mr. Irvin because of Chekov's knife and all but instead he turns that violence onto an innocent person, someone who is just as oppressed as he is, someone who has shown him nothing but kindness for the most part - in part, because he knows from his father's experience, that he could never kill a white man and get away with it (not that Irvin deserved to die for stealing someone's music). It's a very heavy ending. 

I find that this era of American plays tend to deal heavily with the casualties of the American Dream. You're sold a bill of goods but they'll never come through for you and you spend your whole life chasing a phantom. I think those messages are still relevant, if not more so now, than they were when they were written. Boseman delivered a knockout in his last role. People might say that he gets the oscar because of his passing, but i truly believe he is earning it with this (and also the fact that the year seems weaker in general for awards) I just want to say that I don't think he really stepped on his shoes.... He couldn't fight the person who had really stepped on him... I'm surprised to find comments that the movie was slow or boring. Throughout the movie I was smitten by the amazing performances as well as the colorful personalities and perspectives of the characters. Their conversations and storytelling really laid it all out for us - each band member's life, beliefs, worries, traumas. One hour into the movie I was feeling for everyone in the band, even for the ambitious and erratic Levee. But it was really Ma Rainey who tied it all together at the end.

I could not help think ""God, Ma Rainey is being really difficult."" She came to the studio late, brought her stuttering nephew to take even more time recording, and threatened multiple times she won't record until everything is done her way.  I mean, I thought I knew why -- the music industry was brutal, especially for black musicians whose talents were appropriated shamelessly. As Ma Rainey puts it, they only want her voice.  But for me the real chills came with the scene where those white musicians were playing the song that Sturdyvant swindled from Levee for mere $5. Then Ma Rainey sitting in the backseat of her car looked straight back at the viewers, like she's saying ""see? I told you so."" That's gotta be my favorite scene, it was so poignant and heartbreaking. I watched the film last night but I'm still thinking about it.

What I'm still curious about is, what purpose do the characters Dussie Mae and Sylvester play? What does the writer (of the play & film) want to say through those two? Still haven't figured that out. Get Chadwick his Oscar NOW! Goddamnit that scene of him questioning God when we know that he was battling terminal cancer just crushed me. It’s a tragedy that he’s gone, but his last film is his best work ever. Wow. A one, a. two, a you know what to do.... So, I had the great pleasure of working on this film, and finally got to watch the end result.

Story wise, I think this works better as a live theater experience. However, I had the great pleasure of sitting in on a few meetings with the director and thinking back to him explaining his vision, I think he did a masterful job in pulling out the performances he got from Boseman and Davis. They are unbelievable.

Overall, a great story and very beautifully executed. Very proud to have been a part of this production in my capacity. I can only imagine how incredible this must be performed live. I’m going to miss you Chadwick I enjoyed learning about [August Wilson's cycle of ten plays](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Wilson#The_Pittsburgh_Cycle), each based on the African American experience in a different decade of the 20th century. This film is the one from the 20s, of course. It's the only one set in a location other than the playwright's native Pittsburgh.

The other play from this cycle that's been made into a movie is Fences, which I'm curious about now. Denzel Washington supposedly has plans to produce more. This movie feels like it was supposed to be longer. I thoroughly enjoyed this and am slightly appalled by some of the critiques I’ve seen

While it has largely been received well by critics and audiences alike, the negative reviews have condemned it as far too boring which I can’t agree with at all

The dialogue may have given the impression of rambling at times, more specially when the band members are interacting with each other, but each word uttered is reflective of the characters and their respective mindsets

Chadwick and Davis were exceptional of course, and I don’t see how one could view his performance with anything other than admiration and applause

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, perhaps more than I should? Maybe it comes down to me being seventeen and lacking a desire for further nuance in some aspects of the film but this was a great film with dynamic characters that highlighted aspects of Black film that aren’t frequently covered. Levee rejecting god is incredibly impactful because he’s a Black man and his reasons for doing so are unique at least based on the other films I’ve seen that try to highlight historical issues within the Black community. 

Some were also complaining about Ma’s personality and saying that she was too cruel or egotistical when she directly states why she treats the people around her like she does. The treatment of Black people in the music industry is still horrendous to this day, and you can see her message of them not caring about anything other than the money that comes with her voice and music become more blatant towards the end with Levee being told initially that he could record his songs then being told that they weren’t good enough only for them to be played by a White band (only further reflecting the ways in which Black inventions and art have been stolen).

Overall I really enjoyed this film, it’s an 8/10 for me undoubtedly. I actually would’ve liked it to be longer if anything. God DAMN Viola was captivating in this! Completely became Ma Rainey. And Boseman! God it was sad seeing him act his ass off in his last role ever :,(
I thought the superficial “green screen” look to everything kinda hindered the film but man were those performances amazing. The performances are excellent - especially Davis and  Boseman. I went into this cold and was mesmerized from start to finish. It’s a shame this is the last we’ll see of Boseman, he’s cocky, energetic, passionate, scary. The adaptation from stage to screen was not all that successful to me. That being said, Viola Davis was amazing. There was a physicality to her performance that transcended those stage limitations. The way she walked with her hip out, all plastered in makeup and sweat—commanding stuff. She was big when she needed to be, but other times sage-like or seductive. Really well-rounded performance. Contrary to many of the other comments, I felt it translated from stage to screen well.  The story is set in a recording studio, so finding ways to translate chunks of dialog to other settings would have been less realistic.  Viola Davis was so believable as Rainey and confident enough in her acting to look all sweaty and such.  The rest of the cast was great, too.

I saw a local production of Wilson’s Jitney a couple years ago and I hope Washington/Netflix do it soon.  It has a similar rhythm to the dialog and interplay between the characters Loved the scene when Sylvestre finally makes it and starts to dance proudly. For me personally the movie didn't settle well with me. I have not seen the play, but it makes sense that the way this story is told, it's better as a play. 

That being said Viola and Chadwick were thunderous in their acting prowess. Anyone interested in music, film, and Chadwick Boseman should watch ""Get On Up"" about the life story of James Brown.  Chadwick Boseman was phenomenal in that as he was in ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"" but ""Get on Up"" is a movie while MRBB is essentially a play that is filmed. ",0
178," BTW if you like this film or other Laika films, check out /r/laika. Really good subreddit in need of subscribers. Kubo *clearly* had three strings on his guitar. *Zero* stars. /s

But on a more serious note, my god was this movie absolutely gorgeous to look at and the soundtrack was amazing. Laika Studios has yet to disappoint me with anything they've put out. 

EDIT: In retrospect, a more fitting comment would have been:

>Before watching the movie: *Clearly* that instrument has three strings. *Zero* stars.

>After watching the movie: I understand, and I am crying. Real contrast between this movie and the trailers before it. Storks, Sing, etc. all of em just seemed like such obnoxious and low effort excuses for kids entertainment.

I really hope this has some legs. This is the kind of thing a kid will appreciate more and more as he/she get older. A meticulously crafted piece of art that never once talks down to them.  Kubo and the Two Strings is a must watch. The story is deeply embedded in Japanese folklore, borrowing many mythical elements from Japan's cultural roots. The visuals are completely mind blowing. Set design, action sequences, and general cinematography are stunning. At its core, it is an emotional story surrounding the themes of family, mortality, and the passage of memory. 

I cannot recommend this film enough. If any of you are on the fence about seeing this movie, please go see it. Currently, it is tracking to open around $10-15 million. I believe this film deserves a much warmer opening. With a smaller studio like Laika, this movie's success is paramount to ensure they are rewarded for their dedication to stop-motion. There needs to be more Kubos and less minions ""If you must blink, do it now.""

I was so impressed by this movie. From beginning to end it's lovely and beautiful and touching and hilarious and fun and wise and young and old. It was familiar, yet always surprising. Not short, but not long either. At once frightening and also positive.

Maybe the best movie I've seen this year. Highly recommend. I am entirely convinced that, whoever wrote this movie, lost at least one parent to Alzheimer. Memory it's the ultimate weapon in the movie, and loss of memory is a constant theme.  Can I just say Regina Spektor's cover for ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" during the end credits was fucking amazing? [deleted] This movie is not afraid to get dark. Like, even the first 5 minutes.

That's Laika's way. I have to say that was one of, if not the, most beautiful animated movies I've ever seen. The fact that it was stop motion was just mind-blowing. Wow, this movie is officially tied for the highest-rated wide-release movie on Metacritic so far this year (it currently has a score of 83). 

I would *never* have expected ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" and ""The Witch"" to have the 2 highest scores on Metacritic of 2016 in terms of wide-release movies.  Did anyone catch George Takei's character going ""Oh myyyyyy"" towards the beginning? The stop-motion seemed really good here, loved the set pieces. I spent most of the movie wondering why the title was ""Kubo and the *TWO* strings (as the guitar has three strings), but completely understood near the end. Really fantastic. Holy shit that was great! Every line McConaughey had was gold. I was worried I was going to be let down, but it was amazing. I fucking loved it. 

Sadly there was about 12 people total (including me) and that worries me a bit. Other than that, Kubo had me hooked really quickly. That soundtrack was soooooooooo wonderful and everyone of the characters had charm! This is a day one pick up for me once its out on Blu Ray! Everyone please go see this. As movie buffs we need to support films like these financially.  Kubos to Laika. 

I wouldn't say they're the next Pixar, as some have claimed, but I'd certainly see an argument as the next Aardman.

Also, nice to see Art Parkinson show some real zig-to-the-zag abilities this time. Kubo was all-around spectacular, but I just couldn't get one specific thought out of my head: Laika's probably animated the most phenomenal water I've ever seen in any animated medium. I hope this gets Laika their much deserved Oscar. What I absolutely loved was the resolution. Sure we have a sword fight *first*, but then we have forgiveness. The entire town coming together and embracing the Moon King was fantastic. Laika consistently *nails* alternate ways to resolve conflict. Like Paranorman before it, this movie really sells itself on its finale. Sure, the entire thing is amazing, but the ending really sold me on it overall.  This is definitely one of my favorite movies, full stop. 

Not this year, not of animated movies. I adored this film. This movie is absolutely amazing. It feels so alive and full of love, every character really comes to life on-screen. The fact that they all feel so real and alive when all they are is little puppets in a warehouse in Oregon is amazing. I honestly can't even believe stop-motion is a thing that can be this good. The amount of hard work, talent, and dedication needed to pull something like this off is extremely admirable.

But it would be pointless if the story or filmmaking was weak, and again Laika shows that they know what they are doing in that department. Not a single scene or second is wasted here. While it's basic plot is a pretty typical heroes journey, the characters, environments, poetic and gorgeous imagery, and the themes that were explored really elevate it well-beyond feeling anything close to cliche or recycled.

A lot of kids movies have got mile-a-minute storytelling, lots of pop tunes and upbeat music, flashy visuals, and are full of lame, lazy jokes. While some movies like that are decent and enjoyable, it was so great to see an animated ""kids"" movie that really respected the entire audience. While there are a lot of great jokes, action scenes, and it moves pretty quickly Kubo is a movie that isn't afraid to go to some dark places, or give some time to let the emotional scenes sink in. The kids in my audience were into it.

While some will write it off just because it's an animated movie, I think there really are some genuinely thoughtful and touching ideas explored here. The power and importance of storytelling, the nature of memory and loss, and even life and death are all touched upon and included in a natural and fitting way. I think this film has more on it's mind that a lot of adult dramas I've seen recently.

This movie has better action scenes and more imagination than any other big action blockbuster I've seen this year. I'm not sure what kind of research went into this, but it felt like an authentic portrayal of Asian culture, and made me want to learn more about it. 

I also loved how there weren't any exposition dumps about Kubo or his mother and their magic. He just played his instrument and the paper came to life. It was a confident and bold decision to introduce us and say ""yeah, he's magic, here's what he does, now let's get on with it."" Bold and confident are both adjectives I'd use to describe the film as a whole. The film had a very clear and unique sense of identity and purpose, and kept consistent the whole way through.

There are so many images in here that will be burned into my memory, particularly that scene where Kubo was underwater and there were all those giant eyes staring at him. This is one of the most gorgeous movies I've seen in so long, and I can't wait to see it again. Even the 3D was utilized well, something that I usually hate.

If I ever have kids, this will be a movie that I cannot wait to show them. I loved and adored everything about it. This is about as close to a perfect movie as you can get. My favorite of this year so far. 
 What a wonderful film! I took my 5 y.o. Son to see this and there were so many moments in the movie that parallel my time with my son. Kubo and his dad playing ""I Spy"", Hanzo teaching Kubo how to aim a bow and arrow (I just bought my son a slingshot and we practice his aiming). I have been waiting for a movie like this all year that we can both enjoy because ""Dory"" and ""Secret Life of Pets"" were both good but neither gave me that uplifting feeling this movie gave me.  Mostly, I just wish this movie was 40 minutes longer. The creation/animation of this movie is a triumph, but honestly, it doesn't earn a lot of it's major plot points. It probably would have delayed the movie's already long production time, but I would have loved to sit with and learn about the key characters longer than we did. ",0
68," The last 30 minutes were so brutally depressing Pesci sat at the airport for 3+ hours in the car just hanging out. Boss move. The whole “It is what it is” scene was fucking fantastic. The restaurant scene with Hoffa and Pro has to be one of the greatest things I've seen all year. 

Absolutely wonderful film. We already knew that Joe Pesci was an incredible actor but to come out of a 20 year retirement and give that performance is some legendary shit. Harvey Keitel is a cool mofo. ""What kind of a man makes a phone call like that...?"" One of the most affecting parts to me was at the end when De Niro was telling his nurse about how most people don’t even know who Jimmy Hoffa was anymore and it seems like he’s about to launch into some starry eyed story time and she politely but flippantly cuts him off to take his blood pressure and as soon as she’s done she walks off. “You always charge a guy with a gun - with a knife, you run away. So you charge with a gun - with a knife, you run”

Pacino’s performance was incredible! ""Your lawyer's dead""

""Who did it?""

""Cancer"" What stood out to me in the film is the way that Jimmy gets killed. We know it's coming, and we know that this will be Frank's most affecting and difficult murder. But based on just how their relationship is built and plays out through the film, I thought that it would culminate in Jimmy suddenly realizing that Frank will murder him and saying something like, ""Frank, how could you do this? I treated you like family. I loved you!"" - something that's drawn out and wrought with angst and tenderness before the act. But nope, as soon as he turns to the door, Frank just whips out his gun, fires twice in succession, and it's all over in a second. Frank murders Jimmy just like he did with the numerous other victims we saw - quick and emotionless, like it's all just part of the job (emphasizing the military parallel). It's disturbing because Jimmy truly loved and valued Frank, and Frank is agonizing over what he will have to do, and yet, the way he carries out the murder of his best friend, someone he said he will always back, is instinctive. It speaks volumes about Frank's lack of soul (or at least, it being so numb). I can't believe I'm spending my thanksgiving depressed over jimmy hoffa People in my theatre in the UK were laughing in the strangest places

I heard people laughing when Pesci struggles to eat the bread in prison and his hands were shaking. 

Thought was rather heartbreaking tbh. I loved how they introduced some of the characters with a text description, including their names and when and how they died/got killed. I think it's the essence of the movie, taking away instantly the ""coolness"" and ""glamour"" of being a gangster, seeing how almost always ends bad and how sad it is. When Frank was telling Russ that he told Jimmy he would meet him at 2, fuck man that scene gave me chills. I also liked how De Niro insisted on sitting on that backseat even though it was wet, goes to show how alert and aware he was on getting wacked. Damn the whole part with Pesci in the prison was just heartbreaking. That scene when Jo is fired and she hesitates before starting her car is one of the most tense things I've seen on film in years. He really was asking too many questions about that fish It's a small scene but the one that really got to me was when they show how Hoffa's body was cremated in secret and then it cuts to Frank who says ""it was no more complicated than that.""

I love that so much. It's just so unglamorous. Of course the answer to one of those great 20th century mysteries would be so simple and so not extraordinary. And even if that's not what actually happened to Hoffa you know the real truth is probably just as sad and mundane. It plays so well with the dour final act. Saw this a couple of weeks ago and still can’t get that Pacino/Pesci scene out of my head. With those it’s such a surprisingly tender scene of Hoffa and Russell having a heart to heart. I about cried when Jimmy Hoffa knew he was about to get whacked, but he still didn’t know it would be Frank. Just the simple utterance of:

###“Let’s get out of here, Frank.”

Broke my heart. Great movie. Small detail- Hoffa was furious after waiting 15 minutes for Tony, but he waited 40 minutes for Frank and wasn’t even that upset. He really loved and trusted him. There was a nice jolt of recognition when I realized that the actress playing Hoffa's wife was also Lois, the cranky babysitter from Goodfellas.

Its also fun going though The Irishman spotting familiar faces from The Sopranos and Boadwalk Empire in the massive cast. The entire scene for the ceremony dinner at the casino banquet will be a thing of movie legend. Pacino eating his steak staring at them with menace. Deniro pleading with Pacino to wise up. Pacino and Pesci having a scene together for the first and only time in their careers (while a concerned Deniro looks on from a distance). Pesci awarding Deniro the ring. It’s so much and it’s so fucking amazingly done and acted. So much fun watching Ray Romano and Al Pacino acting off one another. ",1
23," Timothee Chalamet’s “yo you game?!?” line to Leo’s wife got the biggest laugh out of me It was pretty obvious the Bash CEO was Bezos, Elon, Jobs, and a whole bunch of other greedy assholes rolled into one, but I think one less obvious parody they rolled into there was Marshall Applewhite, leader of the Heaven's Gate cult. Look and spoke EXACTLY like him, and their whole deal was escaping on a spacecraft as a comet passed the earth. I really enjoyed that little nod. ""It's just a different generation."" Just finished it on Netflix - when it comes to end of the world movies I appreciate in a depressing way movies that actually follow through with the destruction of the world instead of some last minute miracle Just saw it. Alternately funny/infuriating/depressing/beautiful. Definitely one of my favorite movies of the year. Walked out of the theater in a bit of a daze. Still processing it. Loved it. I really enjoyed this. To me Rylance was the MVP. There is something so deliberately off-putting about the way he plays Isherwell, it's honestly astonishing. I thought the movie handled it's messaging quite well. When dealing with a subject as maddening as the ways in which our power structures makes it so that cataclysmic events go completely unchallenged, I think completely throwing subtlety out the door was the right way to approach the story. I also think some of the criticism of the movie being unsubtle has to do with the way COVID played out. Yes, the media and politicians act exactly the same as during COVID. But the movie was written before. Kate’s obsession with General Themes taking their money for the free snacks was my favorite part of this film. Saw it today, thought it was pretty good, although I could have done without Ariana Grande and Kid Cudi’s characters, but her song was pretty good lol

Really loved some of the performances (DiCaprio per usual) but the MVP’s were Perlman and Rylance for me. Both stole the show in their limited screen time Someone shouting ""I'm doing an 8 ball"" near the end cracked me up Deep Impact and Armageddon came out when I was a teenager.  I feel like ""Don't Look Up"" is the perfect satire for someone of my age.  I found myself laughing for the first half or so.  Then the laughter kind of turned into nervous laughter when it started to hit me that this story was so uncomfortably close to reality.  

>!When the protagonists came up with the line, ""Just Look Up"", there was a small part of me that was rooting for the world to unite behind them.  But knowing the title of the movie, I knew there was no way it would work.  Also, the scene where Jennifer Lawrence goes to visit her parents was oddly reminiscent of how the relationship with my own family and my in-laws has evolved over time (don't worry, it's not THAT bad).  !<

Really bummed I didn't stay for the end END credits scene.  I'll have to watch it again on Netflix. The performances really sell this movie I loved jonah hill and chalamet. Obviously the plot hits you over the head but its mostly a vehicle for laughs for me. I'm still laughing at how deep that general got under J. Law's skin with that water and snack move. I’m in the minority, but I loved this movie. Yes it’s over the top, but given how crazy the past few years have been, it makes sense. If I saw this in 2011 I would’ve thought it was unrealistic, but 2021 is sadly a different story I absolutely loved this film but understand why it would rub some viewers the wrong way. Yes, it has the subtly of a comet impact but god damn if it isn’t an enjoyable and memorable ride.

I’m a huge fan of McKay’s kinetic filmmaking style and the script strikes a perfect balance between darkly hilarious and outright depressing. I don’t think I’ve flipped flopped between laughter and existential dread this much since Bojack Horseman.

Performance-wise, Mark Rylance is the real unsung hero here. His off-kilter performance steals every scene he’s in.

In short, this is clear case of Adam McKay doing Adam McKay, will all the highs and lows you’d expect. If you liked Vice and The Big Short, you’ll likely like this. If you thought those were too preachy, don’t expect otherwise here. The repeated editing trick of ending scenes in the middle of sentences made me laugh every time Cate blanched is sexy as hell SPOILER:


Let's all talk about the fact that Leo has added another ""death"" to his movie credentials. 

anyways, fav part was Jonah saying ""Fine you wanna come"" and then slamming the door. Rofl > Overall, great movie and unfortunately I feel like it’s not far off from what might happen if a similar situation occurred in 2022. Seriously

When I first learned of the premise of the film, I thought to myself, “oh, that is going to be about COVID. The last two years have been terrible, I don’t want to watch a movie about how terrible the last two years have been.”

But then ended up seeing it anyway.. and I was very wrong.

The film is not about COVID. It’s not about what *could* happen.

This film is about what *is* happening, right now, with climate change.

Climate change is a giant comet hurdling towards earth. There are scientists trying to break through the din. But it’s not working and we’re all going to die :( You can see Meryl Streep almost break character and laugh a couple times when Jonah Hill is talking, especially because I think he was ad libbing. At the political rally she looks down because it seems like she’s trying not to laugh So we all gonna ignore that Matthew Perry didn’t make the final cut ? Another random comment I have after digesting the movie for a day: holy shit Timothee Chalamet is hilarious and they need to cast him in more comedies ""Your dad and I are for the jobs the comet will create."" Man can we talk about that last scene? The way everyone is trying to have a mundane conversation to take their mind off things but there's just this hint of panic under their faces. Just brilliant acting. And the freeze frames on their faces trying to hold it together as the world around them begins to crumble, full on exploding in JLaw's case. Excellent directing and editing.

I thought the movie overall was ok but that ending was phenomenal. [removed] ",1
71," “i sent you a mold of my foot plz respond” The ""Saoirse Ronan moves to New York and has multiple love interests"" trilogy is now complete. I love how the past was shot with a warm filter, and the present a cool one so if you couldn't figure it out contextually you had a clear understanding of which was which! From Jo and Laurie’s fight - is the line that ends it: “and ill watch” from the novel? Boy did it destroy me This movie needs a Bob Odenkirk trigger warning.  When he just hops into the film all of a sudden about an hour and a half into it, it's a bit jarring.  My wife and I couldn't stop laughing at his mere presence, let alone the mutton chops. Beth was so weird and sweet. I loved her. It was great that she had a personality outside of being “The Sick One.” Loved the theme of money and ownership in regards to women. Loved how Greta Gerwig blended Louisa May Alcott’s own story into the film. Alcott never married. The film’s end showed that it was the ownership of her own book that truly fulfilled her. One of my favs of the year. Just commenting to say that “12 year old” Florence Pugh in Dutch braids surrounded by actual other 12 year olds made me laugh out loud at the ridiculous contrast. Other than that and Chamalamalamalet clearly not aging through the whole movie, i really enjoyed it.

Edit: I also missed the instructive and helpful marmee portrayed by Susan Sarandon. I worship Laura Dern, but I’m not convinced that she really did justice to the character. 

One scene of her saying she was “ashamed of her country” isn’t really comparable to “If you feel your value lies in being merely decorative, I fear that someday you might find yourself believing that’s all that you really are. Time erodes all such beauty, but what it cannot diminish is the wonderful workings of your mind: Your humor, your kindness, and your moral courage. These are the things I cherish so in you. I so wish I could give my girls a more just world. But I know you’ll make it a better place.” I loved the whole movie but I have to say one of my all time favorite scenes I've ever seen on the big screen was the ""gentlemen's club"" scene where they are dressed as older men with the pipes. Genuinely hilarious and love that Laurie was hiding the whole time. The reveal that Bob Odenkirk plays their father is the fastest I’ve ever gone from crying to losing my shit in a movie. I think the most memorable scene of the movie for me is Amy's economical factor in choosing a husband monologue inside the painting workshop. It was a single take where the camera focuses and tracks with Pugh's face as she moves toward Laurie. The controlled delivery says so much, it adds a silent subtext to what was spoken. It conveys a woman in a time where it is un-lady-like to burst out how she really feels, yet the measured tone tells us so much more is hidden beneath the surface. Furthermore, her perfect articulation of the matter hints her intellect and how often she thinks about this unfair world, refining each time she is reminded that life, fate, and society have constantly placed her being second to someone else whether in being a sister of talent, a love interest, an artist, and a woman.

Edit: grammar and clarity The hard cut from Amy confessing that she loved Laurie to her 7 years prior sending him a mold of her feet is pretty much my entire dating life. THAT scene between Saoirse and Timothee was stunning. Thought the whole film was excellent but that scene...damn The ending was so meta with Jo writing a happily ever after for her protagonist, parallel with Louisa May Alcott being forced to write a romantic ending for her novel. ""Under the Umbrella"" is even the name of the last chapter in ""Little Women"", if my memory is correct. The flashbacks were a little confusing. Also, I was not convinced that Laurie was in love with Amy. He really wanted to be part of the March family and he was going to do so in any way he could. saoirse is fucking fire damn she can act. Holy crap a movie with over five A-List actors that is a solid film. I enjoyed it. Greta managed to turn a 500+ page book into a solid two and some change length movie. I love this movie so much. Just the kind of film you want to live in. I’ve seen it twice now and both times I found someone new to grab onto and follow emotionally. The first time I was fully into Jo’s journey, but the second time I was way more attuned to Amy (and also more cognizant of Beth). I can’t wait to go again and have another completely new experience (I also can’t wait to see this with an actual audience). 

Also, while the contrasting Christmas scenes absolutely destroyed me (the hold on Jo’s face is perfect), it hurt a lot more when Mr. Laurence is hovering outside his own mansion, afraid to go inside because he knows Beth won’t be there, and Jo offering to help go inside with him. This film does so well at carrying over what I liked most about Lady Bird: making me care about the side characters almost as much as the main characters. None of the Little Women are American actresses. 2 English, 1 Irish, and 1 Australian. 

I found that interesting at least since none of them sounded naturally American even Saoirse. We are just here to witness Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh’s careers. Jesus those two can act. YOU WILL BE BORED OF HIM IN 2 YEARS BUT WE WILL BE INTERESTING FOREVER!!! My girlfriend forced me to go, no regrets. I cried at least twice. Don’t tell anyone. I’m a little confused by the meta ending. 

It’s frustrating because I personally love Friedrich Bhaer’s character in the book because I believe he propels Jo to become a writer of passion rather than just profit.

**But** what exactly does Jo and Friedrich’s ending imply in this adaptation? 😕 Non-linear structure was a fresh way to engage with this story.  Such a great choice. LADY BIRD WAS NOT A FLUKE. My poor 15 year old brother liked the movie much more than I believed he would, but he just told me he didn’t realize the story was non-linear.  I asked, and he didn’t question how Beth had died in one scene and then moments later she was talking to her sisters.  He DEFINITELY didn’t pick up on the changing color palettes, bless his heart.

Other than my brother’s absent-mindedness, (I am in no way blaming the movie for his entire lack of awareness) I truly loved this movie. Certainly one of my favorites this year. ",1
110," Sorrento's avatar looked like a combination of Superman, Fred Flintstone and Human Shrek.  “I'm not crazy about reality, but it's still the only place to get a decent meal.”

― Groucho Marx So I understand that this isn't really a perfect movie. It's a little bit hurried, and the characters and story aren't anything to go nuts over...

But dammit, I've missed this Spielberg for so long. We sort of got it with Tintin, but this is the shamelessly sentimental, adventure loving Spielberg I grew up on, and the one that really made me love film. It's a fucking blast, and I absolutely loved it.

And holy shit, Olivia Cooke needs to be in more movies. She's talented as hell. What was that ship from which Gundam comes out of? I thought it resembled Serenity. I may be super wrong though.  Say what you will about the plot (which I enjoyed), but goddamn can Spielberg direct an action scene. The first challenge race and the final battle were some of the coolest, funnest action sequences I've seen in a long time. Sometimes I forget that Spielberg is the king of the blockbuster for a reason. The moment when everyone in the cinema gasped at the reveal that the quarter is giving Parzival an extra life is seared into my brain. Love it. Can someone please explain to me how everyone figured out where the last challenge was and how they figured out ot was in a video game? I felt like part of the movie just got chopped out and I missed that part Wait so there were cops the whole time?! IOI is literally abducting people and forcing them into camps and the police only show up at the very end?!  The Shining sequence absolutely blew my mind. So incredibly fun to see Spielberg dip into *his* inner fanboy and pay tribute to his former mentor with such a detailed recreation of the Overlook and Room 237. The images were so clear as well! Wonder if they used original footage and restored it or if everything was digitally recreated. Any pg13 film that uses its one ""fuck"" to have a random dude scream ""it's fuckin Chucky!"" Is alright by me. I was ready for a ""You stay. I go"" moment from Iron Giant. Pleasantly surprised they went with the ending of T2! This had some truly staggering scenes, there were times when I couldn't believe what I was witnessing.

That said, it is very hokey in places and has pacing issues and characters just randomly appearing to help the protagonist at just the right moment.

That Shining scene though, Holy fuck and the race sequence and the Mecha godzilla.

Jesus.  Simon Pegg playing an American imitating a British accent gave me a chuckle That fucker played Oddjob in GoldenEye. Did anyone notice the film grain during the shining sequence? I thought that was a really cool little detail Is it me or did the Asian dude have replicant eyes when he was holding Nolan at gunpoint? ""You killed my mom's sister!"" 
You mean Aunt? How the hell do you throw the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch without counting to 3 (5) first?  I think the thing this movie lacked most was the feeling of time. In the book sometimes months or a year would go by in between finding a clue or gaining a key. And in that time a lot of character and relationship building happens, that you just lose in the film. Having Wade tell Artemis he loved her basically their first date was just a little cringey for me. I wanted to see them build their relationship, see him get dumped, see him try to redeem himself within the IOI system and then they finally meet in the real world. Time is what I feel the movie was missing. Did anyone else find it weird how the movie basically skims over the death of Wade’s aunt? I know they weren’t really close, but there’s not even one moment of mourning for the woman who helped raise him. It cuts immediately from “murder of family” to “awkward romance”. Felt like a distracting tonal shift. This whole time...  all I wanted was one asshole shouting ""Leeroy Jenkins"" and then, quickly getting vaporized. “I will choose the form of Gundam!”
Theater goes wild Are you seriously telling me that in four years not one single person decided to just fuck about and drive backwards on that race? Shout out to the one dude which out of EVRYTHING that he could be, he chose to be a fucking skeleton. Did it annoy anyone else that hundreds of citizens in the stacks were defending Wade until the second one man pulls out a pistol? ",0
130," If you want to discuss the film more in-depth, be sure to visit /r/Dunkirk. Watching the timelines finally sync up was so immensely satisfying. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkirk_evacuation): 
>For every seven soldiers who escaped through Dunkirk, one man was left behind as a prisoner of war.

Farrier :( Pretty sad watching the French soldier go back to rescue his friend only to drown in the boat later from the same people he rescued from the sinking ship.

Edit: French, sorry. Typed it without thinking  Still can't believe that guy tried to shit on the beach 5 minutes in, got interrupted and then held it the whole movie.  The scene with Cillian Murphy at night time may be my favorite scene in the movie. I forgot exactly what he said but his character was so calm and looked like a true leader when he was telling the boys there wasn't any room left on the boat and they'd be ok. The contrast with how shaken up he was when he was picked up by the family was incredible. It really showed what war could do to a person.  I like how the clock stopped ticking just as the fuel on the plane ran out. I don't know how I didn't pick up on that sooner  Torpedo scene was nuts  Now waiting for sequel about Tom Hardy breaking out of Nazi prison wolfenstein-style. **Potential Spoilers**

I never felt so claustrophobic watching a movie, the amount of screams from inside the sinking boat got to me. If I was to describe this movie in one word. It would be sad, just seeing the amount of attempts the men we're making trying to get off the beach, meanwhile others just stayed lining up because they knew it was no use. 

""The tide has turned.""

""How do you know""

""The bodies are coming back"" Things I've learned today; every dude at Dunkirk was unfairly good looking.  Tom Hardy, unanimous MVP of The Battle of Dunkirk That was the least gory war movie I think I've ever seen, considering the action. I think the only time you really saw blood was from poor George, which is ironic because he wasn't even ""in"" the war. 

Great movie, IMAX was too incredible to explain, you have to see it to understand.   Saw Weezer last Friday. Dunkirk was louder. 
 Can the Brits queue or can the Brits queue? Just remembering some of the really grim shit in this:

- The guy getting blown out of frame at the start

- The dude on a stretcher who clearly didn't get out of the sinking boat

- The oil being set alight and soldiers burning up as they resurfaced. Fucking hell. Oh man, that scene where Tom Hardy's last buddy makes a water landing and having a sigh of relief that he's alive and waving at him, and Farrier waves back, only to find out later that his buddy was actually stuck and submerging.  I'm surprised to have not already seen this here so I may be alone in this, but I felt that the most passionate and emotional scene in the movie was when Peter (the sailor's son) told Cillian Murphy's traumatized character that George would be okay despite knowing that he was dead. A beautiful display of compassion and grace. Nobody here has mentioned the most tense scene for me: The abandoned boat. The target practice, the accusations, the Dutch guy. All of that built into an incredible scene. The rest of the movie was spectacular but I thought that was the most suspenseful part. The panic of that last private waking up to an empty beach was surreal. Nolan's choice to keep the enemy concealed for essentially the entire film was genius. You knew that the French and British forces were being attacked by the advancing Germans but you never knew when or where they were going to attack. Kept me in a unique, gripping sort of suspense that I hadn't experienced in a movie before. Amazing.  Every shot in the air was incredible That shot when the bombs were dropping closer and closer to Tommy on the beach was one of my favorite shots ever. Did anyone else's jaw drop when they cut to Cillian Murphy giving orders on that one boat? That up-and-coming Tom Hardy has really made a name for himself in the film industry these past 5 years.

He's gone from 5 seconds of onscreen face time in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" to maybe a good 20 seconds here in ""Dunkirk.""

Excited for what's next. ",1
14," Ercole broke the lame disney streak of hidden villains by being a dick and just getting *worse* as the movie went on lol I was waiting the whole movie for some tragic backstory to explain why Ercole is the way he is. 

Turns out he’s just a dick and I much prefer that When Luca gets pulled out of the water and Alberto asks him “First time?” and Luca relies “Of Course it is! I’m a good kiiiiiid 😩” that was the cutest shit ever lol So what's a guy gotta do to get a recipe for trenette a pesto? man, those basil leaves and little mozzarella balls were just gorgeous Loved it. Just so Lowe stakes.
The dad was this amazing character. He was such a softy. They kinda showed it where he said like ""nah I was born this way"" I loved this movie. From then light hearted but meaningful storyline to the amazingly beautiful animation. People always want the next Soul or Inside Out but movies like Luca are just as good. So I'm pretty sure Bruno is Alberto's dad's name, right? I’m starting an Easter egg thread.  

Film nerd stuff:

- Posters in the background are visible for Roman Holiday (1953), La Strada (1954), and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954).

- When Luca and Julia are going over the roofs to the telescope, there’s a TV briefly playing Italian caper film “A Big Deal on Madonna Street” (1958).

- The first boat we see is the Gelsomina, named after one of the main characters in “La Strada.”  Masimo’s boat is the Elena, maybe a “Coco” reference.

- The photo stuck to the Vespa handle is of 
Italian movie star Marcello Mastroianni.  Looks like it might be from when he did “Divorce, Italian Style” due to the moustache.

- I think it’s been confirmed that the town name 
Portorosso is a reference to Studio Ghibli’s “ Porco Rosso” which also takes place on the Italian coast.  The credits sequence with sketches showing everyone’s future adventures is used in a lot of Ghibli films like “ My Neighbor Totoro” and “ Kiki’s Delivery Service.” Why does Maya Rudolph play the mom in every animated movie and why does it catch me off guard every time? The bully kid looked like a young Chef Skinner from *Ratatouille*. I really \*loved\* the ending. I thought it was nice that Alberto stayed behind with the dad (after having lost his own father), and didn't follow Luca and Giulia. Every character got their own happy ending. This movie told the story about redemption and forgiveness that Raya and the Last Dragon wanted to tell. I love that the Pixar movies just always seem to be getting more beautiful looking. The city setting itself was just so alive and fun, but I was blown away by the first island and how the scenery looked. This met my expectations and then some. Part of me thought the antagonist's fate was gonna be him accidentally stabbing himself with the harpoon, especially with the way he started surfing on the bike This felt very emotional as an Italian to watch. It's not as big of a movie as some of the known masterpieces from Pixar but I loved it nonetheless. “Made in our slippers in various parts of the Bay Area” My name is Luca. I live on the ocean floor... The Italian is so aggressive in this movie that it needs Giorno’s theme There seems to be a narrative going around that its one of Pixar’s weaker fare on the level of Good Dinosaur and maybe part of that is because it went straight to Disney+.

But I have to say I did not find that to be the case. Perhaps my expectations were lowered because of the discussion surrounding the film but I enjoyed it quite a bit.

Sure the stakes are lower and its not pushing any boundaries creatively like Inside Out or Soul but its much closer to Pixar’s usual quality than something like Good Dinosaur.

The lighthearted, warm kids story with a strong message worked really well and the smaller scale and stakes made it much more relatable and whimsical to me.

Some of the comparisons to Call Me By Your Name are fair but to its strength I think.

I definitely recommend checking it out to those on the fence. “Some people, they will never accept him, but some will. And he seems to know how to find the good ones.” That hit me HARD Loved it.

Felt it was subtle, but Julias fathers acceptance of the boys wasn't just ""I like her friends"". He had one arm not because of a sea monster, that's just the way that he was born. Same thing. Luca and Alberto were born that way, so what? 

My kid ranked it an 8/10, which is a pretty high score from him. I appreciated how lighthearted and enjoyable this film was. Sure there was a “message” but it was very straightforward and plainly laid out. I liked that there was no complicated twist or unexpected villains like many animated films. It was just a easy-going enjoyable film. Best Vespa commercial of all time. I love, love, love this movie. When I first saw the trailer for it a month or two ago, at first I dismissed it as being something forgettable and silly. But within’ the last few weeks as more trailers came out, suddenly I was super excited to see it. Was counting down the days until today, and I really enjoyed it. The animation was adorable, and I loved the story and characters. I really liked Alberto, he was hiding so much loneliness and insecurity behind that confident demeanor. This is my favorite to come out of Pixar in a long long time! At this point Pixar is just straight flexing their animation being the best there is. ",0
4," I loved the tension between Peter and Phil in their last scene together. 

Peter’s character surprised me the most, and I didn’t think he could be that calculating. I think the main problem is that the main theme in the book was discarded completely, namely that of parents who are not there at all for their children (both physically and mentally). 

The title of the book and the movie is one of the Psalms - the one that starts O father why hast thou forsaken me. This is also what Jesus said on the cross, when he doubted his father. I think it can be argued that a very big theme in the book is parents who are distant and not very good parents.

This explains why no one in the book/movie ever calls their parent ""mother"" or ""father"" - it's always ""the old man/lady"" or ""rose"". The book has lots of scenes about the parents of the different characters that have been omitted in the movie. 

And another thing. Phil's parents KNOW he is gay. They are ok with it as long as he lives far away from them with his dimwit brother who is ALSO a disgrace to the family. In the book there is a heart breaking scene where the parents console each other and assure themselves that ""it is not our fault"" (that Phil ended up as he did).

Taking out the bitter criticism of the parental generation and of parents who do not take responsibility for their kids leaves the story a little thin in my opinion. The refreshing thing about this movie is that it’s a Western that doesn’t end with a shootout. It uses the Western setting perfectly without falling into the boring tropes of the genre. Something I'm unsure about - Is cattle ranching a truly lucrative career? Or were the Burbank boys LARPING as cowboys because they come from old money and can do as they please? I figured it was the latter, which adds a layer of regressivessness to Phil, but I'm not so sure. I don't get the hype. It was fine but I can't understand how it's Oscar worthy. Sure, it's artsy but it's not overly entertaining As awful as Phil was, it was oddly sad to see him walking around, half dead already, desperately trying to get that rope to Peter, not knowing that Peter was the one that killed him. I was really surprised to see Thomasin McKenzie in a minor role that didn‘t matter at all. I mean she’s not an A-lister but a bit too important to play “random maid #1“. Can someone explain the rings at the end? Was confused about that scene. The nesting birds in the tree was a very powerful scene. Peter not paying a single bit of attention to the ranch hands yelling profanities at him, and instead confidently walking over to the tree to observe the birds. Clearly a turning point in the movie in terms of how Phil views Peter. 

Phil sees in Peter something that he could never do, be confident and open with his sexuality. So Phil envied that aspect of Peter, and in turn invited Peter to learn from him. Albeit we quickly see Phil's true agenda is to strip away and remold Peter into something more reminiscent of himself. I'm assuming by doing this Phil could have another Bronco. If Phil is able to turn Peter into a cowboy, then they could go onto have a romantic relationship just like Phil and Bronco did. I watched this movie last night and I have been getting sadder about it all day. So I read all 567 comments on this thread. Only a few mentioned having felt sad about the thing that absolutely seems to have gutted me. That is Phil's betrayal and murder, and this in spite of that fact that in terms of modern conventions of morality and sensibilities about bullying, racism, misogyny, and homophobia, Phil only really got what was coming to him. This also in spite of the fact that, like several other commenters, the atmosphere of dread and fear in the house because of Phil was immediately recognizable and viscerally real to me because my Dad was like that. Some people didn't understand Rose's paralysis in the face of it but I do. It's not the cruelty alone that breaks you down. It's your own powerlessness to confront it that does you in.

That said, the most powerful storylines in the world for me are the redemption ones. That's why I loved Bram Stoker's Dracula back in the day. Cumberbatch so remarkably portrayed a guy with a vast inner life that was utterly alone and which would be completely illegible to anyone in his universe that his viciousness reads as a snarling, biting rage and hate for a world that first hated him and that taught him to hate himself. He has only ever been loved once, and the memory of the power and wonder of it gives him what internal life he has.  So, in a way that this world's valorization of toxic masculinity has taught us, the audience, to admire as much is it informed Phil's brutal performance of what in fact was once the masculine ideal, he teaches all around him to fear him as totally unassailable. He pulls it off with a certain flair, maintaining a panache and keen and cruel wit that leads a certain kind of person to also admire him. And he surrounds himself with that kind of men. 

In order for this movie to work, you have to believe in the possibility of an inner life that is at once enormous and hidden. We see it in Phil's ""secret place,"" in which he enters his inner life and lets his inner self out into the light in the safety of solitude. There is a striking moment when Peter finds his way to the edge of the pond where Phil is bathing and Phil turns his head, sees the intruder, and instantly dons the mantle of a wolf, reflexively and almost animalistically driving the intruder away from his exposed and vulnerable self. 

Benedict Cumberbatch said of Phil's character that, if the movie had done its work, you came to understand that Phil wasn't a monster, and that to the extent we as a people can empathize with him we progress, and to the extent we only wish him harm we stagnate. I was glad I read that, because it validated my sense that this movie was and could only be understood as tragic if we had come to value Phil's life. 

The reason it gutted me was that Phil was tiptoeing toward finding connection with someone. He was finally starting to trust. That is such a terrifying place to be, we've all feared the horror of what it would mean to trust someone with some truth of ourselves and to be met with cruelty or ridicule or rejection. The shame, the embarrassment, the grief of it are among those things I think we fear more than anything else; certainly it was the thing Phil feared the most. And so here we have this guy who is godawful and vicious but whose feral self-defensiveness is protecting something pure against a world that is just as horrible to him as he is to it, who is finally taking small steps toward what could be redemptive. But he has trusted someone he probably felt safe around, based on the mistaken assumption that Peter was weak and therefor not a threat. And he is made a fool of in it; what he sees as tenderness is actually concealing the reality that what he thought was an emerging connection was false, and even through the last evening in the barn when the two were close and almost intimate, Peter is pretending all along as he methodically is carrying out Phil's murder. 

When I heard that final line, that it could have been anthrax, and George saying that Phil never handled sick animals, and my mind started going back over the events of the last half the movie, I at first shied away from the obvious conclusion. I mean, I read reviews before I watched the movie, I knew there was going to be something tragic, and I figured Phil was going to kill someone, or drive someone to suicide. But in spite of the fact I was waiting for tragedy, I was not prepared for Peter to have killed Phil. In the end, in spite of every sadistic, cruel thing he was, I mourned Phil. Can someone explain to me the meaning behind Phil and baths? And him putting the mud on himself then taking a bath?

And the hulahoop scene? Haha Hi all,

I just re-watched this movie again last night with my father, I haven't read the book, so please forgive my ignorance if this is mentioned in it. 

We were catching all the subtle hints sprinkled throughout the feature, but, one thing that really stood out to us, was the scene where Rose is asking Peter if there's if there's a sound that makes him shutter. To which he denies. But, then, you can see he begins to get teary eyed and begins to pluck the comb teeth again.

Now, I missed the similarity of the sound relation entirely. But my dad said, ""oohhhhhh, the comb sounds like a rope under tension!"" y'know.. Kinda like how Peter found his father? *creak* *creak*

And it all made a whole lot more sense, the animosity that was had towards Phil, once one redditor had revealed they'd left out the crucial information from the book, that he'd actually tormented the boys father, much like he does the everyone.

Great movie. Thoughts:

1. ""Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog"" = Deliver Peter from toxic masculinity; deliver Rose from alcoholism.   
I've seen people saying that the ""dog"" refers to Phil, but in this case I think it is a play on words. ""Hair of the dog"" (short for ""Hair of the dog that bit you"") refers to alcohol that is consumed with the purpose of curing a hangover. Peter wants to save his mother from alcoholism, and he needs to change Phil or get rid of him to do that.   

2. Peter's dad hung himself with a rope.   
Phil was making a rope for Peter; the rope was intended to help Peter metaphorically kill himself (personality-wise), to become a ""man"" in Phil's eyes.  
Peter keeps making the comb sound throughout the film, which as another redditor here pointed out, sounds like a creaking rope. The film makes you feel like Peter and Rose are slowly suffocating, like they are already hanging but not dead.   

3. Phil seems to starts to change in the end, but it is too little too late. He loses the hides (which he wanted to keep to make the rope, to form a bond with peter) because he has always burned them, and so people assumed he is just going to destroy and burn them.   
Phil metaphorically burns people, too. Even if he was truly planning on changing his behavior towards peter and his mother, it was already too late; he had already established his behavior and so people dont trust him. Does anyone else think that Peter could have killed his father?  He tells Phil he found him and cut him down.  If he was drunk all the time could Peter have killed him?  He was the only witness to his death.  Play close attention to the beginning of the movie when Peter is narrator.  (“What kind of man would I be if I didn’t help my mother, if I didn’t save her?”  His father’s year of death was 1921 on the headstone, it’s now 1925.  How old would Peter have been 4 years ago?  Does Peter just remove anyone that harms his mother? One of my favorite little things about the movie I think is underrated is the sound. Hearing Phil's spurs ring even when he was nowhere near being on-screen really gave you a sense of him always being there, and really added to the aura of power he gives off. I absolutely loved this movie. What a knockout of an ending. Man I got this movie completely wrong. I thought it was a love story between Peter and Phil, in nowhere in my mind think Peter would actually kill him...

I thought Peter was coming to realization that he was different and gay and he saw Phil was experienced in the lifestyle he wanted. Like when Phil woke up that morning all sweaty I thought they fucked, not that he was dying. And when he died, I thought he died from aids from his previous lover. 

Man oh man did I get this movie wrong. What a great performance by Benedict Cumberbatch. Jonny Greenwood's score should be nominated.

I've always been impressed with Jane Campion's work. Her films are often haunting and erotic, with interesting characters and relationships. What's weird is I felt really bad for Phil by the end. He was finally beginning to open up and that was all taken away. I see it as a tragic series of events that leads to his death. Well I think this was a masterpiece. The acting, cinematography, score and direction were stellar and it made good use of the sound design to create this subtle but unrelenting tension. 

It was really compelling for me but I can see how one might find it boring. However,  I don't really understand the reactions in this thread calling it mediocre and lacking in nuance as well as character development. Nothing much happens plotwise but the build-up in tension is masterful and the film gradually reveals a lot about the characters whilst being quite subversive. Not really sure what else people want from it because this is far better than most films which are released. That's just me though. Not trying to invalidate other peoples' opinions. I thought it was pretty good overall. It was an interesting story and the performances are all obviously really solid. The soundtrack was really fitting as well in giving off that uneasy, ominous atmosphere. By the end, the movie gave me vibes of a cross between There Will Be Blood and Brokeback Mountain. 

The only aspect that felt a little off (and it sounds like others feel the same way) and kept it from being a great movie in my mind, was in how most of the characters felt like they reacted to Phil in seemingly disproportionate ways. I know there was a lot of subtlety to his menace and the way he would torment the other characters, and maybe it's just a case of the movie being paced in a weird way, but it felt like his actions usually evoked a response that was simultaneously too passive and too overboard for the other characters. To be clear, I'm not saying ""Phil wasn't actually that bad"" or anything like that. The dude was a grade A asshole for sure. But maybe murdering him with anthrax was a little bit of overkill in terms of dealing with him. I just kept waiting for a moment where someone, anyone, would actually lash out or at least attempt to, and just raise the stakes a little bit. I mean, yeah, Rose sold off his pelts against his wishes, but that was after she'd already basically given up and resorted to alcohol to deal with her issues. I feel like it would have been more effective if she'd tried fruitlessly to confront Phil, only for her situation to not improve, and then start to break down from there. But for a large part of the movie, Phil is just a bully and everyone tiptoes around him rather than doing anything about it. I thought Peter's scheme in the back half of the movie was a good change of pace in that it felt like one of the characters was finally stepping up to do something, and the characters were finally starting to actually play off each other. The most interesting aspect of the movie was that sort of inverse dynamic of Peter ""seducing"" Phil with the ultimate intent to get revenge, especially when you consider how you know Phil probably thinks he's the one grooming Peter and getting one over on Rose, and I kind of wish more of the movie was centered around that dynamic. It was sort of like the predator doesn't realize he's actually the prey. But when it came to Rose and George, it seemed like they never reacted to Phil with any sense of agency, which wouldn't be a problem if Phil was portrayed as exerting genuine power over them, but it never felt to me like Phil was so overbearing and so overtly abusive as to actually restrict the other characters' agency. And if he was and it was just too subtle to pick up on it, then I still wish those characters would have put up some kind of resistance to it. I think I just found myself frustrated that Rose and George never actually confronted Phil in any meaningful way. It very much feels like a movie where the characters just don't quite feel connected to each other in a satisfying way, which is to say that the performances and writing of the characters are great on an individual basis, but they sort of feel incompatible together. To put it a different way, the individual parts were greater than the sum of those parts, in my opinion. I was super excited to see this movie, and it left me lukewarm. I have no problem with de-construction, but this one just didn’t do it for me. It’s extremely well shot, Cumberbatch is really good, and the score is good, but otherwise I think it’ll be one of those movies that’s forgotten by next year. My favorite scene was when she’s practicing the piano and can’t get it right, and then Phil on the banjo joins in to mock her. I wanted a post-credits scene where Dunst is struggling at the piano, and Plemons walks in and says ""My love, I've got you a teacher!"" and in walks Holly Hunter Can someone explain to me why Rose was unhappy when the governor and George’s parents visited? Why she refused to play the piano? Does anyone else think that George's well-dressed behavior since the beginning of the movie might be a new habit?

That he is trying to change and is already going to Rose's house interested in her, hence the clothes.

That's why Phil teases him from the beginning, because he already knows.

The difference between Phil and George's clothes play a narrative role. And maybe his ""dressing better""\* is his attempt to be something other than a cowboy. Which also bothers Phil. ",1
28," For a Ryan Reynolds produced movie a lot of characters sure were open about how hot a character looking exactly like Ryan Reynolds is. The scene where she tells him to turn around and he's just like ""okay!"" And does a little spin with a stupid smile on his face had me rolling.

This was such a happy movie! Cheesy as hell and everything I expected it to be. I'm a sucker for Ryan Reynolds. Hey Keys, maybe be a bro and program a Millie into the game so Guy isn’t hanging around “unable to find love” forever Evans got the biggest reaction, but when Tatum first appeared at the beginning of the movie, the people beside me were debating if it was him or not. They lost it when it became pretty clear it was him. Still doesn’t beat his cameo in This Is The End though. I loved DUDE's unfinished nature. The T-shirt icon on his pectorals, his 'catchphrase', and the fact that Antwan convinced the Art nerds to just throw on a gold chain before anything else. Hilarious. Tired: “They referenced Marvel, Star Wars, Valve games, Mega Man, and Fortnite!”

Wired: “They referenced the [greatest movie scene](https://youtu.be/mikj8eDKxMQ) of all time.” Catchphrase! I loved the background stuff, there was one scene were a background player kept jumping into a wall and lagging around the place which I thought was so spot on. I even didn't mind the cameos from streamers/YouTubers either, I thought it was a real nice touch to include them. Was the guy Mills gets the info from then kills Hugh Jackman?? Ted Lasso and Free Guy being two successes during the pandemic really makes you think. 

Maybe the American people just want something wholesome and fun with the rough 18 months we’ve been through. 

I’m all for it You can see the exact moment Disney and Fox merged in this movie The Chris Evans cameo made me laugh Taika Waititi being in both The Suicide Squad (although more of a cameo) and Free Guy in consecutive weeks and both being great films. The Alex Trebek Cameo actually made me a bit sad I was not expecting that OFFICER JOHNNY!!!! I liked that Guy wasn’t the only NPC who was evolving. The barista and the bombshell companion character both had their own growth. Well that was about as god damn wholesome as it gets. As an immigrant in New Zealand, this movie definitely hit the ""kiwi cinema goers go wild for Taika Waititi showing up in a film"" that I've come to expect.

I really enjoyed it. It's a fun movie, with lots of homages to other movies, and a genuinely interesting story. Is it the best movie in the world? No. Does it need to be? No. I liked it more than I expected to, to be honest.

One of my favourite things about it was the friendship between Guy and Buddy. They could easily have had Buddy just stay as an irrelevant NPC that Guy outgrows when he realises he's an AI - but those guys genuinely really care for each other and Buddy is always there for him in ways I didn't see coming. I loved that at the end, the friendship between Guy and Buddy was given as much weight as (if not more than) >!the romance between Millie and Keys.!< There were quite a lot of kids in my screening, all of which reacted with laughs and such when the likes of jacksepticeye, DanTDM and Pokimane showed up. I thought it was cute.

Overall, it was a fun movie. Better than I was expecting it to be, honestly. The true hero of this movie is RTX reflections. Every time I saw what ""Free City"" looks like in real life it reminds me of those shitty mobile game ads that look/are nothing like the actual game. This is pretty much the best Saints Row movie or Grand Theft Auto movie ever made. “What the shit?!” Might be bold to say, but I think this is the best movie of the summer. A completely original film beating out a Marvel, DC, and F&F movie is no easy feat. Now we now those  shades in the matrix weren't just silly cosmetics ",0
20," Did anyone else notice the John C Reilly cameo? cant stop thinking about that truck scene

that shit reminded me of SPEED Bradley Cooper’s Jon Peters telling him that they’re both from the streets killed me. I felt like the whole segment was inspired by Kevin Smith’s account of interacting with him Lance saying he’s an atheist to Alaina’s dad at Shabbat dinner was pure gold Bradley Cooper was completely unhinged and was the funniest part of this movie imo. I'm not a big PTA fan in general, but I really loved this movie.  I thought it was funny, beautifully shot, and wonderfully acted.  Alana Haim is rightly getting tons of praise, but I thought Cooper Hoffman also gave one of the best performances of the year.

The movie had really interesting themes about the way we deal with aging and how we view the passage of time.  Gary is a high schooler who isn't satisfied to just enjoy being a kid - he wants to grow up: have a career, start businesses, and be sophisticated.  He relishes being a regular at a nice restaurant, and brags to his friends that he could get them martinis.  It's no wonder he's drawn to an older woman like Alana and tries so hard to impress her.  

Alana, on the other hand, is stuck in a rut and struggling with adulthood.  Spending time with Gary feels like a return to earlier, simpler times.  I think her arc is especially interesting. Throughout the movie, she questions why she's hanging out with Gary and his friends instead of growing up.  After the running out of gas sequence, she seems fed up with how immature Gary is and wants to make a change.  She starts working in Sachs' office, and her relationship with Gary changes noticeably - she starts getting annoyed at him for messing up tasks and for not thinking about the  bigger picture beyond himself and his friends.  This continues up until the scene where Sachs invites her for a drink, only to reveal that she is being used as a cover.  Once Alana is reminded of how bleak and horrible the adult world can be, her first reaction is to go find Gary.  Both characters are struggling to be satisfied with where they are in their lives, and are using the other one to fill what they feel is missing. 

Most nostalgia movies show a glossy version of the past where characters are at the peak of their lives.  Licorice Pizza is a throwback movie that centers around two characters who are fundamentally unhappy with the stage of life they're in.  I found that really interesting.  It's definitely a somewhat bittersweet movie, but it's highly watchable and it leaves you with a lot to think about. Let Me Roll it…perfect vibe for the scene that was in. I like that the two main characters are normal looking people. More Haim dad, please Watching this I felt like I was watching a modern classic. Loved it so much, especially Bradley Cooper and Bennie Safdie's arcs...

Then the ending went and ruined it.

To me, Alana's friendship with Gary needed to stay platonic from a consent standpoint, and also because Gary represents Alana's refusal to grow up. Her conversation with the gay man gave me the impression that she was going to choose not to have a romance with Gary. She should have reconciled with Gary, made it explicitly clear that their relationship was platonic, and then left him disappointed but better for it; end of movie. Alana choosing romance is creepy and completely goes against that character trajectory. The movie ends and I'm supposed to feel warm and nostalgic and wistful, but instead I feel awkward and conflicted and angry.

There's still so much to love about the movie, but damn that ending really makes me hesitant to revisit it. So to be clear, Alana is 28, right? In the scene in the truck when she’s talking to Bradley Cooper’s character, it seems like she kinda slips up and says she’s 28 before correcting herself to 25.

I guess that can be interpreted as her lying to look more mature for Cooper’s character, but I’m not sure if that was the intention or not. I might be alone in this, but the age gap really took me out of it. Not just 10 years, but specifically 25 years to 15 years. It's just unrealistic to the point of being absurd. 

Still a very enjoyable film, but I feel like it's a perfect film if either of the characters would have been 19. Frustrating in that regard. I have a serious question.

I LOVE PTA FILMS..but

Did this movie have any character arcs?

Seems like all the characters are the same throughout the movie and never change, grow etc? When they were out of gas and rolling downhill, one if the houses they rolled past looks like the house that was robbed in Boogie Nights I watched this last night and didn’t realize how many characters (including the main character) were based on real-life people. Wikipedia definitely helped with that (please donate $2 to Wikipedia). 

I didn’t even know the story was based on a real person. Or that PTA was married to Maya Rudolph! 

This is a film that has lived in my head for 24 hours despite walking out of the theater thinking, “yeah, that was pretty good.”

I love when films have that effect. You can’t be mad at everyone. 
FUCK YOU DANIELLE I liked how pretty much every man Alana takes an interest in turns out to be an asshole. That includes Gary. I think when Matthew tells her they are basically all assholes she then picks Gary. Lance refusing to do the prayer gets her family mad at her. Jack allows her to fall off the motorcycle and doesn’t care. Joel is using her to appear straight and so on. So much running, and it looked better than any sports movie. I went with my wife and daughter, a 15-year-old cinephile who is ahead of the curve with her knowledge of cinema, and we all loved this movie. I legitimately felt emotional during the opening. After such a tough year for the world, it was truly a wonderful feeling to be sitting in a theater enjoying a new movie from PT Anderson.

And that cameo of John C Reilly as Herman Munster was hilarious.

10/10 loved this movie. Definitely favorite of the year for me too. the ending was weird and abrupt…but as a whole the movie was absolutely brilliant ? 

fuck i just got out the theater and still processing it

the standout scenes for me was the truck scene and the safdie dinner scene which was unexpectedly emotional Am I the only one that felt like Alana was an opportunist when it came to her choice in men I think the only thing I liked about this movie was the soundtrack. I do not understand all the praise it's been getting from critics and in this thread. It was a meandering plot with two mostly unlikable characters leading the way and no real story arc. I found Cooper Hoffman insufferable throughout the film, just did not like that character at all which I hope was the point? The age gap is problematic, but not as much as how weird both of their characterizations were and how they just kind of rolled with it. It's really really fucking weird for a 25 year old to hang out with high school sophomores. That's not my biggest hang-up though, it's mostly with how there were multiple absurd scenes and scenarios that just kind of materialized out of nowhere. With the bad writing and weak dialogues I just couldn't get into it at all. I don't know, this film was mostly hollow and pointless to me. 

It's very strange to read multiple comments in here referencing OUATIH and how this was PTA's take on a similar nostalgia that Tarantino went for. They couldn't have been further apart in quality for me. I loved OUATIH with great pacing and sharp dialogue along with dynamite performances, loathed this one with how weak the product was and bounced before the final 30 minutes. It was kind of entertaining in bits and pieces, but it's just such a shoddy piece of work as a whole. What I loved about this film was how I related to both Gary and Alana. When I was 15, I had so much drive - taking AP classes, in speech and debate, hoping to go to Harvard law. Now that I'm 25, I feel like I'm in Alana's position. My life isn't going how I imagined it would be and I feel somewhat stuck. I'm struggling to hold on to a rapidly dwindling youthfulness while also trying to figure out how to actually make the world a better place. When you're 15, you want to be 25 and when you're 25, you wish you could be 15. I love PTA, and Licorice Pizza is a good movie, but ngl it let me down a bit. I felt the subplots varied wildly in quality and utility. The Bradley Cooper section was my favorite and the most engaging, but I found the Sean Penn subplot completely useless. Thankfully, Cooper Hoffman and Alana Haim carried the movie with their infectious banter, chemistry, and Anderson's excellent dialogue flowing from their mouths. Still, more than any other Anderson film I've seen, I felt self-indulgence and wonky pacing. No reason this movie had to be 2:15.

&#x200B;

Every PTA movie I've seen has improved with repeat viewings, so I'm hoping that's the case here. The movie should have cut to black right when they fell over in front of the theater. ",1
106," So I guess Avengers is doing pretty well huh? As you can probably tell this is one of our most popular threads ever. As some of you may remember for The Last Jedi we discovered that Reddit has a weird problem dealing with threads that have over a hundred thousand comments and we are barreling towards that. Because of that **next Thursday at 7pm PDT there will be a second Infinity War official discussion**. As for now remember to keep suggested sort on and enjoy the discussions. 

**Edit:** [You can see the second thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8gvr6n/official_discussion_avengers_infinity_war/) Holy fuck, Thor has had a bad week. Thor went from the forgotten about Avenger to the funniest and coolest in two movies Hulk too scared to smash. They got a dwarf to play a dwarf that lives on a dwarf star and he dwarfs everyone else “You speak Groot?”
“Yeah, they taught it on Asgard as an elective.” I paid good money to watch Thanos stomp out all my favorite characters and ill be damned if i don't pay to see it again.  Rocket is the last Guardian standing :( and this is the second time he's had to watch Groot die. 

I feel for the little rabbit. I love that the Black Order baited out Scarlet Witch so that Corvus Glaive could make an attempt on Vision.

Black Widow: Where's your friend?

Glaive: I'm in ur base, killing ur dudes I gotta say, the fact that they simultaneously made dinklage a dwarf and the largest character on screen was pure poetry ""It will kill you Thor.""
""Only if I die.""
""That's... what.. killing you means."" They killed black panther while this man still had his own movie in theaters lmao  Can we take a moment to appreciate that Thanos was a threat and character worthy of a decade of buildup? Superhero films get a lot of flak for weak villains but in Thanos I feel like we got a helluva pay off. He's not as self aggrandizing maniacal as he is in the comics while retaining his casual disregard for other life and awe inspiring power. He made me think of Dr. Doom's ""I am the only way forward, such is my burden"" moments personified and it was fantastic. He's such a compelling self assured monster and I loved that your could re-title the film Thanos Origins and it be accurate. Tony Stark returns home to find a positive pregnancy test on the floor is my wild prediction. Rocket: “I have a lot to lose.”
Rocket: loses everything  Thanos got his sunset. This was his movie. Something I haven’t seen anybody mention is Thanos telling Tony that they’re both “cursed with knowledge,” to which Tony replies “My only curse is you.” What an amazing line - Tony has spent every movie since The Avengers struggling with PTSD and paranoia that there’s a larger threat out there, something they weren’t prepared for, to an unhealthy degree. It’s completely consumed him, and now he finally gets to see the thing he fears the most. The Russos have such a great understanding of these characters. I really like the practice of leaving stuff out of trailers - like Thor's new eye and the amount of Infinity Stones in his gauntlet. In a world where keeping stuff a secret is so hard, this is sneaky af.  ""I told you, you'd die for that""

Thor is so badass. Oh shit, half the people on Titan are going to die, I wonder who’ll be left

No wtf this isn’t half

No stop  Last words:

""You will never be a God""

""Please, let the dark magic flow through me... one last time""

""This isn't love""

""I love you""

""Steve...?""

""Get up, this is no place to die""

""I am Groot""

""It was the only way""

""I don't want to go""

""Nick...""

""Motherf.....""

 ""WhY Can'T HuLK juSt BeaT Up ThANoS?""

*opening scene*

""Well, fuck"" ""What master do you serve?""

""Am I supposed to say Jesus? So glad I saw this movie right when it came out. That is an ending that would’ve been ruined by the internet if I would have waited. I laughed WAY too hard when Drax had that insanely huge gun pointed right at this face and he goes “Go on Quill! I can take it....” ",0
